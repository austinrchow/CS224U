"-" -- early draft by Ed Solomon, Chris McQuarrie, Tom DeSanto & Bryan Singer -Men By Ed Solomon Revisions: Chris McQuarrie Tom DeSanto Bryan Singer February 24, 1999 Sounds of a train rolling to a halt, a shrill whistle
- the door of a weathered cattle car as a German soldier steps into frame wearing that familiar gray of the all-too familiar era
He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and frightened people inside
The words are not necessary
The language is not ours and the images say enough
Men, women and children are herded off the train like cattle toward a large open yard
There they huddle until the Germans begin to shout and shove through the mob
- We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the thousands of Jew who pour through each day
Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them
boy who will not die this day
boy who will live to see the end of the war and the world of the future
He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination
The boy looks up at    - a sturdy- looking couple who try to smile and comfort him
The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different directions
Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and terrorizing the lot of them
Suddenly it is clear what they are doing
They are dividing the mob into smaller groups
Soon, the groups themselves become evident
Men from women
Children from adults
The family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and pulled apart
The boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground
Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire so dense, it resembles wool
The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents - along with many others - being restrained by a number of soldiers
The screaming is deafening
And the boy's can be heard above it all
The soldiers seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail child
The farther they get from the fence, the heavier he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as though he were anchored to something
His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he screams until the blood in his face is blue
The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they begin to slip in the mud
They look at one another and then over their shoulders as they hear a sound
groaning, creaking sound
And then the unmistakable twang of wire stretched to snapping
: The fence
The gate that separates the parents
It bows toward them like iron filings to a magnet, and several of the strands of barbed wire have given way
The boy continues to scream as all the other faces simply freeze and wonder
One of the soldiers pulls a wooden baton from his belt and brains the boy violently
He slumps and the soldiers carrying him spring forward as through a rope that was holding them back has been cut
They nearly fall, looking at one another with some concern, some confusion
Then they follow the line of children that has gotten ahead of them
: The boy's parents watch him as he -- as they, are taken away
The rest of their story is as you would expect
- Bright, bright blue framing a blinding white sun
: The cracked, drought-stricken soil of nowhere
: - 1978 group of children at play
Tribal children who, without the help of the titles, could be from any age
They run through a tiny village of tents, playing
Every child holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each other playing their version of tag
As each child is tapped, they chase the others
Each trying to avoid being "it", though never going far enough away to miss the fun
One girl in particular
12, with unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned
She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail
She is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win
She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it
She stands and, when the children see that her stick is broken, they begin to giggle
The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty of children let loose becomes evident
They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace
In the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group begins to chant in their native tongue - a song we have not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting
They begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back
The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer wishing to tag anyone
seems to get an idea
He takes his stick and smacks it across her shoulder
She turns to face the child and another swings his stick across her back with a solid
Before long, mob rule gives way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing
It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene
So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow
The children certainly do
It is snowing for a good ten seconds before the last of them stops
By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to melt instantly on the hot African soil that has never seen snow before
: Adults come out of their huts and in from the fields and the whole of the village is soon gathered around the little girl, staring up from the clear blue sky and the snow that falls from nowhere
From nothing
One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the looks of curiosity become looks of fear
Of superstition
Punctuated by a solid thump
And then another
looks down at his feet and sees a tiny, misshapen ball of ice, no bigger than his eye
He looks at it, bites it, then pops it in his mouth - breath turning to steam
Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are tiny pellets of hail, seeming to increase in number as the snow mysteriously wanes
And the pellets are getting larger
Until they land as hunks
The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her head as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the Earth
Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues
And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the dust, crying
As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming closer than then a few feet or so
- This one a backdrop
Cheap paint and tissue paper hung with hooks on a wall just behind the basket on a full court
As we pull back, we see the skyline of New York, crudely made out with its silhouette buildings of dark gray and black - windows of yellow
Among the famous landmarks represented is the Statue of Liberty, complete with a real light bulb burning in the torch
We are at a prom
The theme is    and the decor has made tragic efforts to show it
The tablecloths are blue, the napkins are blue - far too many of the tuxes are powder blue, and the blue eye shadow is as heavy as expected
Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" gives painful indication of the era, but here it is, nonetheless: - 1986 and through the swaying, clutching, sweating dancers to the bathroom
Through the door to the usual - - Several boys are here, bow ties undone - unclipped in most cases
Smoking, drinking from whatever inventive container was used to smuggle in booze
Breath freshener and Visine are the chaser
Some of the guys are rolling joints while others make the sad effort to wave smoke away
Who are they kidding
It's a fog in here
to one in particular
Here we find    standing in front of mirror, clearly holding himself up from the effect of God knows what
He talks to his friend in the he stall behind him
Man, what's the matter with you
His friend is on the toilet with his head in his hands
He seems to be in some pain
He is   - 17
(contid) Dude
Lighten up
She's just a girl
You just gotta- No, my eyes
my eyes are killing me
The Freckled kid offers a small plastic bottle
You want some Visine, man
My
eyes
The freckled kid looks and sees that Scott's eyes are watering so badly that tears are literally streaming through his fingers
He goes back to the mirror to look at his own
they're burning
The freckled kid turns back to him
Dude, how much did you smoke
didn't smoke anything
Scott looks up, taking his hands away, revealing for an instant that his eyes are merely bright red embers in his head
Featureless but for the color
Freckles takes a step back
-    - blinding flash of light shows through the frosted glass in the double door and cuts through the crack into the dark of the gym
All who see it are stunned
Frozen
lingering moment of confusion, then: , the doors to the Boys Room burst open and the occupants scatter into the gym
-  - Freckles is still there, legs locked
'
He looks at Scott who is now crying meekly in the stall, covering his eyes again -- afraid to open them
The door of the stall across from him swings closed : ,      framing Scott's face perfectly
Pull back to reveal that the hole continues through the wall, into the girl's bathroom next door
In the corner several girls huddle together, they are afraid
- Packed with reporters and photographers
There's a dais - a raised panel of senators - and a second, lower panel
This is where the "experts" are testifying
Panning across the faces of several
creeps as they watch something with varying degrees of interest
: - woman's voice holds over the proceedings
It is the voice of   - whom we will soon meet
As she is speaking, we come to a large screen television at one end of the room
(
) In every organism on Earth there exists a mutator gene - the -factor, as it has come to be known
It is the basic building block of evolution - the reason we have evolved from homo habilus
Accompanying it is a  with a indicating the ascent of the "human being" as we know it
Accompanying the graph are evolving images of the "evolution of man
" (
) (contid) to homo erectus, to homo sapiens Neanderthals, and, finally, to homo sapiens
The animated demo on the screen zooms in on the lowest order of human depicted - homo habilus - a primitive, ape- like humanoid covered in hair
As he is singled out, the terrain of his time appears, along with the harsh signs of his winter
(
) (contid) Taking it's cues from the climate, terrain, various sources of nourishment, the mutator gene tells the body when it needs to change to adapt to a new environment
The process is subtle, normally taking thousands of years
As the graphic changes and depicts  , the '  - gradually evolving into the human we now know as ourselves
Now the terrain is modern, the weather pleasant
The image pulls back and places this man back in line at the front of evolution
(
) (contid) Only in the last few thousand years did mankind begin to make clothes for himself, build shelters, use heat and grow food in large quantities
With this man-made environment remaining relatively stable, the -factor became dormant
: early huts, early clothing; then early homes, later homes, air conditioning, cars, modern high- rises, etc
(
) (contid) Until now
On the room, the reactions, and on  herself
strong, attractive woman in her early 30's
simple placard before her: The screen shows the words " ," where the "evolution line" has resumed its rise
(contid) For reasons still not known to us, we are seeing what some are calling the beginnings of another stage of evolution - interrupts
Bearing down is the flamboyant   "" , a conservative from Florida, and the hearing's Chairman
Just behind him sits his aide   - mid 30's, typical government cog
You're avoiding the question  posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms
Grey
Three words: Are mutants dangerous
am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator
The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous
Another  ( ) speaks into her microphone: Well, we do license people to drive
But not to live
Kelly raises a hand, continuing his tirade
Ms
Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York
Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants
Math
History
Science
English
Athletics -- You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to -- Control, Senator
we teach them control
Kelly raises a blown-up photograph: a grainy, super- zoomed, somewhat obscured image of a which appears to have "melted
"  Now he's really playing to the crowd
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him don't know where you come from, Ms
Grey, but where  come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off
You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger
(laughs from the crowd) But what you presume to tell this committee - presume nothing,  am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet
Perhaps even your children, Senator
can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes
The room
Kelly mistaken thinks it is for him, until the double meaning occurs to him
He is momentarily embarrassed, but he quickly recovers
(contid) Ms
Grey, we are not here to weed out mutants
The Registration Act is designed merely to assess their potential threat - if any - to national security
The crowd reacts loudly in support of the Senator
Some cheer, some roar, some yell obscenities at Jean
Jean stands and walks out, pushing her way through reporters now moving in for her response
All the while, Kelly is delivering his last words
(contid) Mutants are very real
They are among us
We must know who they are
And above all, we must know what they can do
: -
- An angry mob outside the Senate hearing
Voices roar in dissent when Jean emerges, coming down the steps without hesitation
She sees signs condemning mutants, a scarce few supporting them
group of reporters are behind her and more meet her in front, closing her in
Microphones are shove in her face
/ Dr
Grey, how do you feel about the Senator's Statement / How is the mutant community reacting
Is it true that mutants are dangerous
/ Is there a mutant plot to overthrow the government
She ignores them all, trying to push through
: holding a full can of Coke
Smiling to his friend beside him
He fires it over the heads of everyone toward Jean
Perfect trajectory
Closing fast
Suddenly: Silence falls over the crowd
total silence
An absolute silence
All eyes watch in awe at the can and its liquid trail, frozen in mid-air a few inches from Jean's face
It simply hovers there
Weire not the ones to be afraid of
Using telekinesis she slowly lowers the can to the ground
She shakes her head, almost ashamed of the display
Almost as if to say iI didnit want to do that
i The can rolls down the steps
People move away from it as though the can itself were dangerous
The crowd steps back in genuine fear
Jean simply moves ahead now, unimpeded, still shaking her head
- Smoke curling from the chimney, warm light emanating from the window
well-worn pick-up truck parked axles deep in the snow, the back filled with a cord of cut wood
hand painted scrawl on the door reads: Firewood for Sales slope, just behind the cabin leading to a frozen lake
Ten beers sit cooling in the snow outside the door
We hear  ZEPPELINiS iBLACK
i - Music thunders, quite a contrast to the surroundings cosy little abode, showing signs of neglect, as though decorated with a gentler touch that passed not too long ago
large shelf replete with books
An electric mix from Sun Tsuis The Art of War to Mark Twainis The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
fire burns in the fireplace
On the mantle sit a few old black and white photos of a slightly younger Logan posing with a group of -   in a heavily wooded area
We can not tell if they are true Military or simply mercenaries
In the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful woman
And finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting at the only table in the center of the room
His back is to us
His hair is coarse and black, sprouting wildly from his head
He is
We will come to know him well
As well as we can
Despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the meticulousness of a watch maker
At the same time, he smokes a thick cigar
tall bottle of beer on the floor next to his chair
,    hangs from his neck from a battered chain
As we get closer, we look over his shoulder and see what he is working on so intensely
Pencil rubs against paper furiously
He is sketching, what we cannot see
But he is definitely caught up in his own minds eye
He listens to something we cannot begin to hear
momentary pause, and he goes back to sketching
Just as he seems to be settling back into the details again
He reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the box beside him
He listens
He stands, turning around slowly in a circle
He drops the sketch pad on the chair
Only the crackle of logs in the fire
LOGANiS
We follow his gaze around the room
Past the fire which sounds suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock which ticks as loud as clapping hands, past the simmering tea-kettle which hisses like a seething cauldron
Finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear crackling nearly as loud as the fire
Loganis senses are amplified many times more then ours, he walks to the door
His nostrils flare
He raises his fist beside his face
For a moment, it seems as if he is just chinking
Then --  - some nine inches long, emerge inexplicably from the skin just above Loganis knuckles
Logan barley turns his head before
, letting in freezing wind and billowing snow
Logan is hit from behind
The attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out the attacker
Whatever it is, it is
We can hear it snarling and see flashes of its claws as it slams Logan back
- The front door
The two combatants roll madly down the hill obscured by flying snow
Finally, we see Logan separate from his attacker and of the frozen lake
-   -  lifts into frame the hanging from it
The tagis chain slides off and too the ground
Logan struggles, already short of breath
As he struggles -- water starts to fill his lungs
His skin goes pale
He is drowning
- We hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for Logan
It stalks across the ice, searching
We catch a glimpse of shoulder, a  , a
Loganis struggle has decreased somewhat as his strength wanes
The ice above Logan shatters as a clawed hand reaches through
- violent
The ice gives way to the soaked and half- frozen Logan
The creature picks Logan up by his face, into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll
The two are face to face
This is called
The reasons are obvious
Teeth like said animal and catis eyes to match
mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the extreme
And then it speaks
Itis not gonna be that easy
Logan, half-drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at Sabretooth as though heis going to say something
Instead, a -   comes shooting out
With that, Sabretooth , as he hoists Logan up and throws him
Logan flies nearly ten yards
He lands head first
Sabretooth skulks over to him
With the sound of Sabretoothis breathing comes the rising of the wind
Snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold air
Sabretooth is nearly upon Logan now and the wind rises further, until he must shield his eyes from the bitter icy air
As he approaches, we see a fresh cut on Loganis face , leaving not so much as a scratch
: Lightning
No
Lightning is not red
Sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at Loganis motionless body
Then to his feet where a hole in the ice sprouts bubbling water
The wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two figures standing only a few yards away - mere silhouettes in the icy haze
closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, of form-fitting material - the man wears a reflective visor that hides his eyes
The womanis face is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual white hair
- one that seems to come from the manis visor itself
An intense beam of red light
Sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has broken away
He plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival dunking tank
His massive weight and hairy coat quickly suck him down
The   -  (Scott Summers) (Ororo Munroe) - obviously two of the children we saw earlier now grown - move over the hole and calmly watch Sabretooth gather himself and swim back to the surface
Storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense gaze
The wind whips further and the water in the hole begins to freeze over
Sabretooth wisely concedes
With one last look at the two mysterious figures now nearly obscured by the ice, he turns his body and swims away with the same agility he had on land
Cyclops and Storm walk over to Logan and look down at him curiously
LOGANiS
They look at one another, wondering
Above them, a black shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of jet engines
This is the - and it is like no other plane we have seen before
Loganis eyes begin to close as they obscure the last of all perceptible detail
- : The Periodic Table of Elements
chart made up of blocks depicting the elements and their chemical symbols
Among the standards like Gold (Au) and Iron () and Oxygen (O2) is a new square on simple red construction paper tacked to the top
It contains simply a large letter iA
i : We are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any we have ever seen -- and so are its occupants
, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name Across the room,  , a wiry redhead whose ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him the name
In the corner we see , no explanation needed, devouring a  of cereal, preariously balanced on his huge belly
They are a bestial and sinister bunch
Toad and Pyro are working on: fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in this lab
It is meticulously designed, and with its intricate circuitry, wires, and power boards, it resembles most closely (and only resembles, because truly itis like nothing weive ever seen before) a combination of an upright torpedo and a fantastic light source -- only far more dark and foreboding
Pyro holds a stick of solder in one hand
He lights a lighter with the other, then drops it
Strange thing -- the flame remains hovering about his finger
Quickly the flame intensifies and turns blue, melting the solder over a small circuit board
Then, the flame is gone
He sticks out his hand like a surgeon
Hand me the dykes
Toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and grabs a pair of pliers which he rests in Pyrois hand, leaving them slicked with
The flame in his finger goes out
The slimy coat over the pliers quickly , freezing their action
(contid) asked you not to do that
Blob laughs
Toad shrugs
In the background, almost ignored by them, something is on the television
The news
(
) Preparations are nearly completed for the upcoming anniversary gala celebrating the formation of the United Nations
With nearly every invitation confirmed, the occasion promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history
The image in the screen is a helicopter shot of , with Liberty Island and the famous Statue in the background
(contid) Ellis Island, once an arrival point for thousands of immigrants crossing the Atlantic with the hopes of a better life, will open its doors again
Only this time it will be to leaders and their families from over 200 nations
Blob belches his skepticism deafeningly
as the Newscast drones on
/ - through subterranean corridors and past dozens of projects that share some similarity to the machine we have seen, including crude designs that have been rejected or stripped of their good ideas
we become aware of a clicking sound
Almost like a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder
The newscast has faded and another voice is getting closer from somewhere down the hall
Sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us, turning just as we get to him
The clicking is loud and clear now
Sabretooth enters an office and we follow him
Seated at a desk in the center of the room is   - age - somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his years
He is more often called
The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum thingy on his desk
The six steel balls hang onto one another from string supports in formation depending on how many are let to fly from either end
One ball strikes one and one ball swings out from the other
Two balls and two, and so on
Slight difference
There are no strings supporting the balls, thus defying gravity
chess set - all of its pieces made of beautifully crafted iron - sits on the far end of the desk
He is watching television, or more accurately listening - his eyes looking off into space, deep in thought
and the leading voice in the call for Mutant registration is Senator Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who claims to support the constitutional rights of the genetically enhanced, but whose crusade to register mutants is gaining popularity
Now Kelly is on the screen
Magneto shakes his head
Not this one again
When Sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls instantly freeze and hover there
The volume on the television drops, though no remote is in sight
Magneto notices Sabretoothis apparent exhaustion, his torn clothing, including the slashes in his side
His look asks iwhat happened
i Sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog tag on the table
The one he ripped from Loganis neck
He sits at the desk, puzzling over it
(contid) Your expression tells me the news is not good, brother
lost him
How
It was Xavieris people
They knew
Frustrated
Magneto inspects the dog tag
want him
That is all they know because that is all you know
Nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag, weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, Canadian Military, Loganis name, rank, and a faded serial number
His thumb feels the indention of the word at the bottom of the tag that does not seem to fit here
We hear the voice of Senator Kelly on the
Kelly is on the screen giving good face
As he turns up the television, and again, we donit see how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking
think the Presidentis pre-occupation with international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem
Americanis deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants
To be taught by mutants
They also have the right to know the dangers
Thatis the purpose of registration
And mark my words, if the President isnit strong enough to do what needs to be done
As the Senator continues we   and see Magneto watching this
He begins speaking over Kellyis diatribe
And you may mark my words, Senator Kelly
All your plotting, all your hatred
have plans for you
Iive seen you come, and  will see you go
As Magneto turns Loganis dog tag between his fingers, we canit help but notice He then drops the dog tag on the desk, Magneto stands and heads for the door, Sabretooth follows
The television shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning someone to follow
Or some thing
He stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and waves again
paper clip just next to the dog tag skips off the desk and into Magnetois hand
He drops it, annoyed and tries again
slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag were held down by an unimaginable weight
He walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it, then trying to bend it
Nothing
(contid) Can it be
He puts it back on the desk
Now Magneto concentrates - sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air around it
The tag trembles, but does not budge
He looks at Sabretooth and smiles
Is that what youire looking for
piece
Only a piece
Is it enough
Enough for a test
And as Magneto looks up at Kelly on the television we: on the wall beside him
To a periodic table, smaller than the first
But still with that red square and added letter iAi
-   - Kelly and Guyrich walk out of the White House on their way to their limousine
canit believe the President canit see it
wouldnit be surprised if he has a mutant on his staff
Kelly and Guyrich climb into the limo and slump back in their seats
- Have you thought of a demonstration of some kind
Maybe use the  Summit to our advantage
The whole world will be watching
Iim not interested in the whole world, Henry
Iim interested in America
Let the rest of the world deal with mutants their own way
Where to
Kelly rubs his eyes
Home
Guyrich leans to address the driver
Dulles Airport
- Medical monitors beep, keeping track of the vital signs of -- Logan, who lies in a bed in the middle of a medical lab
In the wall beside Loganis bed is a light board on which hang Loganis -rays
Loganis skeleton seems to be more the creation of a Deco architect than of nature
Streamlined, refined
almost manufactured
He is asleep, recovering
Jean Grey enters the lab
She walks over and examines the -rays, fascinated by their unique structure
She notices what appears to be an unusually complex network of bones in the forearm
Jean looks down and runs her fingers over the traces of three incisions on the backs of Loganis hands
Jeanis eye moves across his body
His rippling muscles
Jean uncaps an  needle and moves to the middle of Loganis arm
We cannot help but notice a diamond ring on her left hand
Jean starts to put an  in Loganis arm
Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm Loganis hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off in his arm
He grabs a startled Jean by the throat
He is out of bed
She is unable to speak, choked silent by his grip
He places his fist near her face
We see the three faint scars just above his knuckles
Hesitation
Logan looks at her for a moment
Taken by her beauty
Then he is on his feet
Jean is on the floor, gasping for breath
Logan realizes something is missing
He reaches to his chest and feels for the dog tag
Gone
He stifles a curse
Where is it
He looks at Jean who recoils from him in terror
Logan thinks, then bolts
- Logan comes out into an empty hall
Strange
Deathly quiet
It is very sparse and modern, matching the lab we have just left
Logan runs and goes through the first door he comes to, to keep Jean from seeing where he has gone
- He looks around and sees he is in some sort of locker room
row of lockers run along one side of the wall
And hanging from the other side in a row, are , much like the ones Cyclops and Storm were wearing in the snow
He starts to rummage through the lockers, coming up with a shirt and pants that almost fit
pair of sneakers as well
He hears the sound of approaching foot-steps coming from the hallway
He spots another entrance on the far side of the room and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out, still in considerable pain
- Logan rushes through the door, looking behind to see if he has been seen
He closes the door and leans back to catch his breath
which stops momentarily as he looks around the massive hanger he has entered
The -Jet, the stealth plane we saw in Alaska, now sits parked and quiet
Logan walks to the plane and stops -- listening
We hear a strange
He listens for a second
The sound picks up in speed and we realize that we are listening to the      coming from above
As Logan tries to digest this, the door that he had just come through begins to open, letting in a shaft of light
Logan looks around wildly for a moment, looking for a place to hide when - An elevator door opens in the wall of the hanger ten feet from where Logan now stands
He whips around and runs for it
There is a button marked iG
i  He presses it
- The elevator opens on a hallway that doesnit match the rooms we have already seen at all
It is plush and stately, the hallway of a great mansion
He hears a voice coming from a room
As he gets closer to it, we can begin to hear: until the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity
With that one act, history was changed
The Christians who were once prosecuted and fed to the lions, became accepted
Now the voice is clear as a bell, coming from a room with the door slightly ajar
- Logan peeks in and sees in front of a chalk board, a massive blue furry creature called
Besides two arms and two legs, the only remotely human thing on his ape-like face is a pair of wire spectacles
He addresses a class of kids between the ages of 16 and 17
Besides the occasional physical alterations, there is an overall oddness to the group, giving way to the fact that in some way or another these are all mutants
So as their leaders went, so did follow the hearts and minds of the people of the Roman empire
Which made for some very happy Christians
Now he sees Logan standing in the door, looking back at him in mute shock
(contid) Can  help you
All the students turn to see Logan, standing in a hospital gown with a mean case of bed head
They start to giggle
Logan turns and heads down the hallway to the left
- Logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back down the hallway
He turns a corner, hugging the wall
He halts
large oak door stands down the hall
He smells something, taking in a deep breath, his head cocking to the side - listening
He turns and looks behind him
More foot steps
Someone is about to enter the hall
He turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees the  of two more people coming from the other direction
Logan is trapped
He lunges for the large oak door and bursts through
XAVIERiS  - Logan shuts the door and leans his head back against it, exhausted
(
) Good morning, Logan
Logan, still clutching his stolen clothes, opens his eyes and sees a man sitting behind a large mahogany desk -- , an intense and intelligent man just to look at him
Would you like some breakfast
Logan, who was prepared for anything but this, just stares
(contid) Iim sorry, allow me to formally introduce myself --  am Professor Charles Xavier
This is my school
How do you know my name
Xavier taps the side of his head with his finger
Youire not the only one with gifts
When he speaks, his lips do not move
We realize Logan ihearsi the voice in his head
In addition, the voice is accompanied by the indicating that perhaps Xavier had herded Logan through the mansion with his mind
He does not like it
Xavier comes out from behind his desk
We see that he is in a
Realizing that he is safe for the moment, Logan begins putting on his stolen clothes
What am  doing here
brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto
Who
very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you
Iim not sure why, but until we find out,  must ask you to stay
Logan looks Xavier over
He is obviously a kind man who is offering his help
Logan is silent for a moment
No thanks
Logan goes to the door
Xavier, disappointed, just watches him go
- Logan sees a grand entrance with two huge oak doors and brightly-polished steel knobs that scream iexit
i  He starts in that direction when the doors begin to open
moment of traffic, laughing, chatter
then they are all gone
He gets to the doors and pushes them open
Bright white sunlight floods in, nearly blinding him
- The first thing he sees through the haze is wings - ,
young boy, no more than fourteen, has them sprouting from his back
He is stretching not only his limbs, but his unusual appendages in the morning breeze
Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this shambling ruin of a man in the doorway
Off Loganis expression, we hear the flapping of wings and see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky
This only holds his attention for a moment
Logan looks across an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion high, wrought-iron gate surrounds the entire property
He watches as several children play basketball across a large court
Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door
Xavier simply watches from his window
-   - Logan heads for the gate
-- Logan pops his claws
Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave
He pauses, momentarily confused
He takes one long look back at the mansion
And then leaves
Stay for a moment
Watch him go
Then pan across a sign which reads -- XAVIERiS Westchester
slowly across the road to the thick woods on the other side of the street
in the trees, catching our eye
Someone is watching
It is Toad, camouflaged amidst the trees and branches
- helicopter streaks across the sky
- Kelly sleeps fitfully in the large seat
bump of turbulence
He wakes suddenly and looks out the window seeing the ocean below
Kelly looks out the window again and sees water
They are flying low
He looks at Guyrich, who sleeps as well
He wakes him
Where the hell are we
Guyrich looks out the window and looks at Kelly, puzzled
He stands and goes to the door to the cabin of the helicopter
Pilot
No answer
Guyrich tries to open the door
Itis locked
(contid) Pilot
Kelly looks out the window now and sees the helicopter is closing in on an island - where, is anyoneis guess
What is known is that the place is no pleasure resort
It is in fact some sort of refurbished island fortress, complete with turrets, built right into the side of the cliffs
- clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base of a rocky rise
The helicopter touches down
, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing Kelly and Guyrich to the intense wind of the rotors
They cover their eyes, cowering
KELLYiS
Two figures come out of a hole in the mountain
One seems extremely larger than the other
Guyrich and Kelly step out
As they get closer he can make out Magneto and Sabretooth
Dear God
Dear
God
The Pilot removes his helmet to : Pyro, smiling
(contid) What the hell is this
Kelly is utterly confused
As Magneto nears, Guyrich steps forward to greet him, putting arms around Magnetois neck and kissing him deeply
Then Magneto looks deep and lovingly into Guyrichis eyes
And with that    into a beautiful woman who herefore will be known as
Her body is covered in iridescent blue scales, which complement her lovely, solid yellow eyes
Kelly, of course, is shocked
Mystique shows a little hip, raising the scales at her mid-section mockingly, as the last of what we thought was Guyrich slips underneath
You
wha
Who are you
Where is Henry
Mr
Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator
You mutant bastards
Pyro grabs the Senator as he runs back for the helicopter in vain
Whatever you do to me
no matter what youill make me right
Every word have spoken will be confirmed
Gosh,  hope so
As Kelly struggles against all hope
People like you are the reason people like me exist
And with that, Mystique walks up
And people like you are the reason was afraid to go to school as a child
With that, Mystique punches Kelly
Knocking him out cold
- MAGNETOiS  - Kelly comes to
Magneto walks past him, holding Loganis dog tag
His thumb crushes one last time over the curious iWolverine
i : Kelly is strapped to a metal chair, bound impossibly tight
He struggles
Mystique watches from the far side of the room
Are you a iGod-fearing man,i Senator
Kellyis reaction tells him he is certainly afraid of something right now
(contid) That term always confused me
As if there were something to fear
Kelly looks around wildly, terrified
(contid) God after all, is often defined as all- forgiving
description  rather like
think what you really are afraid of
Magneto uses his mind to move Kellyis chair a little closer
Kelly nearly loses it
(contid) Is me and my kind
The Brotherhood of Mutants
He touches Kellyis face and Kelly recoils
(contid) And this law
Your mutant registration act is only the beginning
The intention of registration act - Intention, Senator
We are talking about mankind here
His fear
It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps
Studied for weaknesses
And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth
Kelly shakes his head
There is nothing he can say to sway this man
Magneto turns and admires his machine
(contid) Well, weire much more giving than that
We simply want to share with you
To help you understand
What is it you intend to do to me
(smiling) Letis just say, God works too slowly
Magneto moves to the machine
(contid) Youire a leader, Senator Kelly -- you set an example
And if more of you
were like more of us
Well, youill see
Kelly watches as Magneto takes Loganis dog tag and places it atop a tube at the bottom of a large spire in the center of the room some thirty feet high
He walks toward the opposite side of the room and watches as the tag is raised to the top of the device, through the shaft
(contid) Donit fear God, Senator
And certainly - most certainly
donit fear me
beat
(contid) Not any more
: raises his arms and a series of metal rings up from the machine platform that holds the dog tag
With a slight motion of his hand, the rings begin to spin slowly gaining in speed as Magneto controls it with his power
The air around it ripples, gaining in intensity
from Magnetois hands toward the machine
Now, Magneto has the rings spinning around the dog tag at such speed, the rings themselves are no longer visible - merely a blur around the stationary tag
Magneto lowers his hands
The machine is now working on its own
Kellyis eyes grow wide with fear as the metal dog tag begins to glow
Dull at first
the brightly
too brightly
The deafening whine of the machine builds louder and louder
Suddenly -- The sphere vanishes, enveloped in a light so white, it defies description
But Iill try: light that seems to ooze rather than radiate
light that fills the room as it expands outward and engulfs everything in sight
It is liquid light
Creeping and unstoppable
From outside the room, Pyro and Sabretooth watch through the window
It comes through, first casting its shadows darkly against the wall, then erasing them as it swallows them -  as though they were never there
- From under a door, the light leaks in, filling the room
All through the lair, air vents, keyholes, drainpipes and the like, the liquid light fills the lair to the gills
MAGNETOiS  - , the light beams up into the night sky, shinning like a beacon for miles
Then the white light obscures all
Fueled by this tiny piece of metal, the light extends like an ever growing bubble, out and up over the ocean
The bubble of white light is easily five miles across
- Kelly grits his teeth, barely visible in the whiteness
Then it is gone
He hangs his head in exhaustion
Magneto himself is a bit overwhelmed
He looks at his own skin - no apparent change
He shakes his head, blinks his eyes
Sabretooth and Pyro are also a bit struck by the display and they also seem a bit dazed
Magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming metal device
His hand comes out holding the dog tag - actually its remains
frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent
Nothing more
And this turns to dust in his fingers
Magneto has amazed even himself this time
The silence is shattered by a phone ringing
Sabretooth picks it up
He listens, then hands the phone to Magneto
Weive found him
Magneto puts the phone to his ear
He smiles
Where
on Kelly, his skin glistening slightly, almost luminescent
Pinker (healthier
) then it was when he came in
Oh
Oh God
what have you done to me
Magneto hangs up the phone
He crosses to Kelly, leans in and whispers in his ear
Welcome to the future
brother
Magneto stands, looks at his machine, then back at Kelly
(contid) Now if youill excuse me
have a train to catch
- The silver Amtrack moves speedily through the dark countryside
- makes his way through a half filled car of commuters taking tickets
He passes a restroom and exits the car
He takes a seat
Logan emerges from the restroom, having avoided paying his fare
few seats in front of him, in a grouping of seats that face one another, sit four large guys, early twenties -- Theyire the guys from your college named Brad that used to get drunk and try to drown freshmen in the toilets
Weill call them  1, 2, 3, and 4
They are drinking from beer cans in paper bags
Across the aisle from them sits a lone oddly pretty twenty year old girl
Her name is  -- a dark-eyed and somewhat distant creature
From the shawl around her head to her boots, layers of odd clothing wrap every inch of her body, except her face and hands
She looks worn, it is the face of a runaway
Next to her, a dirty duffle bag
The Brads are staring at Rogue, making lewd comments about her
They have obviously been drinking for awhile
1 Hey
Rogue looks at him, then quickly looks away
1 (contid) Hey
Hey Iim talking to you
The Brads laugh amongst themselves at her reaction
2 (looking at her duffle bag) Where are you going
1 Awww
look guys sheis shy
3 Maybe thatis why sheis alone
Is that why youire alone
Brad 4, who is closest to Rogue, leans toward her
4 Iill keep you company
Rogue is silent and turns her back on him, trying to ignore him
4 (contid) Hey
Iim talking to you
Rogue continues to ignore him
This gets Brad 4 angry
The other Brads watch his failure and laugh
4 (contid) (louder) said Iim talking to you
: Logan, his ears picking up everything
Rogue looks down trying not to look at them
Brad 4 will not be ignored
He reaches out to the one place which is not covered by clothing that he can reach - - Rogueis hand lying at her side
4 (contid) (louder still) said
He grabs her hand
Suddenly, Brad 4is eyes open wide as if heis in shock, an instant later, he
Rogue reels back
Bradis 1, 2, and 3 stand up, they are angry
1 Hey, what did you do
Donit touch me
Rogue stands, frightened and confused
Brad blocks her in
3 Hey Brad, sheis a mutant
Rogue moves to get away, but Brad 1 shoves Rogue
Rogue falls to the floor of the train, right next to Loganis feet
Brad 1 moves toward her
Suddenly, Logan steps in front of Brad 1
How about you sit down and leave the kid alone, alright
1 Sheis a mutant
Yeah, well, nobodyis perfect
: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the rear of the train
1 (who is considerably larger than Logan) think you should take a seat little fella
He shoves Logan backward
Logan gathers himself
Brad 4 is very weak but regaining consciousness
Brads 2 and 3 stand to back their friend against Logan
Itis now three against one
All the passengers are watching -- Listen --  donit want any trouble
1 Well you got trouble
Brad 1 slams his fist into Loganis stomach
Logan grabs the manis fist and lifts him up and over, slamming him into the train floor
Brad 2 grabs a commuteris briefcase and smashes it on Loganis head
Bursting open, its contents fly everywhere
Logan turns
Brad 2 stares wide-eyed as the gash on Loganis head starts to heal
Suddenly, Brad 1 is up
He grabs Logan around the neck from behind
He holds Logan in his head lock while Brad 2 and 3 start punching  him in the stomach and face
Logan is taking quite a beating and naturally the entire train of people are doing nothing
: Loganis eyes, his pupils are getting smaller
His brow furrows like a wolf
low guttural
Suddenly rage -- Loganis feet kick out, his left foot strikes Brad 1 in the face knocking him backward, while his right foot hooks around Brad 2is head dragging him forward
With his left hand Logan grabs Brad 2 by the throat, squeezing the esophagus
Brad 2 is paralyzed
His eyes roll up as the oxygen is cut off
Brad 2 collapses
: Brad 3 running out of the car with the other passengers
pushes past the fleeing passengers, into the car
Brad 1 still bear hugs Logan from behind
Logan reaches pushing his knuckles against Brad 1is leg
Suddenly: -- the sound of metal extending
Brad 1 howls in pain
-- the sound of metal retracting
Brad 1 releases Logan and stares down at three punctured holes in his leg
Logan wheels around, kicks him to the floor, and punches him
All eyes in the train are on Logan, as he raises his fist
-- Logan extends his claws
Logan is at the peak of his rage
The passengers stare in disbelief
Even Rogue is astonished
Freeze
transit police
Drop your weapon
Logan pauses, only for a second
Brad 1 is wailing for his life
But rage has taken over
Logan raises his blades to finish what he started
Suddenly,
Logan goes flying backward
- The train has been brought to a sudden stop -- but the wheels are still turning
Finally, they are shut down
- The lights are out
Everyone gathers themselves
Then comes a low grinding creak
The sound of metal bending
Rivets popping
- Like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of the train car is peeled off
Revealing the terrified passengers inside -- and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique Toad and Pyro on the outside
With a final thrust, the air  and Magneto tosses the car wall to the side
Passengers from the other cars stare wide-eyed out their windows
The train has stopped at a railroad crossing, the gates are down
You can come out now, Logan
Youire among friends
The transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his pistol
Freeze
With a turn of his finger, Magneto draws the pistol to him
The cop holds tight and is yanked off the train, onto the ground
With another twist of his hand, Magneto makes the gun leap from the copis grasp and , pointing at the copis head
You Homo Sapiens and your guns
The gun cocks
(
) Thatis enough, Max
All turn to see Xavier, seated in his wheelchair -- flanked by Cyclops, Jean and Storm
All, save Xavier, are in uniform
: Storm, a
Iill never understand your regard for them, Charles
And Iill never understand terrorists
am trying to save our kind, Charles
You should do the same
Not at the cost of lives, Max
Xavieris metal chair is gripped by magnetic forces
It shakes and begins to inch towards Magneto
Magneto
The chair is pulled closer to Magneto
Cyclops steps forward
Xavier need not turn to know help is coming
Magneto sees and respects Cyclopsis power
The chair stops moving
(to Cyclops) Itis alright
itis alright
Magneto glances at Storm, then Cyclops
The two in Alaska
Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time
Still tinkering with Cerebro
(referring to Logan) What do you want with him
Magneto smiles now, tapping his
Canit read my mind
Xavieris expression falters
It appears as if the helmet has been made to block Xavier from doing just that
(contid) Iill tell you something, Charles, we are more alike now than we were when we started
Is that so
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind
Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max
What is it like these days
Letis just say that  am out to make some radical changes
Now come on Charles
For old times sake, for your sake
Leave him to me
Logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers
Sabretooth fighting the urge to move on him
Logan glares back at Sabretooth
(contid) Ahh
there you are brother believe you possess something  am very much in need of
Just then,    and punches Toad in the stomach, doubling him over
Oddly - Toad is laughing
He stands upright
Do it again
Another roar and another punch
Toad is crying and laughing at the same time
(contid) Oh God it hurts
Do it again
Magneto watches this, momentarily stunned
Suddenly, Pyro grabs hold of his face
IiM
And Mystique  into a small child and begins tugging at Magnetois pant leg
have to go to the bathroom
Magneto looks at the cause of it all: , ,    MAGNETOiS Cyclops cannot help laughing
Storm and Jean smile
Magneto is furious
If  could make you understand
If you could just be made to see it the way  do
The way itis going to be
The way what is going to be
Iim going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles
(Points to Logan) And this one gets a front row seat
What do you mean to do
And Magneto steps back a little further
His oddly behaving consorts follow
This checkmate goes to you
didnit want to hurt anyone
But you leave me no choice
Sabretooth and Toad walk away, still with the punching and asking to be punched
Magneto takes the little girl/Mystique by the hand and the blind Pyro by the arm and leads them away, humiliated, to their waiting helicopter
Xavier turns back to Logan, still standing in the train car, amidst all the huddled passengers
Suddenly, all the passengers except Rogue lay on the floor and seats and go to sleep
few of them even snore
(contid) Now will you come back with us
look crosses Loganis face
Uncomfortable
Look,  appreciate your concern
But, do better on my own
Xavier indicates the wreckage of the train
You got less than sixty miles today
Iill make you a deal
Two days
If we havenit figured out what Magneto wants with you by then
Iill bring you back myself
Logan looks up at Xavier suspiciously, hating that he is making sense
Xavier moves closer
Logan looks over at Rogue, covered in her layers of clothes
Storm is helping her off the train, yet taking care not to touch her skin
What are you going to do with her
Xavier looks to Rogue
warmth comes over his face
An look of understanding
At a glance he has read her mind
He knows her pain -- her struggle
Rogue looks to Xavier
Their eyes meet
Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an extraordinary power
One that even her own family isnit able to accept
Sheis been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home
place to belong
Xavier turns to Logan
(contid) -- Weire going to give her that
Logan looks at rogue, contemplating this
Then to Xavier
Forty-eight hours, old man
But if you cross me,  wonit feel any guilt about what  do to you
Deal
Logan eyes the rest of the gang until he settles his gaze on Jean
He offers a faint seductive smile
This is not lost on Cyclops
MAGNETOiS  -  -  - cell with bars, but no visible door
Kelly is hunched over his toilet, heaving
His suit is rumpled and dirty, showing signs that time has passed
There is a television just outside the door: We see    circling a platform built against the backdrop of the main entrance to Ellis Island
We see massive security measures, the likes of which have never been attempted, being prepared
(Voice plays over the rest of the scene) (
) Is there such a thing as too much security
possible complication adding to the United Nations Anniversary is the sheer number of security personnel for what will be the largest single summit in the history of the planet
He walks towards the cell and tries to look down the hall, pressing his face to the bars
(
CONTiD) While the Secret Service has never had difficulty handling one or even several world leaders, it has never had to handle the daunting task of watching over all of them
It is only then that he hears a slight crack and his head squeezes between the bars like a soft-shelled egg
He gasps in pain, but more from shock
He pulls his head back with some difficulty and , it squeezes right back through
What have you bastards done to me
Kelly is horrified
Disgusted
He paces the cell, unable to comprehend what has happened to himself
It is only when he hears the sound of a that he reacts
He starts to panic, then collects himself
Then he goes over to the bars again
He pauses, afraid
then: He pops his head through again
He turns his shoulder toward the bars and begins to push
His feet slip in the floor and his fingers stretch and crack inside, then his ribs begin to pop one by one with the brittleness of undercooked spaghetti
It is agonizing, but Kelly finally manages to pull his horribly-altered body through the bars
- Kellyis whole chest and pelvis are slightly flattened beneath his clothes, but with a hideous crunching sound, they seem to inflate again back to normal
Kelly looks at his body with a mixture of fascination and disgust
Kelly turns and screams
Blob has just walked into the room and lunges, grabbing him by the arms
Kelly is enveloped in this fat, hulking mass
He manages to keep one hand free and all he can do is push it against Blobis face
It is futile
Until
Steam begins to come off Blobis face
And Blob - Senator Kellyis helicopter, which has obviously been pilfered for Magnetois use, lands
Magneto, Sabretooth, Pyro, Mystique (no Toad) all climb out, having returned from their ill-fated attempt to get Logan
-  - Kelly peers down the hall where we first went on our way to meet Magneto
Kelly, with only that way to go, does so, passing once again the odd assortment of machines, very reminiscent of the one he was exposed to
He hears voices coming toward him and he looks around wildly, wondering what to do
Shadows foretell the arrival of the brotherhood headed this way
Kelly turns to run back from where he cam from
-  - Magneto and Sabretooth come walking from the other end of the hall and pass the very spot where we just saw Kelly
No sign of him
- From which Kelly has escaped
The bars bend to make room for Magneto as he walks into the room
How are we feeling today, Senator
Advanced,  hope
But he freezes when he actually enters the room
First, he sees that Blob is laying on the floor with a purple, welt-like hand print across his face
It is blistered and hideous
Blob is gasping for air
Magneto looks and sees the cell is empty
He looks at Sabretooth
(contid) want him alive
Iill find him
And Sabretooth bolts back from where they came
MAGNETOiS  - Kelly hits the fresh air, looking around wildly
He runs for the edge of a cliff high over the ocean
He raises his hands, we see his palms are covered with those wicked spines and they are dripping a venomous fluid not too different in color from the wound on Blobis face
But then suddenly, something is wrong
Kelly buckles, clutching his stomach again
He squelches what would have been a scream of agony
He looks at his palms and the spikes are gone
Kelly hears footsteps
Suddenly out of the darkness Sabretooth barrels toward him
Kelly turns and
Sabretooth comes to the edge of the cliff
When he looks over, Kellyis body has vanished
Swallowed by the sea
Only his clothes remain on the rocks below
LOGANiS  - Jean shows Logan the simple dorm cube with a bed and a small desk
Jean opens the door for Logan and he inspects the sparse surroundings grimly
Cyclops stands just outside the door - eavesdropping
Anything else  can get you
Some cigars
Case of beer
Thereis no smoking or drinking on the school grounds
wonit light the cigars - how about that
Iill see what  can do -- You should get some sleep
Even with your healing ability, youire going to be hurting for a while
What if  like the pain
Jean doesnit know what to make of that
She is about to leave, then pauses
The Professor said you were a solider
Actually,  believe he used the word mercenary
Yeah
Well  donit like to talk about my past
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that
By reading my thoughts
If necessary
(smirks) What if theyire naughty
Jean smiles politely at his knowing glance
Get some shut-eye, slick
She shuts the door
- Jean hesitates at the door, thinking
Smiling
She turns and only then does she realize Cyclops is standing there
She is startled
Scott
- donit like him being here
What are you talking about
You saw what happened tonight
You think Magneto wonit come after him again
You think he wonit come here if necessary
This is a school, for Godis sake
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose itis our responsibility to do something
Cyclops shakes his head
(contid) Whatis wrong
Thereis something else bothering you
Cyclops gets closer to Jean
She puts her hand on his chest
have a bad feeling about this
Jean leans in slowly and kisses Cyclops just beside his mouth You know  love you, Scott
Cyclops pulls her close
The hold each other
LOGANiS  - Loganis ear
His super-sensitive hearing has picked up the whole conversation
Logan looks over on the bed and sees a new sketchbook and several pencils
small note is attached
hope you donit mind
understand this helps you relax
- Logan shakes his head
XAVIERiS  -  - white light board
Beastis blue furry hand slides a long, full-body x-ray in place
Beast is showing Loganis x-rays to Cyclops, Storm, Jean and Xavier
Adamantium
Until today  thought it to be a myth
Impenetrable, unbendable, resistant to the most extreme heat, cold, indestructible
Beast points to the x-ray
(') Itis been grafted to his entire skeleton
He also has accelerated healing abilities - uncharted regenerative capability, making his age impossible to determine
He could very well be older than  am
Is the Adamantium part of his mutation
No
Someone put it there, relying on his healing abilities to keep him alive
What do you think Magneto wants with him
Xavier wheels himself to the window, starring out, deep in thought
Iim not entirely sure itis ihimi that Magneto wants
: -ray of Loganis Adamantium skeleton
- Rogue
The waifish young thing who hides so well in the shadows seems more comfortable to be moving through the mansion at night
She passes through the halls and rooms not making a sound in her strangely-swathed body suit
LOGANiS  - She creaks a door open slowly, letting a shaft of dim light slice the darkness
The light shines across a nightstand
Rogue stares down at the notepad, a sketch it
It is of an animal, small but fierce - a wolverine
She walks in to a figure laying in the bed and stands over him
Over Logan
He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving quickly this way and that in
His hands twitch
Rogue leans closer
LOGANiS
- -   - Like none we have ever seen thus far
In fact, judging by most of the instruments here, we are looking at a laboratory some fifty years old
Logan looks down and we can see his body, naked, strapped to a table
hand puts a mask over his mouth and - He awakens - LOGANiS
He struggles weakly with restraints as doctors in lab coats and thick, red rubber gloves stand over him taking notes, paying very little attention to him at all
On the other side of the room is a huge vat filled with some kind of molten metal
At the base of the vat is a giant electromagnet generating a huge gyroscope which created enormous friction energy - the apparent source of the intense heat for melting the metal in the vat
: Awake again, but this time sinking into water - restrained completely now
Logan looks down and gets only a glance of his body, seeing that he is a series of incisions from head to toe - literally split open - the flesh held back with hundreds of clamps
- And the sound of a
Mixed with screams, it is unbearable
LOGANiS  - Loganis screaming as he comes to
Loganis eyes
He looks up and sees a figure looming over him
In a flash he reacts
Nothing more
Then silence
The door bursts open and Cyclops stands in the doorway shocked
Frozen
Jean is next and finally Storm
They can only stare
Logan sits upright in bed,  ,  ROGUEiS She is literally frozen at the end of his arm
Finally, Cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab her
DONiT
Cyclops freezes
Logan finally pulls his claws free and retracts them
Rogue staggers, she pitches forward and touches his face gently with her hands, as though she would like him to be the last thing she sees on this Earth
Logan and Rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness snaring a look of loneliness that only they can understand
But suddenly, Logan seems to change
And before he can say another word, he begins to tremble, then he starts to howl in pain
Rogue  , mouth open in a gaping, silent scream
What sound comes out does not match the expression at all
Merely a gasp, like steam escaping
Through the huge slash in her clothes, we see the wound on her chest slowly vanish
Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with no sign of injury
Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way Loganis did - too much like Loganis did
It is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage
Soon she is smashing things all around her
One hand rakes the wallpaper like claws
Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted Rogue we all know so well
Then she stands slowly, looks at the others
And she runs from the room
Storm runs after her
The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing
Jean goes to help him
She looks back at Cyclops
His expression makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass
- familiar scene of suburban escapism
Crowded enough that most people can move about unnoticed
In fact, most people do not notice the very large jellyfish shooting through the water at remarkable speed
And only a few notice the emerging from the water
It is Senator Kelly, and he resembles in many ways a jellyfish
His skin and innards are clear and gooey
It is only when he comes completely and naked out of the water that he returns to somewhat normal
He walks up to the beach and people recoil from the very sight of him
Pointing, whispering
Then just laughing at the naked man
Kelly grabs a towel off an empty chair, a Hawaiian shirt off another
Suddenly, he buckles, grabbing his stomach and lurching away in terrible pain
He barely pauses when he hears a childis voice in semi- whisper: CHILDiS Mom, is that a mutant
- Storm and Logan walk down the hall
Logan is wearing sweats
He has obviously just woken up
The sun is low in the horizon and the hall is suffused with an orange glow
Students pass by them
By now, the students have heard rumors about what happened the night before
They watch Logan fearfully as they pass by him
Why is everybody up at sunrise
The sun is setting, Logan
Youive been asleep for nineteen hours
What did she do to me
She borrowed your power to save her life
When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts
In your case -- your ability to heal
Thatis why she keeps her body covered
felt like she almost killed me
If she held on any longer she could have
And you think it helps calling her Rogue
Storm shakes her head, but remains patient
Weive learned to embrace what we are rather than hide it like an affliction
For some, it has become their identity
You mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride
They arrive at the door to the gym
Inspiring -- Now what am  doing here
(
) wanted to talk to you
Logan turns and sees Cyclops
(contid) Storm, would you excuse us please
Of course
She exits
Letis take a walk
Cyclops begins to walk away in the other direction
Logan just watches him go
After a moment, he decides it might be more interesting to see where this is going
He follows
They walk across the hall to: - On first glance, the gym looks really average
fairly standard boxing ring in the middle
fairly standard weight set nearby
Then you notice the weights themselves are abnormally large
100
200
300
400 pounds
All the way up to 2000
And that is just one stack
Cyclops enters first with Logan coming in behind him
How long have you been in Alaska
donit remember
Is that what you wanted to ask me
Logan is barely through the door when Cyclops whips around on Logan and thumps his finger into his chest
just wanted to make you clear on something
Personally,  donit care what Magneto wants with you
He can take those claws of yours and use them for Barbecue skewers
What  do care about is the safety of this group
The Professor is in charge, and after the Professor, thereis me
So, for the remainder of your time here, youire going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt
Beat
(smirks) Iive served with men like you before
Methodical
Systematic -- Naive
You know what happens to those men in a real fight
You know, you -- Shut up
got no interest in you, Xavier, (he points mockingly at the Xis on Cyclopsi uniform) or your
-Men
Logan takes him in for a moment
(contid) And  donit think this has anything to do with my ikiller instinct
i  You just donit like the way Iim looking at your girl -- Or maybe you donit like the way sheis looking back
And maybe you think youire man enough to do something about it
Cyclops is enraged
red light begins to glow around the edge of his visor and the ruby-quartz lens brightens
We can faintly hear the low hum of immense power that is now barely contained
Before Cyclops can even react, Logan puts his fist against Cyclopsi throat
Logan extends one claw up one side of Cyclopsi neck
He smiles
(contid) Cimon sport
You think you can blow the meat off my bones before  gut you
Letis find out
The air is now charged with tension
The two men are about to attack when- (
) Cyclops
Logan whirls and sees Xavier regarding them sternly
Logan turns his building anger on Xavier
have a question for you, Chuck
Whatis the point
Xavier sits calmly as Logan, claws still extended, marches over to him
The point of what
This
This whole God damn thing
(derisively, at Cyclops) Making yourselves into some sort of iteami of super-powered freaks
Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature
For what
Logan continues to advance on Xavier
Cyclops moves to stop Logan, but Xavier waves him off
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility
To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings
What if it never happens
What if theyire so afraid of us that we become the enemy
-- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery
Xavier has heard this argument before
Now thatis Magneto talking
No
Thatis me talking
And you know what
Itis only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me
believe he wants you for your Adamantium
Logan raises his hand to his chest grasping for something that no longer hangs from his neck
(contid) Youire thinking of your dog tag
It was made of Adamantium wasnit it
(
) Professor
Logan turns and sees Jean walking towards them
What is it
Rogueis missing
Logan looks at Jean with concern
- long, dark subterranean corridor with gleaming walls and floor
Well lit and strangely echoless
Logan follows Xavier, who are in turn followed by Storm, Cyclops and Jean to a thick steel door at the end of the hall
Where are we going
To find Rogue
How
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being
At Xavieris eye level is a black screen with a chin-rest like you see at the eye doctor
Xavier rests his head in it and the screen lights up
(contid) Cerebro amplifies my power
It allows me to browse the worldis consciousness and find the genetically enhanced
vertical beam scans across his eye and a picture of Xavieris retina appears on the screen next to a computerized image of the same
The two images overlap and match perfectly
(contid) This is how  found you
small beep and a loud  of tumblers rolling and the vault door opens
They walk inside
-  - They come into a room with a high sphered ceiling - entirely black
In the center of the room is a huge - for lack of a better term - device
Part computer, part super- structure, it is the sort of precision tangle of metal and wire that would make Da Vinci weep
It has a space in the bottom that seems to fit Xavier and his chair perfectly
Suspended above its center -- a web of wires, tubes, and cables all connecting to the heart of the device -- a
Logan slowly circles the device
Logan looks at Xavier, perhaps even a little impressed
You designed this yourself
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together
He helped you
We were friends once
But that was a long time ago
Jean, Logan, Cyclops and Storm watch as Xavier fits his wheelchair into the huge machine, and the chrome skull cap lowers onto the Professoris head, fitting like a second skin
It comes to life
What was dark and menacing is now a brilliant explosion of colored lights
: - into and through his eyes and: - Closing in rapidly on the planet Earth
Passing into its atmosphere, making a few orbits, all the while hearing the deafening voices of billions
Every country, every city, every town, berg, hamlet and village
Every language
Every thought
The voices descend to a sizeable crowd of millions, then thousands, gradually working their way to one
-   - Down a tree-lined road and around a corner into a parking lot
Single out a figure that - by the clothes - can only be Rogue
Close in faster and faster, lower and lower until we go right through the back of her head to: (
) donit belong
donit belong
Iim sorry
so sorry
thereis nowhere
- Xavieris eyes open
Iive found her, Westchester Mall
Iill go
No
Iill go
Logan looks over to Jean
sport
you go
- mother and child wander in a typical shopping daze
Crowds of shoppers mill about, a typical crowded evening at the mall
Rogue comes up the escalator, wandering through them all
She walks under a high-sphered glass ceiling, revealing the night sky outside
She walks over to a Victoriais Secret store and looks up at the mannequins in the windows who wear almost nothing at all
Quite a contrast from her own, stifling garb
She touches the glass as though trying to reach them, then she moves on
ROGUEiS
She looks all around the mall at the many oblivious people here
Children playing tag on one side
young couple holding hands
Human contact all around
She walks past a small child, her hand nearly brushing the girlis hair
Rogue takes a seat on a bench, alone
figure comes into frame
Rogue
Rogue looks up and sees Storm standing right in front of her
Her eyes dart around, looking for a way out
(contid) You donit have to run
Finally, Rogue surrenders
Iim sorry
Iim not like the rest of you -- Iim tired of hurting people
She starts to cry now
Itis okay
Why did  have to be like this
What purpose does it serve
And when Rogue looks up, she sees another figure - this one filling the frame behind Storm
huge clawed hand grabs Storm around the throat and lifts her up as she struggles in vain
-   - Cyclops looks up and sees Storm is being , her feet not touching the ground
Rogue is frozen with fear
He tries to get a shot with his visor, but too many people are in the way
-   - Sabretooth smiles as Storm struggles to turn
He whispers in her ear
Scream for me
: STORMiS  as the life is being squeezed out of her
XAVIERiS  - XAVIERiS Suddenly, Xavier touches his throat, then raises a shaking hand to his head
Dear God
Xavier wheels himself from the room
-   - Cyclops has a clear shot now
His eyes start to glow brightly
Suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him
Toad has been camouflaged the entire time
He comes down and   - , snatching the visor from Cyclopsi face
Deep red light far greater than anything we have ever seen before comes blasting out of cyclopsi eyes without any sort of control, as if a fire hydrant had been ripped from the ground
His head comes back and the light blows the whole of the glass ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on panicking shoppers who scatter
Toad leaps to the second level and then again out of sight
-   - Sabretooth reacts, surprised by the sudden shift
This gives Storm one last chance to breath
We notice now that something is happening to her body
-   - Cyclops stumbles helpless, his eyes are shut to prevent further destruction
-   - Storm, nearly lifeless now, struggles with what little strength she has to get free of Sabretooth
He relishes the slow kill
But suddenly
Sabretooth is momentarily confused
Stormis eyes open wide as her body convulses
huge bolt of lightning shoot from her body into Sabretoothis chest, knocking him back in shock
Storm falls to the ground, not breathing
Sabretooth, stunned and scorched, gets to his feet and smiles at his handiwork
He is about to move in and finish them both when the rumble of a helicopter can be heard above
He looks up and sees  KELLYiS  passing over the hold in the roof
Sabretooth leaps up and pulls himself out of the opening
Toad is a leap behind
Rogue rushes to Storm, struggling with how to give her mouth to mouth, , anything to resuscitate her without touching
She is starting to panic now
She looks around, but anyone still left in the mall is running for the doors
SHEiS
-   - Cyclops stumbles blind and helpless, covering his eyes
He hears Rogue screaming
(
) ISNiT
Cyclops tries to find a way up, but he trips over all the debris, helpless
CANiT - Xavier is in a specially designed car that enables him to drive solely with his hands
He races towards the mall
-   - Rogue is talking, walking backwards towards Storm, trying her best not to lay a hand on Cyclops
Here, here, here
a little left
Careful
: Cyclops drops to his knees, the sprinklers still gushing
His eyes are tightly shut
He feels for Stormis face and touches her lips
Oh God
He immediately begins mouth to mouth, though it may have been too long
- Xavier fights the rush of traffic - people fleeing madly from the mall
As he pulls up to the front doors, he sees Cyclops emerging, carrying Storm
She is conscious, but her breathing is shallow
His eyes are shut tightly and he must follow Rogueis direction
Sirens wail in the distance
Xavier looks at the lot of them: waifish Rogue, blind Cyclops, unconscious Storm and his wheelchair-bound self as their guardian
But why would they do this
Then a look of realization
-  - Rogue hurries past several students
She runs up to the large front doors of the school, but they are locked
She looks around and then runs toward the side of the building
- Beast, continuing his research into Magnetois plan, is analyzing the x-rays of Loganis skeleton
Several books about metallurgy are scattered across the table
LOGANiS  - Logan is sketching quietly
He chews a cigar, keeping it politely unlit
He hears something
He stands, goes to the door and opens it
He cocks his head
listening
smiling
We hear it too, sharing his ears
It is a woman breathing, groaning
He smiles and follows the noise
- Rogue climbs through a studentis open window
- She darts down a hallway and around a corner, looking around, staying low
- Jean is working out on an average-sized set of free- weights, sweating, pushing hard
Obviously the sound Logan heard
She is on her back doing presses
Suddenly, she looks up and sees Logan standing over
She is startled and starts to drop the bar
He catches it
You should always work with a spotter
Heis busy right now
Logan cannot help but glance at her left hand, still clinging to the bar
The shimmering diamond on the third finger
was thinking maybe you and me could go into town
Were you now
What do you say
Not interested
Logan shrugs, starts to take his hands away
Jean is not ready to take the weight of the bar
It almost comes down on her when he catches it again
Let go
Suit yourself
And he does
And so does Jean at the same time
She gets up and faces Logan - the bar simply hovers in mid- air
Logan smiles
- Beast looks at his watch
Itis stopped
He puts it to his ear -- shakes it
Then his ears perk up
He hears something
He glances at the wall
All things  -- picture frames, chairs, objects on tables, etc
start to move one after the other
It is as if some magnetic force is moving past the wall, just outside the lab, heading for the open door
Beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal door
Just as he reaches it, it  closed -- knocking him back across the room
Beast  into the wall on the opposite side of the lab
His leg badly hurt, Beast tries to crawl toward the door
But as he does this,   from around the lab fly in front of it sealing him in
- Rogue moves quietly down the corridor that leads to Cerebro
She comes to the retinal scanner - she brings her eye to the screen
It lights up and scans her eye
XAVIERiS appears on the screen
beneath it: The scanner scans again
ROGUEiS Something is wrong
The eye not being scanned is a familiar yellow
It is Mystique
Her other eye changes in the light of the scanner
The retina reshaping itself in minute ways
:  The screen --   -- The door to Cerebro opens
Rogue or rather Mystique, rushes in
She goes to a small panel on the side of Cerebro
She opens it
She reaches in -- No more than three inches wide
- :  The black boots of a man, walk down a hallway, as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified
- Jean is casually wiping sweat from her brow
Loganis eyes possess a certain focus intent
Heis uptight
He takes his work seriously
He takes himself seriously
What is it youire failing to get at
Are you interested in me
Iim just interested
Holding out her left hand
Logan, do you see this ring
Iive seen a lot of rings
Yeah, Iill bet you have
Before he can reply, Rogue is standing in the doorway looking at them
Rogue, where have you been
Logan
The Professor wants you to come with me right away
on Loganis nose
His nostrils flare
sensing
Logan squints the tiniest bit
We know he knows something is wrong, but he is hiding it
(to Rogue) Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were telling me last night
Rogue pauses
Confused
The Professor-- Logan walks towards her
You remember
About women
He moves closer
Logan-- Whatever you say about them being the same
The claws are out
(contid) No two women smell alike
He grabs Rogue by the throat
Logan, what are you doing
Jean, seeing Logan threaten Rogue with his claws for the second time,
This ainit Rogue
He keeps his claws pointed at her face
: Loganis left hand is wrapped around Rogueis throat but part of it is Jean realizes that Logan is right (
) Telekinesis
Jean spins around and sees
Without hesitation, the vaulting horse
Simultaneously, one of the thousand-pound weights flies from the weight set and smashes the vaulting horse aside
(contid) Fascinating
What  wouldnit give for that
Alas, metal is all Iim good for
But it seems to serve me well enough
Jean is completely unaware of the huge set of lockers rising behind her
Jean
The lockers hit her in the back, sending her flying
Jean lies motionless on the floor, unconscious
The heavy lockers are floating above her, wavering between a few feet and a few inches
do love a good check mate
What do you want
Come with me and Iill let her live
You think  care about her
Iim the only one whois sure to walk out of here
Pause
Then why donit you kill her
This catches Logan a little off guard
(contid) Go on
Kill her
You can do it quicker than  will
Maybe Iill just cripple her
The lockers now stand upright, hovering over Jeanis knees
(contid) So do her the favor
Show her mercy
Logan thinks for a moment -- looks at Jean still unconscious on the floor
Then: Logan retracts his claws
Mystique has morphed back into her natural state with the exception of   ROGUEiS , which still clings to her hip
Mystique produces a large syringe from the pocket and sticks it in Loganis neck
Loganis legs weaken instantly
(contid) (to Mystique) Call the others and tell them we have what we came for
-  - The fence that surrounds the property has been bent and buckled violently
- Xavier wheels down the hallway, pajama clad students are milling about the halls
Their faces showing that they are afraid to go back to their rooms
One , younger and smaller than the others, seems particularly upset
Xavier wheels over to her and gently touches the side of her face
Itis going to be alright
She manages a faint smile
Then Xavier looks to the other students -- their frightened faces
-  - Beast reclines in his lab chair, a splint on his leg
Jean stands with Cyclops who watches through a new visor
Rogue sits off to the side, bearing the guilt
While Storm, her neck badly bruised, stands near her
For the first time we have seen -- Charles Xavier is angry
When Rogue left the mansion, they must have followed her
Xavier shuts his eyes furious
Yes
they wanted me out of the way
If  had been here
Xavier opens his eyes and sees Rogue sitting on a chair in the corner
She is visibly upset
Xavier wheels over to Rogue
Xavier reaches out and softly touches her clothing covered shoulder
(contid) This was not your fault
knew there was a danger,  should have never left the school
And with that he turns his wheelchair to the door
(contid) am going to find Logan
Xavier leaves
- Xavier enters and wheels himself into the giant machine
It immediately comes to life - lighting the room
The chrome skull cap descends onto Xavieris head
Xavier closes his eyes as the machine powers up
XAVIERiS They fly open
And then a terrible noise
The sound of a well tuned machine suddenly going horribly wrong
Xavier is in terrible pain
His back arches and he falls from his chair onto the floor
He struggles to reach for a fire alarm on the wall
His fingers stretch until finally -- he pulls it
Warning bells wail
Xavier falls unconscious, convulsing
: Cyclops and Jean as they burst into the room
-  - Xavier lies asleep in a hospital bed
Several electrodes are taped to his head
screen next to the bed monitors his erratic brain waves
Jean and the splinted Beast stare at the monitor following its rhythm
Storm and Rogue stand at the foot of the bed
They are each trying to hide their fear, and not doing a very good job of it
Cyclops looks on, the stress shows on his face
Whatis wrong with him
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker
Iim in the process of running more tests
But it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker
All are silent
Rogue looks to Beast with desperate eyes
Can you help him
donit know
Xavier lies in bed, motionless
- Two huge wooden front doors -- morning light shines through the jagged holes in the wood where the knobs had been pulled off
The antique steel knobs lay twisted and mangled on the floor
The small girl from last night kneels in front of the door with a dustpan, sweeping up the mess
Something catches her eye
She sits up and leans in closer to the jagged hole in the door
: The little girl -- light from the hole washes over her face
Then suddenly the light is cut off, as if something is blocking the hole
: as the small girl steps back, a look of fascination comes across her face
As if she sees something coming through the hole
- Cyclops, Jean and Storm stand before the device
Beast rises awkwardly on his splinted leg, his back to the open control panel
Itis gone
The neuro-filter, someone removed it
Jean stands
What does that mean
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professoris mind
Itis what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions
Cyclops steps away, pondering Beastis words
He understands the ramifications -- the damage that has been done to Xavier
Can the Professor repair his own mind
Iim afraid without Cerebrois help, he wonit have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter
thereis no Cerebro
Jean is noticeably upset
Heis already losing control of his vitals
Respiratory
Cardiovascular
Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, Iim afraid
We have to find Magneto
He exits
Jean follows him
- Cyclops is standing, motionless
Are you all right
No
Iim
donit know if we can do this without Charles
Jean puts her hand lovingly to his face
Cyclops takes her hand
He put you in charge for a reason, Scott
She goes to kiss him
Dr
Grey
The small girl stands alone in the hallway
(contid) Someone is here to see you
Jeanis eyes widen -- and around the corner steps Senator Kelly, wearing the clothing he had taken from the beach
He trembles as though from a high fever
His body is covered with a layer of sweat
Dr
Grey
Senator
How did you get in here
Your front door was damaged
there was a hole
Kelly makes a hole with his hands that is not much larger then that of a coffee can
(contid) squeezed through
Kelly buckles in pain, but then catches himself
Jean and Cyclops rush to help him
Beast crutches himself out to see whatis happening
Kelly notices Beast
(contid) What in Godis name are you
Iim Beast
Of course you are
-  - Xavier is in bed, eyes closed
Rogue holds vigil at his side
Kelly is in the bed next to him, trembling, burning up from what seems to be a bad fever that keeps getting worse
Jean has a syringe in her hand and is swabbing some alcohol on Kellyis skin
Iim sorry to come here, Ms
Grey was afraid if  went to a hospital, they would
(interrupting) Treat you like a mutant
We are not what you think
Not all of us
Tell it to the ones that did this to me
Jean looks closer at his hands
donit see these spikes youire talking about
Iim going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God
Jean and Kelly both look as the cotton swab ignites like flash paper in her hand
Everyone is shocked
Jean pauses and takes the bottle of alcohol from the shelf
She pours a small amount on Kellyis arm and it instantly catches fire
-  - Rogue is still sitting in a chair, next to Xavieris bed -- Xavieris opens his eyes
He looks at Rogue and smiles softly
Hello, Rogue
Rogue almost jumps out of her chair with excitement
Hold on, Iill get the others
Rogue exits
Xavier slowly looks over to Kelly lying in the bed next to him
Both men are weak and getting weaker
Senator
Kelly
Yes
Who are you
am Charles Xavier
This is my school
Kelly tries to speak, but his strength is waning
The two men are a pitiful sight, both slowly coming apart
(contid) Can you tell me what happened to you
Kelly is in pain
Itis a struggle to speak
(weak, delirious) was kidnapped
They killed mutants
There was a light
a bright
light
Xavier turns to Kelly, looking deep into his eyes
He begins to  KELLYiS
- / The following is an audio-visual collage of Kellyis perspective from throughout the film, coming back to us in a new order
in Magnetois lair as seen by Xavier
Vision fades in and out in a sedated haze
He is laid out of a gurney
(
) Whatever you do to me
no matter what -- youill make me right
Every word  have spoken will be confirmed
He looks up and sees Mystique wheeling the gurney, smiling down at the Senator
(
) And people like you are the reason was afraid to go to school as a child
Kelly is looking around a large, sphered room
In the center is the
(
) The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change
(
) can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes
The   as it is elevated into the machine
(
) In every organism on Earth there exits a mutator gene -- The -factor
The beginnings of another stage of evolution
, growing brighter and brighter
(
) God works too slowly
Pull back as if the camera is pulling back through his eye, into his head --  MICROSCOPEiS    , suddenly and violently disturbed
(
) What have you bastards done to me
CHILDiS  (
) Mom, is that a mutant
Kellyis reflection in the metal of the sink in his prison
(
) Youire a leader Senator Kelly, you set an example
Blobis face, burned by Kellyis hands
Over the cliff
(
) Demonstration of some kind
The venomous spike emerging from Kellyis hands
(
) Because if more of you
were like more of us
like more of us
(
) the  summit
the whole world will be watching

) What is it you intend to do to me
The woman staring up at him on the beach
(
) Oh
Oh God
what have you done to me
The boy on the beach
(
) Dear God
dear
God
(
) the largest single summit in the history of the planet
(
) the mutator gene will activate
(
) Welcome to the future
brother
The brotherhood of mutants
,     : Xavieris eyes burst open
- Rogue leads Storm, Jean, Beast and Cyclops quickly into the lab
Xavier is lying in his bed
Jean looks up at the screen above him and sees Xavieris brain waves have dropped severely
Kelly lies unconscious in his bed, his heart monitor weakening
Beast limps over to Xavier
Xavier struggles to speak
Beast bends down so that Xavier can whisper into his ear
Xavieris lips move as he tells Beast what he knows
-  - Jean, Storm, Beast and Cyclops talk while the news plays silently on the  in the background
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings
And he is using Adamantium as its core
Its core
Beast grabs a wax pen and draws a lightbulb on a glass drawing board
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb
He had the energy source
He had the vacuum
But he didnit have the filament
He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power
(nods -- now understanding) until he found tungsten
Beast finishes his lightbulb by drawing the filament
Correct
Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces
He used the Adamantium in Loganis dog tag to test it on the Senator
And assume now he plans to use the rest of Loganis skeleton for a larger demonstration
For what purpose
Yes -- Only thereis a problem
The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature
Itis forcing the bodyis cells to replicate thousands of times faster than theyire accustomed to
The Senatoris body is literally burning itself out
Scott -- this machine kills people and  donit think Magneto realizes it
So where do you think heis planning this larger demonstration
Jean looks down and sees Xavier pointing with a trembling hand, trying to speak
Xavier is pointing to the television
There
He is looking at yet another report on Ellis Island
Cyclops and Jean walk over
All they see on the  is an aerial shot of Manhattan, slowly coming around toward the harbor
The television image is from the
of a helicopter circling Ellis Island, taking in all the security and construction
The grand main hall to Ellis Island and finally, what the helicopter sees as it comes around for one more pass
- The sound of Kellyis heart monitor begins to Jean rushes to Kelly and touches his pale neck
She draws her hand back quickly as if burned
The heart monitor keeps speeding up until it is racing faster than a human heart could possibly produce
Jean backs away helplessly
The sheet that covers Kellyis body begins to flatten out
The sweat covering the hapless Senatoris body thickens into a viscous, clear liquid and begins to run off the table
Kelly is literally melting away
Cyclops holds Jean as she turns away
:   -- the gathering leaders of the world, the water clogged with boats, and the thousands of onlookers on Manhattan Island
All well within range
- Storm finishes preparing to leave in another section of the ready room
Beast stands by on his Beast-size crutches feeling useless
wish  could go
We all do
Storm
Try to look for the highest vantage point
From what  can figure, heill need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island
It is my feeling that Magneto has to-- Beast
Beast looks at her
(contid) Weill be fine
- Cyclops stands looking down at Professor Xavier
He starts to walk away but he is stopped
He looks down and sees that the Professor has weakly grabbed his sleeve
Cyclops looks at Xavier but he is still unconscious
His hand falls back to the bed
You can still hear me
canit you
Xavier lies still
(contid) want to thank you for taking me in
Taking us in
You have taught me everything in my life that is worth knowing
Cyclops grimly regards Xavier
(contid) And  want you to know that Iill take care of them
- Cyclops and Jean get into their uniforms
Jean is about to go to the hanger when Cyclops stops her
Hey
Iim sorry
About Logan
was jealous
(putting her arms around him) Well,  think thatis perfectly understandable
Iill tell you one thing though
Whatis that
He calls me sport one more time, and Iill blow a watermelon-sized hole through him
She smiles and kisses him
(contid) Now letis go get him
- - Cyclops, Storm, and Jean board the -Jet
They find -- , strapped into a seat, ready to go
- stands outside the jet, obviously having been kicked off
- - Jean reaches out a hand
Cyclops takes it
They squeeze tight
The -Jetis engines begin to fire up
- The hatch slowly starts to swing closed
From where she stands Rogue debates, and then runs, dashing inside as the hatch to the -Jet closes behind her
- basketball sits on the ground near the middle of the court
Suddenly the asphalt starts to vibrate and the basketball rolls a few inches
:  There is a grinding noise and the surface begins to separate at the half court line
The basketball falls through the widening hole and bounces off the wing of the rising -Jet
-
The jet turns and clears the hanger before blasting off into the night sky
- An aerial shot showing us the whole of the event
Security of every kind covers every inch of the island
Helicopters are coming in at the rate of about one every minute to deliver dignitaries and their families from all over the globe
-     - steady flow of limos pour onto the island over a simple two-lane bridge from New Jersey
With the ceremonies beginning shortly, it looks as though the last of the dignitaries have landed at Newark and Teterboro airports and will be arriving momentarily
It would seem the United Nations has had their wish tonight
There doesnit seem to be an empty seat in the house
- The pier of the Ferry to Liberty Island
great many families have come to watch curiously the going on
- The harbor is filled with police and Coast Guard vessels watching the water closely
/ - series of shots showing the many folks gathering to watch the historic event on television
In some of these apartments, Ellis and Liberty islands can be seen from their windows in the distance
- The   monitors the countless video screens that display nearly every crevice of Ellis Island as well as other parts of New York Harbor as well as the network news feeds of the event
-   - The front of the Great Hall of Ellis Island, where once immigrants poured into the new world by the millions
huge military band off to one side plays music from the different countries to help with the milling about and shaking of hands
The  himself is in the crowd, meeting and greeting, a mob of Secret Service always right there
Follow him into: - , who we will call Yassir Arafat, comes up to the President and smiles
The President introduces his    as more delegates approach
The two men  and then  to the flashing of a million bulbs
Smattering of ass-kissy applause
Arafat and the President wave to press and the like
-  - We are looking down on what    a deserted part of the island
Away from the action
Every fifty feet or so, uniformed Secret Service agents keep tight watch on the island
: One Secret Service guy in particular
- We realize we are pushing in unusually fast, as though we are falling
sickening crunch
Toad lands on top of the Secret Service guy
We have been watching from his
The Secret Service man is tumbled into a heap
real frog rabbits
Toad looks around quietly, listens
out of frame
Hold on the body of the Secret Service guy
- Two Secret Service guys approach one another
One is holding a smoke, the other is producing a lighter
Just as his smoke is about to hit the flame, the flame dodges to one side
He moves the smoke to follow it, and the flame dodges the other way
The guy with the smoke looks at the guy with the lighter as if to say iknock it off
i  The guy with the lighter shrugs as: , As they are incinerated and their ashes fall to the ground, Pyro climbs into view from the seawall below, dripping wet
He has come dressed to make trouble tonight
Strapped to his back is an impressive looking flame thrower
three tanker
- Coast Guard boat crawls into view just off shore Secret Service man in the foreground waves to the boat as it passes by
- thirty footer
Fast and sturdy
The    , a man in his late forties, waves back
- As the Secret Service guy waves, he jolts upright, his face contorting in impossible pain
Slowly, he is lifted off the ground
- PILOTiS
Sabretooth holds the last Secret Service man aloft, impaled on his claws
He waves now, the body swaying this way and that before he casually throws it to the ground
The Pilot turns to the wheel of the boat as he and turns the boat toward the island
-  - Man-made rocky shore
The boat bumps and grinds on the rock
Sabretooth jumps down to the deck and meets Magneto coming up from below
They nod to one another and walk toward the front of the boat
On the deck is something covered with a tarp
Sabretooth pulls back the tarp to reveal Logan, still unconscious from the drug
,    is on the back of the boat under another tarp, but we cannot see what it is
Magneto steps off the boat and looks up -- up at someplace we cannot yet see
-   - The dignitaries take their seats as the ceremony commences
- - Cyclops pilots the plane as Manhattan comes into view
They bank to the south
Cyclops checks his monitors
Radar Stealth Mode checks out
All right, thereill be less security north of the George Washington Bridge
Iim taking her down
Into the Hudson
(smiles) Uh-huh
- The -Jet slows to a hover
Itis Harrier Jet engines tilt back until they are vertical to the water
The engines cycle down and the plane lowers until it is hovering a few feet off the surface
- - off
- The Jetis engines cut and the plane splashes down into the water
It floats there for a moment and then sinks below the surface
- As the -Jet sinks, the hatches close off and the wings retract to transform the plane into a submarine
The engines pull tight to the body of the craft and begin to propel it forward
- : The water ripples as the submersed aircraft passes under the bridge and into the harbor
- on Logan
He wakes
His arms are cuffed behind his back
He is delirious and weakened from the drug
He looks around and sees that he is in an oddly shaped room with barely enough space for him and Magneto, who smiles at him in the half darkness
(very weak) Where am
Youire backstage at the encore of creation
He looks at his watch
(contid) Three minutes to curtain
What are you going to do
In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan
We are the future
not them
We must protect ourselves
After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants
and our cause will be theirs
This is survival,  know you understand that, Logan
or is it Wolverine
He steps out of the hatch and closes it
- Magneto who looks down
From atop what, we cannot tell
Magneto comes to stand on a railing outside from his high perch, overlooking the island
From here we pull out to reveal at last where he is
Instead, he stands on the catwalk around the torch of the Statue of Liberty, about a mile away
He has his back to itis gold translucent flame, looking over at the activity on Ellis Island, hearing the band and inhaling the cool evening breeze
Give me your tired, your poor
And he turns to the bright lights of Manhattan and itis millions of inhabitants
(contid) Your huddled masses
He brings a radio to his lips
(contid) Lights
- Sabretooth is tearing the padlocks off of the generator shed that powers the island
- Sabretooth grabs a hold of a fuse lever marked iLiberty Display Lightsi and pulls it down
Turning it off
- Logan is now in darkness
He frantically pulls on his binds
No use
- - Cyclops is monitoring the area above-water on a video screen
(points to the monitor) The lights on the Statue of Liberty are off
Beast said that he would have to take a high vantage point
Cyclops, motioning to an open area of water next to Liberty Island
Letis dock over there
Cyclops pulls a lever
The -Jet begins to surface
(contid) Storm, give us some cover
/ - Televisions all over the city show the Statue sitting dark to countless curious viewers
- - The water level outside the -Jet lowers as the plane surfaces
- - The plane rises until it is nearly flush with the surface of the water -- Not a hundred yards from an obvious Coast Guard cutter
Out the jetis window, the Statue rises away into the fog that is now rolling in over the Harbor
- : The   raises a radio to his mouth
Liberty One, Liberty One, this is Horizon, do you copy
AGENTiS
AGENTiS Go, Horizon
(on radio) Liberty, whatis the situation with the lights, over
- The lower part of her face and the whole her neck are that of a stocky man
/AGENTiS Uhhh, Horizon, weive seem to have had a shutdown at the generator, weire five by five
There now, checking it out
Everything is fine other-wise
(on radio) Roger Liberty one
Horizon out
She  back into her full self and smiles
Darling
Weire clear
- Jean, Cyclops, Storm and Rogue step off the wing tip of the -Jet onto the island
They climb over the fog encased seawall and stand staring up at the Statue and the desolate island
- Magneto takes this moment in the darkness to point his hands and all of his concentration on the bottom of the torch
The air  with magnetic energy as -- the cap-like end piece of the torch begins to vibrate, metal groans, twists
, it comes free, dropping to the ground
- Logan stares down through the hollow torch as the cap falls away into the fog
-  - The foursome are deciding how to proceed
We should check out operations, see if the Secret Service is still around
Storm is surveying the layout of the island
She looks up at the Statue
They all look up
The cap of the torch is towards them out of the sky
It crashes down as they leap out of the way
Iim going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission
Jean, can you raise me up there
Itis too far
(assessing the situation) Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance
(pointing to the main entrance) Jean and  will go in here
Storm and Rogue start for the south entrance
(contid) (to Storm and Rogue) Iill see you both soon
- Magneto prepares to execute the next stage of his plan when he looks out over the island
has rolled in, obscuring his view of the bottom half of the Statue
He looks out towards Ellis Island and sees that the fog is localized over Liberty Island
(into radio) Be careful everyone
think we may have company
- The Coast Guard boat Magneto came in on
The giant tarp on the boat and what is under it
, standing upright
The tarp slides to the deck to reveal: The one Kelly and Xavier saw
The air ripples as it rises higher in the air
- Storm and Rogue quietly enter the Statueis museum
It is filled with scale models and full size displays documenting the history of Lady Liberty
One display showcasing the   which line the Statue for support
They quickly head for an exit on the far side of the room
: The lights go out
Darkness
low guttural  echoes in the void
(whispering) Rogue
run
Rogue runs into the darkness, heading for the exit
She dashes past a six foot copper replica of the Statue and out the door
As soon as Rogue is past, the Statueis   and watches her go
The replica blinks and the eyes turn Mystique yellow
- The machine is rising
Logan yanks at the manacles in an attempt to pull his hands free
- giant room that welcomes the many visitors to the Statue
In the center is the old torch, placed there after the Statueis 1986 restoration
The only light in the room is a soft red glow that emanates from the old torch
Cyclops notices a map of the Statue on a pedestal
Over there
Cyclops and Jean study the map, looking for the way to the torch
In front of them is the old torch
Itis eerie red glow is growing brighter
-  - rises up and into the bottom of the torch itself
- The machine is now almost on him
Loganis struggles turns to rage
-- He pops his claws and frantically cuts at the wall behind him, as the machine draws closer
- We hear an ominous  , as you hear on an overcast day just before a thunderstorm begin to roll across the ceiling, lighting the room in sporadic bursts
Toad darts around the room
-- Reptile eyes --
--    -- closer --
-- leaping body -- closer --
Silence
Darkness
The heat lightning continues to expose the room in rolling flashes
Silence
Darkness
Suddenly, behind Storm the sound of Storm spins and unleashes a
The lightning strikes an empty No
- : The map of the statue
Cyclops watches as the dim red glow turns brighter and brighter
He turns to look up at the old torch -- it glows
Get down
wipes across the room
Cyclops and Jean duck behind the marble map pedestal as fire whips around them
Move up through the    to reveal Pyro at the center of the old torch
His eyes wide, manipulating the fire like an orchestra conductor
- Rogue runs down the hallway, she stops
The sound of footsteps echo from behind her
The footsteps quicken from walking to running
Rogue runs to get away as the footsteps of her pursuer get closer
- Darkness
Silence -- except for the sound of Stormis own breathing
Stormis eyes dart around the room, her senses are in overdrive
Suddenly,  drips onto her cheek
low guttural Storm looks up --  clings to the ceiling
Webbed feet slam into Stormis chest sending her flying into the elevator shaft
She crashes helplessly to the bottom -- stunned
Toadis head peers through the open elevator doors to the level below, looking down on the helpless Storm
Toad His webbed finger presses the elevator button
The elevator doors above her close, sealing her in the glass tubular shaft
The  of the hydraulic engine coming to life, the elevator begins its crushing descent down toward Storm as she lies at the bottom of the shaft dazed
- on Jean and Cyclops both pinned down
Fire sweeps around the map pedestal
Cyclops turns
-- He fires a series of   blindly through the fire, blasting the ceiling
Chunks of debris from the ceiling shower down onto Pyro
The inferno stops
Smoke fills the room, Jean tries to catch her breath
Cyclops stands and heads toward the old torch trying to draw a bead on Pyro
Cyclops doesnit see him
When: erupts from the thick smoke, rocketing at Cyclops
Cyclops dodges, flipping a heavy wood table with flaming pamphlets on it -- using it as a shield against Pyrois fiery onslaught
-  - : Magneto on the side of the torchis flame raises the huge machine -- while on the other side -- -- his hands still bound behind his back, and slams against the outer railing of the torch
Logan looks around in shock
He realizes where he is
He looks out at all the activity on Ellis Island, drawing a greater understanding of Magnetois plan
-  - With a   of the air Magneto drives the machine right up through the bottom of the torch like batteries in a flashlight
-  - Logan turns his back to the hole he has just emerged from and braces his cuffs against the rising machine
The machine pushes against Loganis wrists driving his cuffs up against the top of the hole
The pressure leaves the cuffs apart
- Stormis eyes open, looking straight up
: The elevator continuing its crushing descent
Storm struggles to her feet
Her hand presses against the thick glass elevator shaft, it surrounds her like a coffin
strike the glass -- to no effect
Storm frantically searches for a way out
She looks up to see the elevator closing fast
Storm raises her hands above her head
begins to lift Stormis hair
The wind picks up and starts swirling violently against the sides of the elevator shaft
Wildly, the wind whips around causing a  within the glass shaft buffeting upwards against the elevator
The elevator groans as the hydraulics fight the unrelenting vortex of wind
Smoke begins to pour from the hydraulics, which whine in protest
At the center of the tornado stands Storm, a force of nature
As the elevator continues its descent the cyclone pushes outward
Small cracks start to appear on the glass walls
She is now forced almost to the ground
The elevator is now inches from Stormis head
The floor is made of a thicker version of the same Plexiglas and we look up through it, the massive elevator looming over Storm
The glass walls explode outward, showering the museum
Storm partly rolls and is partly blown from the shaft to safety
The pressure of the cyclone released, the elevator  to the bottom
- Jean, having caught her breath, looks over to: on Cyclops
Heis pinned down as fire wraps around the table -- the fire is burning through
Jean, seeing Cyclops defenseless, stands up from behind the marble podium
She quickly scans the room and spots, on opposite walls near the old torch, Jean stretches out her fists and focuses her telekinesis
Pyro spots Jean -- with one hand continuing to blast Cyclops, he uses the other to unleash an toward Jean
Jean focuses as she brings her outstretched fists closer together
Suddenly -- the two fire extinguishers crash through their glass holders
Like two gunslingers in a showdown
The extinguishers bullet toward Pyro
The arm of fire rockets closer to Jean
Suddenly, the    in front of Pyro
Inches from Jeanis face, the    disappears
The    against Scott
The flames once covering the room are gone, a choking smoke is all that remains
Through the smoke, at the center of the old torch, Pyro lies dead, covered in a sea of white foam
Jean starts choking on the smoke
Cyclops stands and motions for her to get out of the smoke filled room
-  - The machine finally locks into place
Magneto raises a walkie talkie to his face
Lights on
- Sabretooth grabs a hold of the lever for the iLiberty Displayi power breaker and pulls up
Turning it on
-   - The lights of the Statue come back on
The crowd of dignitaries burst into enthusiastic applause as if it is part of the proceedings
- The Statue now lit up in the monitors
Roger
We see the lights
-  - Magneto turns and opens the hatch
Magneto sees the hole -- Logan is gone
-  - Magneto walks over and stares at the hole, clearly out by Loganis claws
Magneto looks at his fingers after wiping the edge of the hole
Loganis blood
Magneto looks down and sees Loganis claw marks down the arm of the Statue, marking his escape
Magneto scans the island from his high perch
He does not see Logan
-   - The doors to the old torch room burst open -- Jean runs out coughing violently
Suddenly, Toad lands in front of Jean, grabs her head and before she can react, his tongue launches at her face
His tongue covers her face with an
Jean falls to the ground
Toad looks back at the main entrance, sees Cyclops emerging and  up, out of frame
: Cyclops stumbles out of the smoke filled building
Seeing Jean lying on the ground, he runs to her
Cyclops turns Jean on her back, ready to perform
He is shocked, the slime has now hardened to Jeanis face
She is suffocating
He desperately tries to pry it off
: The camera quickly pulls higher and higher revealing -- TOADiS
- Toad looks down, perched on top of the railing surrounding the base of the Statue -- the same position he had before crushing the Secret Service agent
Toad arches his back ready to spring downward
He will kill two birds with one crushing leap
The sound of
Toadis face static, his eyes slowly look to the side
His head twists, looking over his shoulder
Storm stands behind him
Toad turns and hops off the railing towards Storm
on TOADiS
Which is horrible
Donit you people die
Suddenly the wind picks up violently
Toad moves closer -- fighting the wind
Storm is
face we remember seeing on a young girl in Africa
Toad fights the gale force winds, his webbed feet adhering to the ground
He inches closer to Storm
Toad bares his
-   - On the ground Cyclops notices the wind howling with rage above him
He frantically pulls on the encrusted slime suffocating Jean
- Stormis eyes widen
force winds blast Toad
Try as he might to use his sticky feet to hold on, Toad is blown back off his feet, catching the deck with his hands
The piece of the deck   still attached to Toadis hands
He flies off the deck, past the metal railing
Toadis tongue For a moment, Toad just flaps there like a flag
Storm
--  huge    strikes the railing
Toad is blown off the railing in a flash of electricity and -- - Toad lands in the water
He disappears below the surface leaving nothing but bubbles
- Storm moves to the railing
She looks down at Cyclops and Jean
Suddenly, the metal railing on which her hands rest
-   - Cyclops continues to pull on the slime
Jeanis struggles are becoming more panicked
Cyclops stops and puts his hands on Jeanis shoulders, pinning her down
Jean
Jean stop
Stop moving
Jean continues to struggle for a moment
She starts to calm down, her chest still hitching involuntarily for air
(contid) Jean, trust me
Donit move
He takes a hold of her chin and grips it tightly
He , , splitting it in half
He pulls the remains away from her face
Jean  for air
Then she looks up
Her face turns to horror
Behind Cyclops, towering over him is -- Sabretooth
Sabretooth smashes down
- Rogue turns the corner of the hallway and trips, tumbling to the ground
Rogue watches from the floor as the shadow of her pursuer bends around the corner
The sound of their footsteps get closer
The shadow is upon her, turning the corner
It is
didnit mean to scare you
Thank God
Logan
we have to help Storm we have to
Logan looks around to make sure itis clear
Iill go back, but first let me find you a safe place
Logan extends his hand
(contid) Here, take my hand
Rogue looks at Logan confused
Logan grows impatient
(contid) Take it
: Over Loganis shoulder
On the back of his neck we see some
Logan is not Logan, Logan is -  - -on Magnetois belt, which is lined with Magnetois hand comes into frame holding CYCLOPSi and places it against one of the straps
The strap , pinning the visor to the belt
He brings a radio to his mouth
(into radio) Mystique
Mystique, where are you
Magneto turns to Sabretooth
(contid) Find Logan
Sabretooth exits as Magneto turns to reveal -- Jean and Cyclops, without his visor, are trapped in a hideous tangle of metal (taken from the Statueis steel bracing) forcing the two to face each other
Two sharp points of metal rest on either side of Cyclopsi head, locking it in position
Cyclopsi is close enough to feel Jeanis breath -- if he opens his eyes, he will destroy everything in his path, including Jean
Storm is also encased in a myriad of sharp metal bands, pinning her to the wall
Razor sharp pieces of metal warp and close on her throat
All in all, they are completely disabled
Jean struggles to free them with her telekinesis, to no avail
(whispering) Jean
can you
(whispering) Iim sorry
Iim not strong enough
Magneto stands next to Storm
Close
(whispering) If the temperature changes a single degree
(looking at Jean) only need one hostage
Magneto stares icily at Storm
As if to accentuate the threat, a piece of metal pokes ever so slightly into the side of Stormis throat
(contid) (raising his voice) Now if you can hear me Logan
- We find Logan -- The real Logan
He has made it off the Statue and is about to jump off the seawall
He stops suddenly
of his ear
His powerful hearing enables him to hear Magneto
(
) and  know you can -- It is a five minute run from the furthest distance on this island
If you are not back in this time
will kill these friends of Xavieris
Including the young lady from the gymnasium think they came here to irescue you
i -  - Magneto looks to his hand -- the  from Cerebro
(contid) also have a small piece of Cerebro that might be of interest to you, if you hope to save Charles Xavier
- (
) Xavier is dying you know
Five minutes Logan
Loganis face shows the frustration
Again, he is forced to make a decision
-  - Magneto pulls out the chip taken from Cerebro and walks over to Jean
Here -- Xavieris life
He tucks it in an exposed part of her uniform
(contid) If  get what  want, you can try and save him
for old times sake
Magneto turns to Storm
(contid) Now
shall we talk about the weather
-   - The President addresses the audience
We move across all the worldis leaders sitting with their families
Men, women and children of every race, color and creed that the planet Earth has to offer
-  - Magneto
Iive seen the results of your machine
Iive seen Senator Kelly
Ahhhh, so the good Senator survived his fall
And the swim to shore
He is stronger than  ever could have imagined
The experiment was a failure
Kelly didnit make it
Yes, you were successful in activating his mutator gene, but you failed to take into account the rest of his body -- it wasnit ready for the strain
Kelly was dead within hours
Your machine kills
Quiet
Magneto pauses
Shock registering on his face that he could be wrong
Thinking
Considering what Jean is telling him
His mind races and calculates the possibility
Then: (contid) donit believe you
You donit understand
Magneto gets angry -- squeezing the metal surrounding Jeanis head
Jean gasps
This drives Cyclops crazy, but he is helpless to stop it
(yelling) Stop it
Why canit you see what  am trying to do
Why do you stand in my way
Magnetois anger is boiling over
-- the sound of footsteps, then another and another
The faces around the room look at the stairs as the footsteps get closer and louder
(contid) Check and mate
:   -- Loganis claws shoot up through the floor, and through Magnetois feet
Magneto howls
The claws retract and Magneto falls
Magneto, writhes in pain, rolling onto his stomach
Logan quickly comes up the stairs and into the Statueis head
He stands over the crippled Magneto
Logan turns to Jean who is still pressed eye to eye with Cyclops
He is relieved to see her alive
: Storm
She sees something
Several of the steel bands that support the top of the Statueis head begin to move
Logan
peel off the ceiling, coming to life with magnetic energy
They leap across the room and wrap around Logan
Forcing his fists to press against his chest
Should he so much as extend his claws, he will rupture his own vitals
The metal bands wrap behind his back
Magneto raises his hand and
Metal groans as Magneto peels open a gaping hole in the top of Lady Libertyis head
Magneto looks up at the torch
The wind howls
The   again as Magneto levitates the steel bands holding Logan, lifting Logan off the ground and out the hole in the Statueis head
-  - thrust Logan through the air and -- - --  the metal skin of the flame
Logan lands in the center of the sphere on top of the machine
Inside the sphere is a metal structure resembling the model of an atom
Its rings expand as it receives Logan
Logan looks through the hole in the frame, down into the hole in the Statueis head, at Magneto
-  - Magneto struggles to his feet, pulling himself up by his hands
Magneto stares at Logan, impatient
Magneto stands with a hand raised up toward the machine
Then a slight motion of his wrist -- - The rings start revolving just as it did with Kelly, back at the lair
Spinning slowly, then gaining in speed
The air around it , gaining in intensity
-  - from Magnetois hands toward the machine, behind him Jean and Storm watch helplessly
- The rings are spinning around Logan at such a speed, the rings themselves are no longer visible -- merely a blur around the stationary Logan
Logan yells
Unthinkable pain, his skeleton beginning to glow through his skin
His eyes look down, through the hole in the torch, into the Statueis head, searching for Jean
The deafening whine builds louder and louder
-  - Magneto looks at the incredible displays as flows from his hands continuing to charge the machine
Mystique emerges from the stairwell behind Magneto
Her eyes widen in awe
Ahh, there you are
Mystique walks slowly toward magneto
Storm and Jean watch the torch in horror
(to Mystique) You have to stop him, the machine
it kills people
Mystique ignores Jean
She stops behind Magneto
She looks up and sees Logan staring back in agony
(contid) Please do something
Magneto tilts his head slightly, acknowledging Jean, but not moving from his task
Donit listen to her
itis a trap
Magneto turns
What is
This is
And she grabs the sides of his face and kisses him deeply
There is an awkward moment
Until: Once, then again
Then he struggles to be set free
And
It has been her all along, using   powers borrowed from the real Mystique
Magneto fights to get free, but his power is being drained from him
,
Rogue goes to pull away,   WONiT
Magneto grabs hold of Rogueis throat --
- Logan looking down, through the hole in the Statueis head for Jean, sees Rogue and Magneto struggle
Logan watches helplessly as
-- His flesh starts to
-  - Magneto is strangling Rogue, who clings to his face -- drawing his powers
The walls  as magnetic energy  through the Statueis head
: Rogue, choking to death, looks frantically at Cyclops for help
She raises one of her hands and uses Magnetois stolen power to      so that Cyclops is able to move his head again
Without his visor however, he is still unable to open his eyes
Magneto, feeling the last of his power draining from him, grabs Rogue tightly and  her into the wall
Rogue slumps in Magnetois arms and the two collapse to the ground
- The sound from the machine is
-- At the silence, all eyes turn to the torch
It is too late --
Loganis eyes tense
He clenches his teeth
Logan does the unthinkable
The glowing white claws extend through Loganis chest and out his back cutting three metal straps binding him
Logan  in pain as he -- Pulls his claws from his chest
-- his claws rip through the inside of the machine - - cutting apart the rings spinning around him
The translucent torch of the Statue is -   - The President and the dignitaries turn
Secret Service rush to the window
wave of panic sweeps the crowd
- The flaming torch lights up one of many screens
Liberty one this is Horizon repeat
do you copy
Liberty one this is Horizon
repeat
do you copy
-  - Where the flame of the torch once stood, now stands Logan, his skeleton cooling down
Logan leans on the torchis railing, his chest bleeds from the six claw wounds
Logan is exhausted
He looks down at his comrades still trapped by the metal bands
And Magneto lying powerless on the floor
, from below -- strikes Loganis chest
The blow sends Logan sailing back to the far end of the torch
Logan lies against the railing
Opening his eyes he sees -- following upward to a very angry, very large Sabretooth, towering over him
Sabretooth leaps at Logan
Against the New York skyline ,
- Several Coast Guard cutters head full-speed toward Liberty Island
: Their decks covered with armed Secret Service
- Sabretooth picks up Logan over his head and throws him like a rag doll into the railing on the other side of the torch
Logan struggles to his feet -- dazed
Suddenly, Sabretooth, running at full steam, tackles him
Slamming Logan into the railing
The metal railing bends
Sabretooth holds Logan by his wrists, trying to push him over the edge
It is several hundred feet to the ground below
Logan is weakening
Sabretooth is in complete control, he leans down near Loganis ear
(whispering) Your girlfriend is next
With all his might, Logan pushes his clenched fists as close to Sabretoothis face as he can
The claws pop
Sabretooth springs back to protect his face
flies back to the other side of the torch
leaps up and running at full speed, tackles Sabretooth -- like a train plowing into a stalled car
The metal railing snaps and they both go flying through the air
-  - Sabretooth and Logan slam onto the top of the Statueis head
Logan rolls off the back of the Statueis head and falls
Sabretooth stands and looks over the edge - nothing
All he can see is the Statueis body curving away towards the ground
He smiles, and turns back to the hole
-  - :  - Hanging from the ear of the Statue, the claws of his right hand embedded in the lobe at the end of three sets of long claw-marks
He looks up
look of brutal determination crosses his face
Straining, he pulls himself up by his right arm
The cords stand out on his neck as he tries to get to shoulder level
He aims his left claw a little further up on the ear and -- He drives it in
-  - --
Sabretoothis feet as he lands on the metal floor
He quickly takes in the situation, Magneto and Rogue are still unconscious
He walks towards Storm
The air in the room starts to  and Sabretoothis hair begins to stand on end as it did when these two last confronted each other
donit think so
Sabretooth backhands Storm across the jaw, knocking her out
As her head drops, he draws his claws and slashes it down
It , just before tearing open Stormis throat,
He turns and sees that Jean has focused her power in his arm
He smiles
He walks to Jean and tears off her bonds
He reaches out to grab her neck but his claw is stopped again in mid- air
Sabretooth just smiles wider and forces his hand forward
The outcome never really in doubt, the claw wraps around Jeanis neck
She begins to choke
Jean
Sabretooth lifts Jean by the neck and walks away from Cyclops as he chokes her
Sorry about this sweetheart, but made Logan a promise
Jean struggles desperately against Sabretoothis unbreakable grip, the life draining from her
Then -- (
) Hey, ya big pussy
Sabretooth whips around, still clutching Jean to see - - Bleeding, beaten and panting, and yet still standing defiantly over Magnetois unconscious body
(contid) ainit finished with you yet
Sabretooth looks at him, disbelieving that this man can still be standing, let alone challenging him
and he starts to laugh
You
Logan grins
Not just me
And with that: he extends   from his right hand, squats down, and cuts the piece of metal holding Cyclopsi visor to Magnetois belt
He lifts it up and it slides down his claw to his hand
He casually throws it in the air
(contid) Jean
Logan looks at the visor and it freezes in the air
It flies across the room, right past Sabretoothis head
He lunges at it with his free claw but just misses it
The visor lands square on Cyclopsi eyes, and attaches itself to Cyclopsi face
He turns
focused   hits Sabretooth like a He drops Jean and
- We see the side of the Statueis head
Suddenly, Sabretooth
For a moment Cyclopsi beam continues to fire through the eye as if the Statue itself is imitating Cyclopsi power
- Magnetois boat still sits quietly next to the seawall
Sabretoothis body     of the boat
The tarp flies up and drifts back down to rest over Sabretoothis body
-  - Loganis breathing is strained, a blood stain in the middle of his shirt, but he is in control
Logan looks up, his eyes met by Jeanis
He walks over to Storm and Cyclops and
cuts them loose
Jean and Cyclops catch Storm, who begins to come around
Cyclops smiles
Logan kneels down beside Rogue
He wants to comfort her but cannot touch her
She opens her eyes and sees Logan
Hey
There you are
(sudden apprehension) Is it really you
(not quite sure what sheis talking about) Yeah, itis really me
Come on, letis get out of here
Logan stands
He takes a couple of steps before collapsing in Cyclopsi arms
(sliding to the ground) Iim o
k
Iim o
k
Sure you are, sport
-  - Several Coast Guard cutters and police boats reach the island
Men run across the dock as we pull up -- - The Coast Guard, Secret Service, and  descend upon the island
- Security enters the smoldering remains of the old torch room
The walls blackened by a past inferno
At the center, Pyro lies motionless in a sea of foam
- Push in on  who is tied up
Across her feet a crack of light as the door begins to open
Swish pan over to the  entering the room
Swish pan back
Mystique has taken the form of a Secret Service agent
/ Hey, could somebody untie me
- Secret Service spots the wreckage of Magnetois boat and the large tarp which covers it
He pulls his gun
#3 (to other agents) Hey
Over here
Three other agents pull their guns and aim at the tarp
The first agent pulls it back to reveal
nothing
Sabretooth is gone
-  - and Secret Service rush up the stairs and into the head
Magneto lies unconscious on the floor
The lead guy, an   in a flak jacket, holding a shotgun, stares up at the ceiling
He peers out through the gaping hole
Beyond the damaged torch the star filled sky is momentarily eclipsed by a aircraft -- the - Jet
The officer turns to say something, but stops -- wondering if his eyes were merely playing tricks on him
- Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Rogue and about two dozen students all sit in front of a wide screen  watching the Special Report on the Mutant Registration Act vote
As the Anchorman speaks we move over the concerned looks on all of their faces
(
) Even after last weeks terrorist vandalization of the Statue of Liberty by an unidentified mutant organization, the outcome of the vote was 51 to 49 in opposition to the Mutant Registration Act
as the room erupts into celebration
Quiet
Quiet everybody
This narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by Senator Scott iFranki Kelly, who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for Mutant Registration
Earlier today, Kelly had this to say: The  cuts to a shot of Kelly being grilled by reporters as he walks down the Capitol steps
(struggling to get through) If we can not go into the future together, the divisions of fear and prejudice will tear this country apart
As he is speaking, we cut to: -
- Kelly pushing past reporters
No more questions
Please, no more questions
The back of Kellyis neck as he passes is visible above his collar
LOGANiS  - The   are heard through the walls
-- light pushes through blinds gentle breeze moves them slightly
Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged
-- the sound of blinds being pulled open
Bright sunshine fills the room, washing across a box and a card sitting on a bureau
: the card as Logan reads it
--
It is signed simply,
Logan reaches in the box, pulling out -- a
He lays it on the bed
He pulls on one of the gloves, stretching his fingers in it
Perfect fit
-- He pops his claws through on the back of the glove -- clearly it was made specifically for him
Logan looks down into the box for him
LOGANiS  -  - From behind Logan we see him finish putting something on over his head
Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a dark blue
It fits his head neatly
The sides arch up shadowing his ears, giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance
The shape is reminiscent of Loganis sketch -- the wolverine
Logan stands facing a mirror
The mask looks good on him and he seems to know it
Xavier is in the doorway
Logan pulls off the mask, embarrassed
Donit you knock
Theyire all asking how youire doing
Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone
(pulling the glove off) Actually Iim feeling up to leaving
Logan walks over to the closet and pulls out a shirt
He puts it on
(surprised) Why
You have a home here now, if you want it
Everyone will
What
miss me
Charley, Iim gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it wonit be soon enough for everyone here
Logan pulls a duffle bag out of the closet
(contid) Can , umm
Of course
Everything in this room is for you
Logan seems genuinely touched by the gesture
Thanks, Iill pay you back
Logan shoves some clothes into the bag, but not all
Well if youire going to leave then you at least owe them a goodbye
Logan smirks
He picks up his bag
They exit the room together
- The celebration continues unabated
The newscaster on the defeat of the Mutant Registration Act muted, in the background -- Storm, Jean, and Cyclops all sit around a table chatting
Rogue sits on the couch with other students, trying on a new pair of leather gloves
(
) Excuse me
(louder) Excuse me
Xavier is in the doorway
(contid) Everyone, Logan would like to say
Logan steps into the doorway
Everyone can see him now
Before Xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted by -- -- simple, genuine, applause
Students slowly stand up
Proud of Logan
For he is one of them
He is a mutant
And he is a hero
As the unconditional applause echoes around him, Logan seems sincerely touched by their spontaneous outpouring
He is almost choked up -- almost
The applause quiet
(contid) Well, Logan
All eyes are on Logan
Logan pauses
He looks to Xavier, then back to the room
Whatis a guy gotta do to get a beer around here
Logan puts his duffle bag down
He walks over to the table with Storm, Cyclops and Jean
Jean smiles at him, so does Cyclops -- his arm around the back of her chair
Logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he offers a smile
Xavier holds for a moment at the door
look of pride on his face, the pride a father has for his children
- Thatis right,
Everything we can see -- walls, ceiling, floor -- is made, entirely, of thick, clear plastic
: There, in the middle, at the clear plastic desk, with two clear plastic cups filled with the only thing of color other than the two men in the room
Xavier and Magneto
They play a friendly game of chess
Magneto is notably without his trademark helmet
Two casts encase his legs from his Logan-inflicted injury
Xavier is on a modified plastic chair with plastic wheels
wouldnit really have let you die, you know
just needed
(interrupting) know
Magneto thinks for a while; then: Doesnit it ever wake you in the middle of the night
The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children
Take you all away
It does indeed, Max
And what do you do when you wake up to that
feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble
He stares right at Magneto
Xavier makes a move, Magneto counters
Xavier moves again
But you know that it is a war, old friend
And to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs, by any means necessary
And for that reason, will always have the advantage
No matter how you trap me, how  am contained - Chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation Xavieris white pieces slowly surrounding Magnetois Black King
(contid) -  will always find an escape
And  will always be there, old friend
And with that, Xavier places his queen gently down, taking away a knight
(contid) Check
Just then, the door to the cell opens
Guard waits
Magneto and Xavier stare at one another before Xavier turns and wheels himself out of the room
The door closes behind him, leaving Magneto alone with his plastic chess set in his plastic cell
And Magneto looks at the pieces before him
Something occurs to him
He smiles a wicked smile
And his rook , despite its properties, moving across the board and toppling Xavieris king
And mate
