An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer
the figure is reading a book
: In the distance, growing louder
over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the      to the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On

Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off

You're late
:  glowers at the young Hobbit
Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early
He arrives precisely when he means to
They look at each other a moment
then both start laughing as ' face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf
Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are
Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall
You didn't think 'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday
: 8
-- Wide on: The cart rattles past a   being tended by What news of the outside world
Tell me everything
: Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye
What, everything
Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit
Most unnatural
Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace
(
) (') Well, what can  tell you
Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age
Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits
Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him
(') for which  am very thankful
: Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn
towards
Wide on: The party field
Where scOrcs of Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night
(') Ah, the long expected party
So, how is the old rascal
hear it's going to be a Party of Special Magnificence
You know Bilbo
he's got he whole place in an uproar
Oh, well
that should please him
() 9
: Half the Shire's been invited
Good gracious, me
He's up to something
Oh, really
Frodo shoots a knowing look, as Gandalf averts his eyes
Alright then
keep your secrets
Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of
Indeed
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected
If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon
was barely involved
all did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door
Whatever you did
you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace
Oh, really
: looks up as the Cart passes by, deeply suspicious
: -- : As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton
a quaint rustic settlement, nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees
() 10
: The Hobbits live in Hobbit Holes: neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens
: Excited children, chasing after the cart
: Gandalf ignOrcs the children's cries
The children stand deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane
At that moment: spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children
: Gandalf smiling to himself, well pleased with his joke is unable to suppress a chuckle
Frodo stands up in the cart as Gandalf reigns in the horse
Gandalf
'm glad you're back
Frodo leaps expertly from the cart
Gandalf smiles
So am , dear boy
so am : -- Wide on: '  pulls up outside the gate to a particularly fine example of a Hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside
There is a sign on the gate which reads: " " Gandalf strides up to the garden path of Bag End
He raises his staff and raps on the front door
a voice calls out: (
) No, thank you
We don't want any more visitors, well wishers, or distant relations
And what about very old friends
Suddenly the door opens and   stands before him
He is a    , with a mischievous Twinkle in his eye
Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman

: Gandalf
Bilbo Baggins
My dear Gandalf
Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend
It's good to see you
One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it
Gandalf looks at him more keenly
(') You haven't aged a day
Gandalf and Bilbo laugh together and enter Bag End
Come on, come in
Welcome, welcome
: -- Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End
cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of Bilbo's travels
Gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling
Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall
(Calling) Tea
Or maybe something stronger
've a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296
a very good year, almost as old as am
It was laid down by my father
What say we open one, eh
Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around
enjoying the familiarity of Bag End
he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam
He groans
(
) (') was expecting you some time last week
Not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will
() () 12
: (
) (') You've caught me a bit unprepared, 'm afraid
we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here
ooh, no, that might be a little risky
Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner
it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf smiles to himself
(') Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart
got some custard somewhere
Not much for Afters, 'm afraid
Oh no
we're alright
've just found some sponge cake
Nice little snack
Hope it's enough
(comes into view) could do you some eggs if you like
Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him
Just tea, thank you
Oh
right
You don't mind if
No, not at all
Go ahead
sudden loud knock on the front door
(
) Bilbo Baggins, you open this door
know you're in there
'm not home
Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide
(') 've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace
want to see mountains again
mountains, Gandalf
and then find somewhere quiet where  can finish my book
Oh, Tea
So, you mean to go through with your plan, then
() 13
: Yes, yes
it's all inhand
All the arrangements are made
Frodo suspects something
'Course he does, he's a Baggins
not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle
You will tell him, won't you
Yes, yes
He's very fond of you
know
He'd probably come with me if asked him
think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields
little rivers
Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window
(') am old, Gandalf
Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly
(') know  don't look it, but 'm beginning to feel it in my heart
: Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket
gripping a small, unseen object
(') feel thin
sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread need a holiday
a very long holiday and don't expect  shall return
in fact, mean not to
: 14
-- Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch
Below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field
Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe
Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing
Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air
tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring
(') Ohhhh, (smiles) Gandalf my old friend
this will be a night to remember

in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches
: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches
evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff
Bilbo is greeting visitors
Frodo and  sit at a table drinking ale
Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away
Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance
(horrified) think 'll just have myself another ale
Oh, no you don't
Go on
Sam goes to drain his glass
suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers
15
: ' as he is Swept away
Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer
: Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests
Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children
(melodramatic) So, there  was
at the mercy of three monstrous trolls
Have you ever heard of a troll
Do you know what a Troll is
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things
and they're arguing
arguing about how they were going to cook us
:    ' upturned face
her eyes growing larger and larger
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly
But they spent so long arguing the whether-to's and why-for's that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees
and turned them all to stone
from his young Audience greet his astonishing feat
Close on:   , two mischievous Young Hobbits in their late teens
Pippin scrambles on to the back of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework (urgent whisper) No, no
the big one
the big one
Pippin grabs a huge rocket
: crackles with flame
Merry is holding out the big rocket
he looks aghast at the fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit
(') (worried whisper) You're supposed to stick it in the ground
() 16
: It is in the ground
Merry fearfully tosses the Rocket to Pippin
The fuse sizzles angrily
Outside
It was your idea
Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry
The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening power
The   over the Party
It suddenly bursts apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon
Fire gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low towards the startled crowd
Close on: Frodo watches the Fireworks Dragon with alarm
but Bilbo is oblivious to the Panicking crowd and impending danger
Bilbo
Watch out for the dragon
Dragon
Nonsense
hasn1t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years
: As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express train
Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, food flies everywhere
The fireworks dragon turns a somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night
:   , clothes and hair smoking
That was good
Let's get another one
suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears
Low angle: Gandalf looking
() 17
: Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took might have known
: Are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water
with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale
Cries of "
" erupt from the party
: Bilbo stepping on a stool
he bows in gratitude at the applause
Speech
(clearing throat) My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and Brandybucks
Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots
: Proudfeet
Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday
Yes, and alas
Eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits
Tremendous outburst of approval
(') don't know half of you half as well as should like; and  like less than half of you as well as well as you deserve
as the guests try to work out if that was a compliment or not
:    smiling to themselves
: Bilbo
a strange hum seems to fill his head
bead of sweat rolls down his brow
Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back
() 18
: (') have
things to do and  have put this off for far too long
: ' knuckles turn white as he tightens his grip on the small object behind his back
(') regret to announce, this is the end am going now
bid you all a very fond farewell
Bilbo looks across at Frodo, hesitates
then
(') (whisper) Goodbye
Bilbo instantly vanishes
The party explodes into an uproar
the crowd leaps to its feet
: staring at the empty stool in disbelief
: -- The party is still in an excited uproar
some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand
-- The door quietly closes
Bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger
Bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket
: Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick
He finds Gandalf looming over him
suppose you think that was terribly clever
Come on, Gandalf
Did you see their faces
() 19
: There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly
It was just a bit of fun
Oh, you're probably right as usual
You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you
'm leaving everything to him
What about this ring of yours
Is that staying too
Close on: Bilbo
he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece
Yes, yes, it's in an envelope
over there on the mantelpiece
Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece
Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise
(') No, wait
It's here in my pocket
Isn't that
isn't' that odd now
Yet, after all, why not
Why shouldn't  keep it
think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo
Is that so hard
Well, no
and yes
Now it comes to it, don't feel like parting with it
It's mine
found it
It came to me
:
There's no need to get angry
Well, if 'm angry, it's your fault
It's mine
My own, my precious
() 20
: Precious
It's been called that before, but not by you
So
What business is it of yours what do with my own things
Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed
think you've had that ring quite long enough
You want it for yourself
Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks
Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power
a frightened Hobbit
Gandalf's expression softens
(') am not trying to rob you
am trying to help you
Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him
(') All you long years we've been friends
trust me as you once did
Let it go
You're right, Gandalf
the ring must go to Frodo
Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door
(') It's late, the road is long
yes, it is time
Bilbo
Hmmm
() 21
: (2) The ring is still in your pocket
Bilbo hesitates
reaches into his pocket
Oh, yes
: Bilbo pulls out the ring
he stares at it in his palm
With all his will power, Bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor
: The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor
-- : Bilbo staggering out of Bag end
he braces himself in the night air, Pale and Trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him
Gandalf steps up behind
've thought up and ending for my book
"And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days
" 'm sure you will, my dear friend
Goodbye, Gandalf
Goodbye Bilbo
Bilbo walks away from Bag End, disappearing into the night, softly singing: "The Road goes on and on
" (') (softly) Until our next meeting
: -- :
Glinting on the floor
Gandalf circles around it, a Puzzled look on his face
Gandalf slowly reaches for the ring
His fingers barely touch the ring
the creepy Hum rises on the soundtrack
Gandalf is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe
staring into the flickering flames

: (
) It's mine, my own, my precious

) Bilbo
Bilbo
Frodo rushes into Bag End
he stops and picks up the ring at his feet
Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought
(to himself) My precious

(quietly) He's gone, hasn't he
Frodo steps into the living room
(') He talked for so long about leaving didn't think he'd really do it
(mutters to himself) my own
Gandalf
Gandalf turns
his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's fingers
Bilbo's ring
Gandalf sorts hurriedly through Bilbo's papers
(') He's gone to stay with the Elves
He's left you Bag End
Gandalf holds out the envelope
Frodo drops the ring into it
(') along with all his possessions
Gandolf seals the envelope with wax
He hands it to Frodo
() 23
: (2) (') The ring is yours now
But it somewhere out of sight
Gandalf rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things
Where are you going
have some things  must see to
What things
Questions
Questions that need answering
You've only just arrived
don't understand
Gandalf is already at the door, he turns to Frodo
Neither do
Keep it secret, keep it safe
Gandalf hurries out the door
leaving  standing alone in the Bag End
: The camera pushes in
the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack
The camera pushes through the white paper to the ring
beneath the hum the whispered murmur of can be heard

All is quiet
Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room
large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo
Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his Assailant
Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight
Paranoia blazes in his eyes
His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling
Hair and beard much longer an unkempt

Is it safe
: -- Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest
Gandalf, suspicious, Alert
Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace
(bewildered) What are you doing
Flames instantly consume the envelope
revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers
Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs
he lifts the ring out
Hold out your hand, Frodo
it is quite cool
Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand
he reacts to its weight
(') What can you see
Can you see anything
Nothing
there's nothing
Wait

: : The Gold Band of the ring as fiery letters begin to appear
a tiny inscription glows red
as if burning from within
these are markings
: It's some form of Elvish

(ominous) There are few who can
the language is that of Mordor, which  will not utter here
Mordor
In the common tongue it says, "One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
" : -- : The ring lies on Frodo's simple kitchen table
This is the one ring forged by the dark lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom
taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself
: (quiet realization) Bilbo found it
in Gollom's cave
For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age
but no longer, Frodo
Evil is stirring in Mordor
The ring has awoken
It has heard its master's call

: (') :  , of emanates from the Ring
Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it
But he was destroyed
Sauron was destroyed

No, Frodo
The spirit of Sauron has endured
His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived
Sauron has returned
His Orcs have multiplied
his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor
Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness
He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it
For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord
Frodo, he must never find out
Frodo scoops up the Ring
Alright

(thinking fast) We put it away, we keep it hidden
We never speak of it again
No one know it's here, do they
Gandalf shifts uncomfortably

But it cannot stay in the Shire

You must leave, and leave quickly

It's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think

What did you hear
Speak
(panicked) Nothing important
that is,  heard a good deal about a ring

Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible -- Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains
(
) Smoke rises once more from the mountain of doom
the shadow takes shape in the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows late
and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel

Saruman

Are you sure of this
Beyond any doubt
So the ring of power has been found
All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose
And yet you did not have the wit to see it
Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind
We still have time
time enough to counter Sauron
if we act quickly
Time
What time do you think we have
: - -- Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber
() 36
: Sauron has regained much of his former strength
He cannot yet take physical form
but his spirit has lost none of its potency
Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh
You know of what  speak, Gandalf
a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame
(softly) The eye of Sauron
He is gathering all evil to him

You know this

Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth
palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman
Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir
Why
Why should we fear to use it
They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones

Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir

Sauron's forces are already moving

They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in black

Saruman shrugs
They will find the ring
and kill the one who carries it
Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door
horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut
(') You did not seriously think a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron
There are none who can
Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman

(') Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory
We must join with him, Gandalf
We must join with Sauron
It would be wise, my friend
(deadly) Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness
At that moment: Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room
He slams against the wall
pinned there by some unseen force
With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on Saruman
blasting him off his feet
Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room

Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp
it flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand
Gandalf is flung to the floor

Arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford

She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King

The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes
The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge

Yes, 'm here and you're lucky to be here, too

So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction

Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo
Nothing, Frodo
Sam runs to Frodo's bedside
He is overjoyed to find Frodo awake
Frodo
Frodo
Bless you, you're awake
Sam has hardly left your side
We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr
Gandalf
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend
, , steps up to Frodo's bedside
his face is neither old nor young, though in it is written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins
Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with awe

a small cluster of elegant Elven Buildings sitting in a Shangri-la like Valley below towering cliffs and snow capped mountains

) You have found your way to the last homely house east of the sea
The elves of Imladris have dwelt within this valley for three thousand years through few of my kin now remain
Frodo looks out from his balcony

Suddenly, the voices of Merry and Pippin can be heard as they bound up to Frodo and throw their arms around him
Frodo
Frodo
Sam looks past Frodo smiling
a bent figure sits alone on a bench, in the Sun
Close on: Frodo turning, following Sam's gaze
Bilbo
: -- Close on:
He breaks in to a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him
Bilbo has aged significantly since we last saw him
Hello, Frodo, my lad
Bilbo
Frodo is turning the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal: (') (reading) "There and back again:  Hobbit's tale" by Bilbo Baggins
Bilbo smiles Proudly
He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a Waterfall
Frodo looks at Page after page of beautiful Handwriting, with intricate Maps and Drawings
() 67
: (') This is wonderful
meant to go back
wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again
but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me
Frodo turns a page
there before him, is a map of the Shire
(quietly) miss the Shire
spent all my childhood pretending  was off somewhere else
off with you, on one of your adventures
(Looks at Bilbo) But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different
'm not like you, Bilbo
My dear boy
: -- Sam busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already full pack
pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes
No, what have  forgotten
Pull back to reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam
Packed already
Sam looks up, startled
(slightly embarrassed) No harm in being prepared
Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony
thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam
() 68
: do
More than anything
did
It's just
we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell
and  thought
seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon
Off home
You're right, Sam
Frodo looks at Sam
(') we did what we set out to do
Frodo opens his hand, the Ring sits in his Palm
(') The ring will be safe in Rivendell
am ready to go home
: ' ,  -- Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony, His strength returns
That wound will never fully heal
He will carry it the rest of his life
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring
the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil
It is a burden he should never have to had to bear
We can ask no more of Frodo
Gandalf, the enemy is moving
Sauron's forces are massing in the east
His eye is fixed on Rivendell
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us
Our list of allies grows thin
() 69
: His treachery runs deeper than you know
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men
he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard
An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed
Saruman is coming for the Ring
Elrond turns and walks away
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard
Gandalf
the ring cannot stay here
Gandalf turns and looks out the window
Sounds of arrivals
Gandalf watches as Boromir rides through Rivendell gate, followed by Legolas and Gimli
(
) (') This peril belongs to all Middle earth
They must decide how to end it
Not just for themselves but for those who come after
Elrond approaches Gandalf
(') The time of the Elves is over
My people are leaving these shores
Who will you look to when we have gone
The dwarves
They hide in their mountains seeking riches
They care nothing for the troubles of others
It is in Men that we must place our hope
Men
Men are weak
The race of Men is failing
The blood     of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten
It is because of men    the Ring survives
: With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger
Elrond reacts

) (') let Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the ring was forged: the one place it could be destroyed
: Cast it into the fire

:
No
Isildur turns and walks away Isildur
' ,  -- Elrond turns to Gandalf
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure
Isildur kept the Ring
and the line of Kings was broken
There's no strength left in the world of Men
They're scattered, divided, leaderless
() 71
: There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor
He turned from that path a long time ago
He has chosen exile
: ' ,  -- Strider watches from the shadows
as Boromir strolls through the darkened gallery
Boromir's eyes are drawn to an old Fresco on the wall
depicting Isildur defeating Sauron
Boromir looks with Wonderment at Narsil, the Broken Blade of Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth
(quiet awe) The shards of Narsil
the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand
Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade
Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir's finger
(') Still sharp
Boromir senses Strider's presence
he looks from the blade to Strider, as if sensing a connection
(') But no more than a broken heirloom
(') replaces the Broken blade, but it clatters to the floor
Boromir walks away, leaving Strider sitting alone
Close on: Strider picks up the broken hilt, as Arwen appears behind him
Why do you fear the past
You are Isildur's heir
not Isildur himself
You are not bound to his fate
The same blood flows in my veins
the same weakness

You will face the same evil
and you will defeat it

Strider looks down
In his hand lies the Evenstar

Arwen closes Strider's fingers around the jewel
Arwen leans towards Strider, gently kissing him
: ,  -- Elrond addresses the council
Strangers from distant lands
friends of old
You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction
None can escape it
You will unite
or you will fall
Each race is bound to this fate
this one doom
Frodo sits amongst a council of free-peoples of Middle earth, Elrond stands before them, addressing Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, Dwarves, and men
(') Bring forth the ring, Frodo
Frodo steps forward and moves towards a stone Plinth
He places the ring on the plinth and returns to his seat
(shocked) So it is true
(disbelief) Sauron's Ring
The ring of power
() 74
: (grim) The doom of man
It is a gift
a gift to the foes of Mordor
Why not use this Ring
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay
by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy
let us use it against him
You cannot wield it
None of us can
The one ring answers to Sauron alone
it has no other master
Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly
And what would a ranger know of this matter
Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively
stands
This is no mere Ranger
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn
You owe him your allegiance
Frodo looks at Strider questioningly
Boromir turns sharply
(quiet disbelief) Aragorn
This is Isildur's heir
And heir to the throne of Gondor
(Elvish: with subtitles) Havo dad, Legolas
Sit down, Legolas
Gondor needs no king
Aragorn is right
we cannot use it
You have only one choice
the ring must be destroyed

Gimli suddenly stands, excited
Then
what are we waiting for
Gimli suddenly rushes forward
He swings his axe down on the ring
The axe shatters with a deafening crack
Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring
unharmed
Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him
He slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead
Gandalf looks at him with concern
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we (') here possess
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom
only there can it be unmade
It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came
One of you must do this
Stunned silence
the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them
Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice One does not simply walk into Mordor
Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs
There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful
It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust
the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume
Not with ten thousand men could you do this
It is folly
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said
The ring must be destroyed
And  suppose you think you're the one to do it
And if we fail, what then
What happens when Sauron takes back what is his
Gimli leaps to his feet

(') (shouting) Never trust an Elf
:   fills the screen
streams of blood flow across the surface
flames flicker within the Gold Band
Do you not understand
While we    bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows
No one will escape it
You will   all be destroyed, your homes burnt and   your families put to the sword

breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision
With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring

Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces

Gandalf rises to his feet

If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which  note they have not,  would say we are taking the long way round
Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria
My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome
Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea
No, Gimli
would not take the road through Moria unless  had no other choice
Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand
Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground
Much laughter
Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind

He seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power
Aragorn warily approaches Boromir
Boromir is motionless

Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair

The Fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge

Aragorn shields Frodo and Sam as snow piles around them
Within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow
Boromir and Aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits

Make for the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city

Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones
Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees
slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone
Itidin

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards
revealing a blackness deeper than the night
As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs
-- The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria
a Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain
So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin
and they call this a Mine

Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights    the chamber
The Fellowship recoil in Horror
Many dwarf    Skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old    battle

The graves are despoiled
dwarf skeletons are strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried Dwarf blood
The Atmosphere is very sinister

each disappearing into dark tunnels
Gandalf pauses, frowning

The Fellowship are nervously waiting
while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him
He appears to be in some kind of trance

or was set loose
And now the Ring has drawn him here
he will never be rid of his need for it
He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself
Smeagol's life is a sad story
Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise
(') Yes
Smeagol he was once called
Before the ring came to him, before it drove him mad
Gollum's withered fingers are gripping the cave wall
he is large, Luminous eyes blinking with malice
() 90
: (2) (grim) It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance
Pity
It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand
Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life
Can you give it to them, Frodo
Frodo frowns
(') Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment
even the very wise cannot see all ends
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before this is over
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many
wish the ring had never come to me wish none of this had happened
So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us
There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice
(') There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil
Bilbo was meant to find the ring
In which case, you also were meant to have it
and that is an encouraging thought, (sudden brightness) Ah
That it's that way
Gandalf points at the right hand tunnel
the Fellowship scramble to their feet
(relieved) He's remembered
No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose
(laughs) Ye s

,  -- The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and empty space
Gandalf pauses
Let me risk a little more light
Gandalf taps his staff
for a brief moment a light blazes
like a silent Flash of Lightning
Great shadows spring up and flee
Behold
The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf
Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, polished and smooth as glass
Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake
Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed
Black arrows are embedded in the timbers
Two goblin skeletons lie in the doorway
Gimli rushes ahead
Gimli
: ' ,  -- Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber
lit with a narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the roof
Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high
In the far corner sits a stone walled Well
shaft of light falls directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white stone
Gimli falls to his knees
No
no
oh, no
Gimli sobs
Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the white stone slab
() 92
: "Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria
" He is dead, then
It's as  had feared
Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the white stone slab
It has been slashed and stabbed
and appears to be covered in Dried Blood
The pages crack and break as he opens it
(urgent whisper to Argorn) We must move on, we cannot linger
(reading) "They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates
but cannot hold them for long
the ground shakes
drums in the deep
we cannot get out
shadow moves in the dark
Will no- one save us
They are coming
" Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously
He stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton tumbling in
Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin before he falls
The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well
echoing loudly
-- Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin
(angry) Fool of a Took
Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity

They fall silent
low rolling boom rises from the depths below
growing louder
as if the caverns of Moria were turned into a vast drum
great horn blasts nearby
Answering horns
running feet
harsh cries
Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt

Frodo

cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard
Frodo draws the Sword
and stares at its glowing blade

Stay close to Gandalf
Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors
Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes
They have a cave troll
Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb
(yelling) Let them come
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath
The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll
Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets
Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords
Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle
The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn
who stumbles backwards
the huge club descends for the killing blow
suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood
Sam is backing up against a wall
a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other
In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan
It keels over
Sam looks surprised
He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops

The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear

Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down
Merry and Pippin jump on him
Legolas fires an arrow
and the cave troll topples, dead
Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor
Frodo appears to be dead
Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified
Suddenly Frodo coughs
takes a huge breath
He's alive
'm alright
'm not hurt
You should be dead
That spear would've skewered a wild boar
think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye
Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest
The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril
" Mithril

as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches
Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them
deafening roar fills the air
fiery light dances down the hallway
the pillars casting eerie shadows
The Goblins freeze
They back Fearfully away from the approaching beast
melting into the darkness
What is this new devilry

the ground shakes
an unearthly sound rumbles
(quietly) Balrog
a demon of the ancient world
This foe is beyond any of you

Quickly

In one hand is a blade
like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a of many thongs
Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway
Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff
Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned
Lead them on, Aragorn
The bridge is near
Aragorn hesitates
Gandalf looks at him
(') Do as  say; swords are no more use here
race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo
leaping across a gaping chasm
, spanning a bottomless pit
Gandalf yells to the others: Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm
Nobody tosses a dwarf
The  smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings

: -,  -- The Fellowship run into a hall
the floor is split with fissures that spit flame
(yelling) Over the bridge
Fly
They race towards the slender bridge of stone
without kerb or rail
at the far end of the hall
The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge
but Gandalf
the last
pauses in the middle of the span
he faces the Balrog
staff in one hand
Sword in the other
Frodo looks back in horror: (') You cannot pass
(alarmed yell) Gandalf
(yelling) am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun
Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to Full Height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall
Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge
(') Go back to the shadow
The  slashes at Gandalf with its Sword of flame
Gandalf blocks with his sword

a blinding sheet of white flame springs up
the staff shatters
the bridge breaks
right at Balrog's feet
The stone bridge drops away into the gulf
from under the Balrog
For a moment, the great Beast remains poised in the air
then it plunges down: in slow motion Relief floods Frodo's face
Gandalf remains trembling on the lip of the broken bridge
Slow motion: As the Balrog falls, he lashes out with his whip of fire
Slow motion: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around Gandalf's knees, dragging him over the brink
Gandalf just manages to hand on by his fingertips (screaming) Gandalf
(fierce) Fly, you fools
: Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away
following the Balrog into the bottomless Abyss
Frodo cries out
Boromir scoops him up and carries him away
No
Gandalf
They rush towards an archway
: -- The Fellowship tumble out of the Great Eastern Gate on to a grassy sunlit hillside
Sam, Merry, and Pippin fall slowly to the ground, Sobbing
Aragorn turns to Legolas and Gimli
(urgent) Legolas, get them up
Give them a moment
for pity's sake
By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs
We must reach the woods of Lothlorien
Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up

in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen
Lothlorien
-- : The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers
above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars
the trunks of huge, grey trees
Gimli looks nervously around
Stay close, young hobbits
they say a Sorceress lives in these woods
An elf- witch of terrible power
All who look upon her fall under her spell
Frodo hesitates

(
) Frodo
And are never seen again

We need your protection

These woods are perilous
We should go back
You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood
You cannot go back
Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo
(') Come, she is waiting
: -- Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top
They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them
Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of the woods
Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others
Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City
It Gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun
green, gold, and silver
To the east of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale gleam of Anduin, the great river
Beyond the River, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall
The Sun that lies on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond
: ' ,   -- 100
: step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light
The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown
Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests
His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it
Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves
She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty
Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn
Eight there are, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell
Tell me, where is Gandalf, for  much desire to speak with him
Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn
(
) (softly aloud) he has fallen into shadow
Galadriel looks to Aragorn
(') The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife
Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all
Yet hope remains while the company is true
Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam
(') Do not let your hearts be troubled
Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil
Galadriel's eyes turn to Frodo
her voice fades

(sadly) lament for Gandalf
What do they say about him
have not the heart to tell you
For me, the grief is still too near
Boromir is sitting alone
Aragorn approaches him
Take some rest
these borders are well protected
Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face
Aragorn kneels down beside him

The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze
have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets

" Aragorn returns Boromir's smile
betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away
: The Fellowship are asleep on their beds
Gimli is snoring loudly

: Frodo's eyes flicker open
as if by instinct
, her White dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him
Frodo follows her
as if drawn by an invisible force
: ,  -- Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow Silver Basin
Galadriel leads Frodo into the small Glade
Will you look into the mirror
Frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin
(warily) What will  see
Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug
a glow rises from the water
Even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things
things that were
things that are
and some things that have not yet come to pass
Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal
he peers     into the glossy surface
The night sky is reflected into     the water
suddenly a figure takes form
the bowed figure     of an old man, clad in white robes
He walks down a long      road
Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface
103
:
gasps, his face lighting up with hope
(joyous) Gandalf
Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity
Frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror
Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white
The vision shifts
Frodo gasps in horror
The Shire is in ruins
The image suddenly widens to fill the screen
buildings burning
bodies strewn about
Dark Shapes of  looting and destroying
Bag End, billowing in flames
The Party tree is hacked down
Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow
the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely
: Hobbiton
now an Industrial wasteland
The fields and trees destroyed
replaced with Brick factories belching smoke
:  brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the Factories
We see Sam
Merry
and Rosie Cotton
Soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole
Suddenly, the mirror goes dark
and out of the black abyss a single eye grows
:
Unable to move or cry out
The ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water
not shimmering with curls of steam
Fire erupts around the eye
With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground
Light instantly fades from the mirror
Frodo comes to his senses
he is shocked
Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror
know what it is you saw
for it is also in my mind
It is the future, Frodo
It is what will come to pass if you should fail
Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely
Frodo looks down
in his hand he is clutching the ring
Frodo looks up at Galadriel
(') The fellowship is breaking
It has already begun
He will try to take the ring
You know of whom  speak
One by one, it will destroy them all
(
) If you ask it of me,  will give you the One Ring
() 104
: You offer it to me freely
do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this
Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's eyes
Frodo is suddenly afraid of her
(') In place of the Dark Lord, you would have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Dawn
Treacherous as the Sea
Stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair
Frodo takes a step away from Galadriel
Galadriel suddenly laughs
a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad
(') (gently) pass the test
(laughs) will diminish and go into the west and remain Galadriel
Frodo's confidence drains away
cannot do this alone
You are the ring-bearer, Frodo
to bear a ring of power is to be alone
This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will
Frodo realizes what her message is
Then  know what  must do
It's just
'm afraid to do it
Galadriel kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at him intently
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future
The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand

Aragorn's head snaps round

as he realizes Boromir has gone
-- Frodo is walking beneath the trees
lost in thought
His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab

So much depends on you

You suffer,  see it day by day

Frodo stands silent for a moment

There are other ways, Frodo

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself up

But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have

No
Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir
Why do you recoil

What chance do you think you have

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring

Forgive me,  did not see
have failed you all
No, Boromir
You fought bravely
You have kept your honor
Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound
Leave it
It is over
the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin
Aragorn
do not know what strength is in my blood, but  swear to you
will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail
Our people
our people
Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand
Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt
(') would have followed you, my brother
my captain, my King
Aragorn lays Boromir down
He is dead
Be at peace, son of Gondor
Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir's forehead

: (3) (') Legolas and Gimli appear behind him
Aragorn stands
(') They will look for his coming from the white tower
but he will not return
-- On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish Boats, the ring in his palm
distraught Sam
running as hard as he can through the forest
Mr
Frodo
Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river
the camera moves in on the ring
(
) wish the ring had never come to me wish none of this had happened
Tears fall down Frodo's face
(
) So do all who lie to see such times
but that is not for them to decide
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us
With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket
The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish boat into the water
Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake
Frodo is already paddling away
(anguished) Not alone, Frodo
Mr
Frodo
Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the shore
tears in his eyes
the voice of Sam carried on the wind
Frodo whispers to himself No, Sam
Sam looks at the water
then at the boat
turns to see Sam launching himself into the water
() 116
: (') Go back,Sam
'm going to Mordor alone
Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat
Of course you are
and 'm coming with you
You can't swim
Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing
Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat
(') (frightened) Sam
Sam is underwater
hands flailing helplessly as he sinks
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's
Frodo pulls a bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat
Frodo and Sam look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming down both their faces
made a promise, Mr
Frodo
a promise
(fierce passion) "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee
" (sobs) And  don't mean to
don't mean to
(crying) Oh, Sam
Frodo starts to laugh through his tears
the two friends hug
(') Come on then
The two Hobbits row through the water
-- Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing water
Boromir's body slides under camera
He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest
his broken horn at his side
Suddenly
the boat drops away from camera
as it plunges over the massive falls of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below
() 117
: If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall
Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and Sam make off into the forest beyond
He doesn't react
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn
(') You mean not to follow them
Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands
Then it has all been in vain
the fellowship has failed
Not if we hold true to each other
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have strength left
Aragorn pulls a   out of his pack and straps it on
(') Leave all that can be spared behind
:
a steely light in his eye
(') (grimly) We travel light
Let's hunt some Orc
Yes
Ha
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods, following the - trail
-- Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge
distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark, oppressive sky
Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains
() 118
: Mordor
hope the others find a safer road
(simply) Strider'll look after them
don't suppose we'll ever see them again
We may yet, Mr
Frodo
We may
Sam
Frodo looks at Sam with great affection
despite the grim outlook, Sam is undeterred
(') 'm glad you're with me
