Oh, God

His eyes glaze over as he remembers : 6		   -  -  - is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her
(
) The end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure
Rico, pay attention
The teacher  , 38, a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused
Sorry, Mr
Rasczak
But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen
Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since
You know these facts but have  taught you anything of value
You
Why are only citizens allowed to vote
Rasczak points at , 17, with his stump It's a reward
what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service
Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience
No
Something given has no value
Haven't  taught you dimwits anything
guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential
Laughter
Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape: Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship
When you vote, you're exercising political authority
You're using force
And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives
, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in
Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr
Rasczak
Laughter
Rasczak grins
In my classroom, you bet
Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree
The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it
, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in
My mother always says that violence never solves anything
Really
wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that
You
Rasczak points at Carmen
They probably wouldn't say anything
Hiroshima was destroyed
Johnny presses  "" on his desk, and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen
Correct
Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor
The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst
While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus
People who forget that always pay
They pay with their lives and their freedom
Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face
So does Rasczak
He points at him with his stump, snaps Johnny to
You
Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue
citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life
The civilian does not
The exact words of the text
But do you understand it
Do you believe it
Uh,  don't know
Of course you don't
doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass
bell rings
Rasczak shrugs, indifferent
Well, that's it
Have a nice life
7		   -  -  - walk with their friends
Several  hold hands
Johnny tries to take Carmen's hand, but she demurs
Johnny broods
'mon, let's see if they've posted the math final test yet
Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla
How should  know
You're captain of the team
8		 -  - join other students around a -
First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores
Wish me luck
Carmen enters her name, receives her score:	97%
She beams
Good for you
Your turn
Then she spots Carl across the way talking with , 17
Hold on
wanna talk to Marco
His sister's at Fleet
Carmen rushes off
Johnny checks his score:	35%
Crushed, he makes sure no none else has seen
Carl walks up to him
You still haven't kissed her yet
Don't lie
What's the hurry
Others are waiting
Carl points out Dizzy, talking with friends
Did you read her mind
Don't have to
Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss
It's true
You can tell by the way she looks at Johnny
Yeah, but  want Carmen
You got it bad
Carmen returns to Johnny as Carls heads off
Don't forget about this afternoon
(to Carmen) He's always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss
Carmen blushes, covers
She's flying starships
Who
Marco's sister
Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes
You gotta have nerves of steel
Reflexes are critical have good reflexes
Carmen notices the way Dizzy's looking at Johnny, doesn't like it one bit, takes Johnny's arm
'mon Johnny, we'll be late for Biology
9		   --  - is an older woman, very spry, also blind
Johnny, Carmen and other students gather around covered lab tables
For our final today, please identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit, locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia
You may begin
The students remove the cover to reveal large alien bugs, 60 centimeter    laid out for dissection
Eeuch
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug
Just a bug, eh
We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement
'm afraid it isn't true
This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways
It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society
Better put your goggles on
Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser
Green fluid sprays from the slit
Carmen turns away looking ill
Our galaxy is teaming with insect life
We have identified over two billion species so far
Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly
But we 're intelligent
Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel
True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society
She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall
They are relatively stupid by human standards
Workers have an  of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets
Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space
Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack
Bug guts gush out
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal
Excuse me
She heads for the door, hand over her mouth
10		  -  - walk home from school together
35% on the math final
No one could be that dumb with numbers
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug
How embarassing
Who cares about bugs
You can't go anywhere if you don't know math
Don't be so sure
like you even if you are dumb with numbers
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school
don't want everyone to see
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone
How come that's all you talk about anymore
It's all  think about anymore
Indeed, they are all alone now
The look in Johnny's eye says how about it
Carmen grins, reaches for Johnny's hand
11		  -  - and Johnny stand together near a bank of
You can't walk me home
Why not
thought you were going to help Carl
Carl can wait
Johnny, my Dad's home today
Johnny's face darkens with frustration
What's he got against me
mean,  'm a teenager
You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager
It's not you, Johnny
Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad
He's a veteran
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends
Sometimes  do what  want, eh
Carmen steps into the flux
She's gone
Johnny grins, happy to be in love
12		'  -  -  - is hard-wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise Carl's basement workshop
Carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor
Don't think about it
go on instinct
Ace of spades
The ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match"
Carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves 'm unlucky
Two of hearts
Wrong again
Luck is not a factor
No one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't
Federal studies like this might provide a clue
The next card up is the nine of clubs
wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking
Four of spades
Suddenly,     jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor
Johnny removes the blindfold
Cyrano, you big yellow turd
Johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck
He just wants attention
You don't play with him like you used to
Carl concentrates for a moment
Go bug Mom, Cyrano
Cyrano's eyes widen
He hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time
Carl clears the screen
How do you make him do that
gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg
He is going to go eat it
From upstairs, '  shrieks
(
) Get out
Get out
Carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me
Don't be afraid
Can't do humans
yet
'mon let's go
Carl, puts up more cards, Johnny misses them all
Ten of clubs
You still gonna sign up for Starside &
Passport to the Universe
Who wouldn't want that
've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too
Fleet, maybe
Your father will never let you
'm eighteen
It's my decision,  think 'd make a pretty good pilot
've good great reflexes
You need that for maneuvering, you know
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation
So what do you think your chances are
Eight point
no, uh, seven
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance
All  know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and  don't think it'll work out for us if 'm not
Love
how excruciatingly pathetic
Now try and pay attention
Carl puts a card up
Queen of hearts
The computer indicates a match
Johnny peers around at the monitor
It is the Queen of hearts
Well, what do you know about that
13		  -  -  - and other students wearing orange and black sing the "Uni High Song"
The  says:
Across the field, fans wear red and gold and sing another song
14		  -  - and other   , all exceptionally robust young man and women, suit up in their orange and black uniforms
Tesla's tough
They tumble good and they hit
Dizzy bounces a   to Johnny
The spring fires and vaults it high into the air
Johnny catches it, puts it on, smiles cocky at the   who suit up in red and gold
We tumble good, too
15		  -  -
-- collide
Powered by jump shoes, the play is gymnastic
Johnny moves the ball , flips high in the air over the Giant defensive line, makes ten meters before he is brought down
16		 -  - cheers as Johnny runs back to join his team
He sees Carmen waving, glad that Johnny has seen her among all the people
17		 -  - and other Tigers listen as quarterback Dizzy calls the plays
Kick three, fade left
On two
They make fists, then breal for thevline of scrimmage
18		  -  - have the ball
The Giant's QUARTERBACKassigns  , 18, handsome, super-confident, to guard Johnny
Time's running out
Zander points
The  shows	 19,	 20, three minutes and counting on the clock
Johnny grins
lot can happen in three minutes
Hut
hut
Johnny takes the handoff, flips over a gauntlet of Giant guards
Zander hurls himself at Johnny, misses
Johnny scores
Zander tumbles into the crowd, loses a jump shoe
19		 - - looks up and sees Carmen, smiling as she offers him a hand
She helps him up
He holds her hand longer than necessary
Are you alright
'm getting better
20		  -  - runs back to join his team as the crowd cheers
The Tigers lead 21-20
Johnny frowns when he sees Carmen talking to Zander on the sidelines, shaking his head, smiling
21		 -  - finds his shoe, straps it on
So what are you doing later
Everyone is going to the dance
Aren't you
don't know
It's my last night as acivilian
ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow
Zander heads for the field
Carmen follows, interested
You're going to the Academy
That's where  want to go
'd love to talk to you abou that
blows his whistle at Zander, signalling impatiently
'm all ears
Don't you have to finish the game
22		  - - are in possession
Zander lands hard in front of Johnny
Don't get any ideas
She's my girl
You can never be sure
Johnny scowls at Zander, turns his head to look back at Carmen
She waves, smiling
The Giants pull ablitz
Zander knocks Johnny on his ass, and the Giants score
It's 21,  22 and less than a minute to go
23		 --  -- orders up the next play
Johnny keeps looking over his shoulder because Zander's back talking to Carmen again
Flip six, three hole
Rico
Hey
Dizzy slams Johnny upside his helmet with her forearm
What
You were drifting
Flip six, three hole
On one, got it
Just throw me the ball, Diz
They make fists and break
24		  --  -- takes position again across the line from Zander who now grins at Johnny broadly
Johnny  doesn't grin back
Hut
At the snap, Johnny breaks for open field
Dizzy throws, Johnny catches it, trips Zander up painfully, and hurls himself into the end zone as a horn sounds the game's finish
25		  -  - rush onto the field as the school band strikes up a victory march
Tigers do flips in the air
Giants look dejected
Zander picks himself up, watches Johnny leave with Carmen
26		'  -  - walks throuh rooms filled with elegant furniture
He's all spiffed up for the big dance
His  catches him preening in front of a mirror by the  in the hall
Who said you could grow up so fast
Last time checked you were only five years old
You had such a bright little face
Aw, don't get mushy
Johnny's  enters carrying a
This came for you today
presume on your request
lot of my friends are doing Federal Service
You aren't thinking of applying
Johnny shrugs
Have you lost you lost your mind
'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life
It's aterm of service, not a career
just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years
Johnny, people get hurt
people get killed in the Federal Service
If something happened to you  don't know what  would do
Who gave you this idea
It's that teacher
What's his name
You know the one mean
Mr
Rasczak
Rasczak
Silly name
There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station
No, Mr
Rasczak doesn't do that at all
He sorta discourages you really
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it
'm eighteen
It's my decision
Oh, is that how it is
Wait you two
Dad and  have a surprise for you that will settle this
Can you guess what it is
Uh, no
trip to the Outer Rings
Whad'ya think of that
Wow
Santori and Zegema Beach, 've always wanted to go there
Good good, then it's all settled
year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives
Wait a minute
Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior
He's the smartest kid at school
Sorry
Carl's a fine boy
Johnny puts on his jacket
don't know what they teach at Harvard, but  think 'm pretty good enough the way  am
Johnny, please
Calm yourself
Well, that's what you're saying
You're saying that 'm not good enough the way am now
Johnny stomps out, the transporter goes
Why did you go and do that
He was all ready to go Zegema Beach
Teenagers
27		   -  - at the "Farewell Dance" is dressed up
Rasczak and other chaperon
spotlight finds the
Alright, everybody, this is the last dance, so let's turn down the lights and make it a slow one
The lights go down
Dizzy, dressed pretty, brightens when she sees Johnny standing alone near the dance floor
Hey, Rico, wanna dance
Actually, Diz,  promised Carmen
Too bad for her if she's not around
Dizzy pulls him onto the floor, holds him close
You know, it's sad
Most of us probably won't see each other again after tonight
There is an invitation here
Johnny doesn't take it
You still gonna play for Brazil
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky
How come we never got together
Dizzy looks at Johnny meaningfully
He's distracted
Carmen crosses the room, stunning in her formal
Can't we just be friends, Diz
Sure
Uh, look, Diz
Guess you gotta go
You're the best
Johnny heads for Carmen
Dizzy watches jealously as Carmen takes his hand
She looks around for someone to dance with
Carl, a nerd in a tux, waves shyly
28		 -   -  - dance
Johnny wants to kiss her, Carmen playfully avoids
Isn't it great to be in love
How do  know if this is love
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't
Outa the way you two
Carl and Dizzy dance by, Dizzy smiling bravely because Carl is a terrible dancer
Johnny goes in for the kiss again
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation
Aw, you're in love with me
You just dont know it yet
Johnny's confidence makes her smile
Johnny moves in to kiss her, but the music ends
Everyone applauds
The lights come up and people head for the doors
Johnny sees Rasczak
Wait,  want to talk to Mr
Rasczak
'll meet you outside
Johnny heads over to Rasczak
Mister Rasczak
What is it, Rico
just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class had this year
(smiling) Well, it's not really my job to please
Hope you learned something
wanna join up, Mr
Rasczak
think have what it take to be a citizen
Good for you
Go find out
Well, my parents are against it, and know it's my choice, but  was wondering
What would you do if you were me
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has
Use that freedom
Make your own choice, Rico
29		   -  - walks out and finds Carmen talking with Zander
He wears the blue uniform of a Fleet pilot trainee
Carmen examines his  , a pair of silver wings
Johnny, this is Zander
Yeah, we know each other from the game
No hard feeling, eh, chum
None at all
We won
Good luck at the academy
Zander takes back the wings and pins the to his tunic
Always
30		 -  - walk together along the river holding hands
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy
Isn't that great
Yeah, sure,  guess
No,  mean if he can get in, maybe  have a chance
What are you talking about
We both know you're gonna be a pilot
Zander is going for pilot, too
You two have so much in common
Carmen pulls Johnny to a stop, looks him in the eye
Johnny Rico, you're jealous
can't help it
He's nothing like you
don't even know if you're my girl
Carmen smiles, leans in close to Johnny
Are you the boy for me
'm gonna do it, Carmen
'm gonna sign up for Federal Service
They kiss, tentatively, but the passion grows and they break apart, breathless
Oh, Johnny
31		  -  - making out as they wait their turn
There are a few other people around including a
Everyone's looking
we shouldn't
Who cares
You're right
Let's never stop
Hey, you, there's a place for that
Without stopping, Johnny pulls Carmen into the flux
32		  -  - kissing at her front door
Johnny moves his hand tenatively to Carmen 's breast
She takes his hand, smiling, puts it under her shirt
love you, Carmen
Shhh
She puts her mouth on his and they melt together
The door flies open, and '  stands there
' Carmen, it's late
Get inside
Sorry, Dad
See you, Johnny
Carmen ducks inside
Her father looks Johnny over
He carries a terrible battle scar oon his face
' don't want you around Carmen anymore
Get me
Maybe Carmen's gonna make her own decisions from now on, Mr
Ibanez
Carmen's Dad reddens
He'd like to punch Johnny out
' Carmen's gonna be a citizen
She don't need you and your rich family
The Federation'll give her everything she needs
(
) Dad, leave him alone
Carmen's Dad slams the door in Johnny's face
33		  -  - meet Carl in front of the induction center where a staedy flow of prospective citizens file through the main doors
34		 -  - is missing one arm
He smiles broadly at the three teenagers
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh
That's us
Where do we sign
He turns in his chair to grab the forms
Johnny and his friends see that he is also missing both legs
The Recruiting Sergeant catches them looking, smiles even wider
Here and here and here
As he signs, Johnny looks at the campaign ribbons on the Recruiting Sergeant's chest
We hear : 	"The Mobile Infantery Anthem" plays softly in honor of distant battles
Welcome to the adventure of Federal Service
Follow the blue line
35		  -  - , are routed into different lines, joining other hopeful civilians
makes a speech over the loudspeaker
There is no guarantee of service
We don't need all of you
It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful tasks
Many jobs are hazardous to your health
If you are chosen and do not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form 1240/
Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights
36		  --  -- and others in the line strip down
The guy in front of Johnny is , 18, athletic and cheerful
They took my sister, they'll take anybody
37		  --  -- grimaces as a  installs an   on his side, drawing fluids
Oh, this is the part that hurts
sits down across from each candidate
No talking please
'm going to ask you some questions
Please answer all questions truthfully
We'll know if you don't
Birthplace
Here in Buenos Aires
The Psych Officer checks Johnny's response on a meter
38		   -  - is poked and prodded, subjected to aural, visual and pharmacological stimuli, and scanned from head to toe
(
) Are your parents currently citizens
(
) No, sir
(
) Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence
(
) Courage,  guess
(
) Please complete this sentence
want to be citizen because
(
) want to be a citizen because
well, because of my girl, sir
39		 -  - sits across from a  who views a list on a monitor Johnny can't see
'm happy to tell you that you've been accepted for Federal Service
Wow, that's great
Looks like you're quite an athlete
Boy, look at those reaction stats
The Major clucks his tongue as he highlights the last category on his list: My job is to dertermine what you're best suited for
want to be a pilot, sir
Sorry, son, no way
Your school records say you don't have the math skills
Johnny swallows this
He knew it was coming
The Major deletes "Pilot" from the list, then several other items
That rules out the scientific and engineering applications, and 'm afraid we reserve non-military options for candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son
He turns the monitor around and shows Johnny the list
The only thing left is
It looks like the only thing you're good for is cannon fodder
'm putting you down for the Mobile Infantery
40		 -  - proudly takes the Federal Service oath with about twenty-five other people, a gleaming silver   on her chest
She looks around for Johnny, sees him grinning at her
of my own free will, without promise, coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much longer as may be required by the needs of the Service
41		  -  -  - walk out together happily, hand in hand
wonder where Carl is
You don't suppose
Naw,  made it, Carl made it
Just then, Don rushes past, shamefaced, crying
He was in the group with me
guess he didn't
Shhh
Don't make him feel worse
The Recruiting Sergeant is getting ready to go home
He's got legs now, and he takes a prosthetic arm from its case and snaps it on
He grins when he sees them staring
They put me out front to discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day  go home
How'd you kids do
'm gonna go for pilot
Good for you
We need every pilot we can get
Johnny holds the door for Carmen and the Recruiting Sergeant
Suddenly Carl appears looking a little paler than usual
Hey, Carl, what's wrong
Did you get Starside &
No
42		  -  - are stunned
don't believe it
got Games & Theory
Well, everyone's a little impressed by this
Games & Theory
That's Military Intelligence
Oh, Carl
Whoa
Way to go, boy-yo
Next time we meet, 'll probably have to salute you
What about you, son
Infantery, sir
The Recruiting Sergeant beams, offers a prosthetic hand
Well, good for you
The Mobile Infantery made me the man  am today
Just what Johnny wanted to hear
They watch the old Sergeant walk away
:	"The Mobile Infantery Theme"
Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the arm as they walk
Let's all make a vow
Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what
'll go for that
Well, we're gonna be millions of light years away from each other, and chances are we'll never see each other again, but sure
can't wait to tell my Dad 'm in
He's gonna be so happy
My father's probably gonna kill me
43		'  -  -  - stands sullenly as his Father rages at him
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it
It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer
won't quit
'm telling you, you will
You're not going back
You're going to go on vacation
'm not going on vacation
want to be acitizen
It's my decision
made it
Johnny turns for the door
His father throws his last shot
You walk out that door, you're cut off, young man
You understand me
Alright, ' , '
44		'  -  - -- walks out, grim, sees his mother, tears in her eyes
(
) Johnny, why won't you change your mind
Does citizenship mean so much to you
Well, yeah, sure
hope so
hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform
Johnny's face reddens
Don't talk about my girl that way
Johnny turns on his heel, heads for the transporter
45		   -  - looks for Carmen among hundreds of young people bound for Federal Service destinations
Recruits wear civilian clothes
Everyone else is in uniform
(
) Outbound group 1380, Ursa Minor and Tyko, now transporting at bank 17
Now he sees her entering struggling with luggage
Johnny rushes to help her and soon he is carrying all her bags
You're late
My Dad had to help me pack
Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something
It was sweet, but it took forever
Anyway,  guess 'm ready to go
At the freight station, Carmen enters her Federal
card and gets numbered tags for her bags
Me, too
'm wearing everything  own
Johnny loads them onto a conveyor belt
Poor boy
'm sorry your parents were so mad
Who cares
The Federation'll give me everything need for the next two years, right
Carmen's already moved to the next line
Johnny follows
You talk to Carl
He left this morning
He couldn't say where
Carmen logs in, enters her destination:	 - The tickets station spits out a pass
It's exciting, but it's scary, too isn't it
Going someplace new where you don't know anyone
Carmen heads toward a bank of transporters
Johnny stops her, takes her by the arms
'm gonna miss you
'll miss you, too, Johnny
love you
(
) Outbound group 948A, Tereshkova, all sections, transporting at bank 5
Oh, that's me
She scans her pass, but Johnny stops her again
Com'on, just say it
Try it on for size
Alright,  love you
Carmen kisses him, jumps into the transporter
Do you mean it
said it
Isn't that enough
Don't forget to write
The last thing he sees are her beautiful eyes

He addresses sixty shorn
The problem with you is that none of you are good enough the way you are
Johnny stands in formation with his squad, among them: , 18, ', 19,  McINTIRE, 18,  , 18, , 18, and  , 18
am your senior drill instructor, Career Sergeant Zim
(then) What a bunch of apes
No, strike that
You don't rate that good
you sunken-chested, slack-bellied, drooling refugees from apron strings
In my whole life 've never seen such a disgraceful huddle of momma's spoiled little darlings
Suck in those guts
You there,
Zim gives Kitten Smith the hairy eyeball
Smith cracks up
Do you think 'm funny
Do  make you laugh
Do you think 'm a comedian
Kitten Smith shake his head  "no" , but he can't stifle himself
Sorry
The first and last words out of your stinking holes will be "sir"
Do you get me
Sir, sorry
sir
See the armory
Run around it
Kitten Smith squints
Out in the distance, a tiny building
Zim smacks him on the leg with his baton
,
Bronski, keep pace
Kitten Smith runs
Big  , 28, takes out after him, laying a baton across his backside every time he slows
You are now all brothers and sisters in the same family, my family, the Mobile Infantery
will be your mother
will be your father
If you do not please me  will throw you out of my family because  hate all slackers and negative hackers
Do you get me
Sir, yes, sir
Zim points at the little    leading to a transporter near the front gate
Anytime you think 'm being to tough, anytime you think 'm being unfair
Grab your gear and take a stroll down "Washout Lane"
Get me
Sir, yes, sir
wonder if there's a handful of guts in the whole bunch
Who thinks they've got what it takes to knock me down
Breckinridge, a big guy from a farm planet, steps forward
Sir,  guess maybe  do, sir
Zim crooks afinger at him
Breckinridge charges
Zim knocks him flat
Breckinridge holds his arm, twisted now
You alright, Breckinridge
Sir, yes, sir
It's my arm
think it's broken, sir
charges up, checks Breckinridge's arm, grins
Clean break
Doc'll have him back on active duty by tomorrow
Good
Who's next
Shujumi steps up, assumes a fighting stance
Zim looks him over
There's not not much to him
Shujumi attacks Zim, counters his counter, dances out of range
' Lookit the little guy go
Now Zim attacks
Shujumi flip kicks Zim in the head
He's good alright
'll bet he makes squad leader
He'll have to get past me
The recruits check Ace out
Zim sweeps Shujumi's legs, puts a knee in the little man's throat
Shujumi passes out
51		  -  - tumble a brutal obstacle course using
(
) Some of you may not  make it
Djana'd hits a tower and falls to the deck hard, dropping her rifle
She holds her knee, hurt
Zim races over to her
Zim begins to kick her because she doesn't move fast enough
(
) You might think  am unfair
52		   -  - watch poor Kitten Smith spar with Zim
Kitten Smith whacks Zim across the jaw
Zim doesn't even flinch
Is that all you got
You hit like kitten, Smith
This is a punch
Zim knocks Kitten Smith for a loop
(
) You will not like me
53		   -  - watches the recruits face simulated 3- -
In one room, of Antilles, in another, red  , and in a third, screeching
(
) But if you survive you will thank me because you will be born again hard
You will be a new person
You will be a Cap Trooper
And then, , you'll  be good enough
54		   -  - throws a knife, buries the point in a narrow post
(
) to serve in my family
Sir,  don't understands who needs a knife in a nuke fight anyway
All you gotta do is push a button, sir
Zim yanks the knife out of the post
Put your hand on the post, private
Ace obeys
Zim throws, sticks his hand to the post
The enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand
Zim pays no attention to Ace who remains stuck to the post recruit trots up
Johnny stares, surprised
It's Dizzy
Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty , sir
She snaps Zim a salute and hands him her orders
see you specifically requested transfer from Fort Cronkite to this training group
Dizzy grins self-consciously at Johnny
Sir,  heard it was the best, sir
It is the best '
,
Dizzy hits the deck and starts doing push-ups, counting off as arrive and go to work on Ace's hand
55		  -  - line up for mess piled four-square together on a single plate, meat on the bottom, ice cream on top
'd like to disable Zim
Improper Attitude
They'll kick you out for talking like that
' They can kick you out for anything
Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory Performance
Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye
Ace cuts into the front off the mess line
Aw, you either got what it takes or you don't
' 'mon Ace, wait your turn
At ease, soldier
It's all the same muck
Better get in line like everyone else, Ace
Silence
There could be a fight
Zim, standing nearby, watches with interest
Ace opens his hand
You got some guts for a rich kid
guess you and me could be buddies
What an honor
Hey, don't laugh
Everyone oughta have a friend like me
Ace makes a big friendly show of trading places with Johnny
Come on, Ace, back off the line
Bacl off the line
Now everyone's laughing, pushing Ace to the back of the line
Johnny has his grub
Dizzy comes up with her tray
Hey, amigo, come chow with me
No thanks, Diz
What's your malfunction, Rico
You are
joined up to get out on my own
And you had to tag along
What
You think  joined the Mobile Infantery because of you
You saying you didn't
Johnny turns away
Dizzy watches him go, hurt
56		  -  - tumble down the difficult course in their power suits
At the head of the pack , breathing hard, Johnny and Ace race
What makes you think
you'll make
squad leader, Rico
Something
've got
you don't
You rich kids
are all the same
It isn't about rich
It's about who's best
They come to a trap, prepare to leap
Coming through
Dizzy jumps over them from behind
Johnny and Ace tumble into the mud
They watch, chagrined, as Dizzy reaches the end of the course effortlessly
'mon, move it, you apes
57		 -  - enters as the recruits scrub down
We all have one thing in common
We were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infanterie
What's your excuse, Breckinridge
Well, my family is all farmers
hate farming
Mobile Infantery's pure picnic by comparison
So the grow 'em big and dumb on the farm planet, eh
Djana'd
' 'm going in for politics
You gotta be a citizen for that
So here  am
'mon, keep it going
Katrina
wanna be a mom
It's easier to get a licence if you've served
'm going career
officer's training
That's why  wanna be squad leader
They look for that
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job
Oh, yeah
don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead
Well, maybe you better look again
Federation's gonna give me a scholarship when my hitch is up
wanna be a neurologist, study brain chemisty and associated stimulus
Dizzy dresses down
Johnny and all the other guys check her out
She has a fabulous body
Dizzy cathes Johnny looking
He turns his back as she steps into the shower next to him
Your turn, Rico
Aw, who asked you to be so nosey
Me,  got plans to be writer, and a writer's got a right to be nosey
Flores, you know Rico from Buenos Aires
What's his story
Dizzy uses her hand to divert the shower spray towards Johnny's crotch
Well, some say he turned his back on the family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl
missed a spot there, bucko
which is funny because Johnny says  joined up to be with him, but why would  do that
He doesn't even like me
Don't look that way to me
Everyone look down at Johnny's crotch, laughing
Johnny blushes, grabs a towel and exits the shower
58	  -  -   - pans the barracks with a little handcam, neat bunks in a row, other recruits lounging around in their skivvies
know it's not much, but it's home
Over there's my bunk where  dream about you every night
Ace, Kitten Smith, Shujumi and Breckinridge dance around and moon the camera
Hey, do you mind
Johnny moves the camera away from the guys
Katrina walks by from the shower with Dizzy, mugs into frame
Hey, what's going on
bet it's that girl  was talking about
Her name's Carmen,  think
Carmen
Ooh la la, Carmencita
Hi, Carmen
Johnny heads for the door
Hey, where you going
Come back
He's getting awy
Grab him
The picture goes all screwy, comes up again on: 59		 -  -   - talk quietly now outside the barracks door
Boot's pretty tough, and sometimes think  won't make it, but then imagine you're watching me, and that gives me someting
try harder
Thanks to you,  think  might have a shot at squad leader
The barracks lights go out
Taps plays over the public address
Johnny lowers his voice
Uh-oh,  gotta pack it in
hope you're having fun, hope you're careful
No training accidents for you, eh
(leaning into camera) want to kiss you so badly
want to feel you next to me, - Behind him , someone begins to sing , badly
love you truly, so truly, dear
Ace, the singer, and the other guys peer down from the transom over the door, giggling, delighted with themselves
: 60		   -  - watches the end of Johnny's letter
Ace continues to sing
Our love will grow, dear, year by year
Bye
Write me
'm gonna kill you guys
The letter ends
Carmen smiles
smacks her on the arm as she runs by in a sleek blue pressure suit
Orbit in five, Ibanez
First one there gets to fly
Grinning, Carmen grabs her duffel, takes off after her
61		  -  - and the bald cadet race for the hatch past other recruits
62		 -  - gets there first, jumps into the pilot seat
The Bald Pilot takes second seat
Looking it down
Two   duck in through the closing hatch door
Oh no, not Ibanez again, she's crazy
On my mark, in three, two, one
63		  - straeks upward from the lunar floor past orbitting training platforms where in brightly colored pressure suits float against the Earth which hangs beyond the horizon
(
) 64		 -   - blasts past a  orbiting in dock, zips between and other slower fleet traffic in the crowded space lanes of Luna
The two late cadets are terrified
Geez,  thought  liked to fly fast
This is nothing
Today,  get to fly that
She points
Now visible from behind a host of smaller ships, , of older design, but impressive
65		 -    -   - arrives on the bridge, dark, cramped, all-business
She salutes the instructor, , 40s
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am
Take the number one chair, Ibanez
Follow all instructions of you supervisor
Yes, ma'am
Carmen turns for her station, but stops in her tracks
Her supervisor is Zander Barcalow, now a 2nd Lieutenant
Hey
What are you doing here
'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate
Carmen logs on
The ship recognizes her as a pilot trainee
Assistant insructor
You must be some kind of a hot stick
Should  call you "sir"
Only when  give you an order
Prepare for departure
Carmen and Zander go to work
It's amazing, us running into each other like this
Maybe it's fate
Maybe not
heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural
When it turned out it was you,  made sure we'd run into each other
Alright, take her out, Ibanez
Yes, ma'am
All eyes are on carmen as she grabs the stick
The ship shudders under her hand
She winks at Zander
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up
This isn't simulation anymore
Take'er out easy, cadet
Oh, yes, sir
Vector
Twenty-five by five, roll seven
And don't exceed port speed
Carmen rocks the stick, and the view from the bridge spins smoothly away from the dense orbiting yards os Luna toward the outer system
Or
They revoke our flight status
Oh,  see
teamwork
Carmen jogs past lumbering freighters
Zander's impressed
Steady as she goes, number one
Prepare for warp
Number two, design for Jupiter orbit
Yes, ma'am
Star drive in three
two
one
Space appears to bend
Zander and Carmen share a smile
They blur together, becoming one, then:
66		 - disappears in a flash of blinding light
67		   -  - have been divided into two teams
includes Ace, Katrina, Breckinridge, and Djana'd
Johnny, Shujumi, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy are part of
The object of this exercise is to capture your enemy's flag before your enemy captures yours
Bronski passes out Morita SmartRifles
These weapons have been modified for this exercise
If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail
You will be unable to move
You will be as good as dead
68		   -  - ' bumps the magnification of her heads up display to survey Blue Team's flag guarded by two recruits
She jumps down to joining other Red Team members on the move
' It's right over the next ridge
Only two guards
Johnny, Kitten Smith, and Dizzy open fire from athicket as they pass
Djana'd and the others collapse as their suits fail, Djana'd laughing because playing at war seems funny
You are now prisoners of the Blue Team
Tell us your plans or die
' Oh no
Name, rank, and mind your own business is all you get from me
69		   -  - opens fire as the Blue Team appears
Shujumi and other Blue Team members go down in an ambush led by Breckinridge
Johnny dives for cover, and finds himself sharing it with Dizzy
'm going in
Let's go
Kitten Smith makes arun for the flag with a rifle team
Ace and Katrina open fire from two new hidden Red Team positions, taking Kitten and his team down with a cross fire
Man, they're defended
no way in
Flip six, three hole
What
High school
remember
Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score
Johnny looks at the course in a new way, nods
Cover me
You got it
Johnny tumbles open ground, vaults into the air
Dizzy takes out Breckinridge as he rises to fire
Johnny lands, knocks out Katrina, then Ace
He picks up Ace's fallen Morita
Thanks, pal
70		  -  - watch Johnny firing both Moritas simultanously and taking out the remaining Red Team defenders
He grabs the Red Team flag and hurls it into the air like spear
Kid's got some moves
71		  -  - line up in the door of a , the military's standard utility aircraft, to practice drops from altitude
Smith,
McIntire,
Flores,
Rico, 'm making you sqaud leader
Sir, thank you, sir
Don't stand there dumb
Johnny jumps, plummeting toward the earth
-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa
Next in line, Ace scowls
72		 -  - have some free time
Johnny makes a big show of polishing the chevrons that designate him as Squad Leader
Look at him
Do you think anyone has ever been so pleased with himself
Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose,  guess
just want you guys to know that 'll never do anything that  haven't asked you to do first
Johnny approaches Dizzy
Couldn't've done it without you, Diz
Friends
Dizzy smiles, shakes
Yeah, sure
friends
Bronski walks through with the mail
Levy
Shujumi
Rico
Johnny grabs the -disk, pops it into his handcam
The Fleet Mail logo appears: Bet it's from my girl
Johnny's pals gather for a look
Carmen appears, dressed down to skivvies, in her quarters aboard starship Athena
Hi, Johnny,  would've written sooner, but they've really got us going every moment here
Yeow, Rico, you don't deserve that
Shhhh
'm glad you're doing so well
If they haven't made you squad leader by now, 'm sure you will
Johnny holds up his squad leader chevrons victoriously
All it takes is the love of a good woman
The image changes abrupltly
Now Carmen's wearing a trim blue flight suit
She stands the camera on Athena's gunnery deck
Outside , the rings of Saturn sparkle in bright solar light
Look at that
Isn't it beautiful
had to show you
It's great to be out here on my own
'm just not some little girl from Buenos Aires anymore
'm gonna be a starship pilot, and 'm gonna see the universe
(she sighs) And that's also the problem because don't really want to get married, Johnny
don't want to have kids
want a command, a ship of my own, and you know,  don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you and me
Johnny is stunned
All the other recruits suddenly seem to have something else to do
know that's not what you wanted to hear
but  have to follow my heart
'm sorry
'm afraid you'll hate me, and  couldn't stand that
Write me, alright
Write me, so 'll know that we'll always be friends
The Fleet Mail logo appears again:
Johnny shuts the handcam off
Ace puts a hand on his shoulder
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out
It's what  deserve
Whad'ya talkin  about
joined up for her
wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her
'm a fool
You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around
Johnny smiles in spite of himself
Thanks, Ace
Johnny turns for the door, flipping the chevrons like a coin
Dizzy watches him leave
She'd so like to comfort him
73		    -  - arm their Marauder power suits
Zim and Bronski wear Command model suits with rank designations
Johnny checks weapons, scans the electronics on each squad member's power suit
With the Marauder's visual capabilities, all you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise on my firing line
Do you get me
Sir, yes, sir
The live firing combat range is the closest simulation of actual combat we can provide
If you do not hit your target, it will shoot you
Fifty blackened    fitted with pulse guns are presently visible along a gauntlet of low walls, gullies, and three-story building facades
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly
Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check
Sir, yes, sir
On a signal from Zim, the Live Fire Combat Range comes to life as the target drones take cover and disappear from view
Perfect score for this exercise is 300
company came through last week with 285
expect you to do better
74		    -  - take out the target drones as they appear
Halfway through the course, a recruit takes a hit and goes down, immobilized
Djana'd has a clear shot, but Breckinridge gets in her way
' You're in my line of fire, Breckinridge Before the others can react, a second drone appears
Everyone kisses dirt
Pulses from the two drones fly thick overhead
Shujumi rises to fire, a round slams him back to the ground
Johnny and Djana'd knock out the two drones
Alright, no more screw ups
Ace takes point
Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks
Djana'd, you're rear guard
Move out
The squad resumes ist advance
Breckinridge bangs on his helmet
There is something wrong with his "head up" display
What's the problem
Dunno
Display's fritzed
' Lose another rifle, we're gonna mess up our score
Let me see
Breckinridge takes off helmet, hands it to Johnny
Djana'd turns on Breckinridge
Her "head up" zeroes him
' How come when something goes wrong, it's always you, Breckinridge
That's when Djana'd trips on a loose stone
She fumbles her rifle and it discharges
The round tears the top of Breckinridge's head off
The recruits stare in horror
Oh, God
uh
Zim arrives with Bronski on the bounce
Rico, you are relieved of squad command
Levy, McIntire you will escort private Rico to the
's Office
The recruits watch Johnny leave, stare aghast at their dead comrade
No one looks at Djana'd, who stands alone sobbing
75
'  -  - stands before the
braced by Katrina and Ace
Zim and the
are both saddened by the proceedings
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet
Sir, yes, sir
Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and  asked him to show it to me, sir
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico
Sir, no, sir
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise
Sir,  needed everyone in my squad operational, sir
wanted to win, sir
: (sigh) You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404
You may, of course, demand trial by court martial
Sir, no, sir
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you
Sir
guess  do, sir
Zim looks out the window
Djana'd, dressed for travel, in civilian clothes, crying as she heads off down Washout Lane
Sergeant, we've lost two recruits over this incident already
is there any possibility of salvaging this man
Zim believe so, sir
Alright
We'll try administrative punishment
Until then you are confined to your quarters, Rico
76		 -  - looks out the window to the parade ground where a  has been erected
The recruits look up as Zim enters
Alright, let's go, Rico
Johnny takes off his shirt
Ace who now holds the chevrons of squad leader, watches, feels bad for his pal
77		  -  - stand with recruits from other platoons
Johnny is led to the post and strung up as the
reads the charge
For incompetence of command, for failure to abide by safety regulations in a live fire exercise, for negligence which contributed to the death of a teammate
Zim steps up to Johnny, offers him a red rubber mouthpiece
Bite on this
It helps
know
recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced to administrative punishment
Ten lashes
Johnny takes it in his mouth
His tear away shirt is torn away
Johnny stands at the post alone
Corporal Bronski, a big man with an unhappy task, unrolls his whip
You may carry out the sentence
One
Johnny's face wrenched by pain, spontanous tears, a terrible sound stifled by the bright red mouthpiece
Two
Again
Dizzy flinches for Johnny
Three
Ace looks away
Four
Zim watches without any apparent emotion
Five
Johnny faints, sagging against his tether
78		  - cruises past, 600,000 metric tons of star class destroyer, and   lining her open hangar deck
79		 -    -   - works alone on the empty bridge
She yawns
Zander brings coffee for himself and Carmen
Thanks
You read my mind
Third watch always seems to last forever
Oh,  don't know
Depends on who you are spending it with
He caresses her hair
She kisses his hand
Zander notices the plot map
Profile's wrong
there
No,  replotted the course
It's more efficient this way
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh
Hey, check it
Zander slides into his chair, runs a check
You know  was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said
Don't change the subject
Am  right
Well, whad'ya know
Don't mess with the boss
So what'd the captain say
She got a command
and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her
She thinks we're good together
You and me, huh
Zander turns his chair so they are very close, moves a finger along her hand, up her arm and playfully around her breasts
have a feeling about us
We're good together, way ahead of the curve in every department
seem to be able to anticipate your needs
You know what  want
Carmen grabs him between his legs
No, what do you want
Zander pulls her to him and they kiss passionately
She brteaks it off, gets serious for amoment
want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet
Me, too
Day and Night-Cycle
They start to caress again when suddenly  sound
Captain Deladier appears on the hot screen, still waking up
Report
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed
Carmen and Zander frantically check their displays
'
It looks like an
asteroid
In this part of the system
Carmen and Zander see it through the front screens:		 huge tumbles directly towards them at terrific speed
Sweet Jesus
Carmen breaks glass that reads  , arms the switch within and fires the rockets
80		  - torques to one side
The asteroid grazes the ship, cutting ahuge gash in Athena's hull
Ice and rock travelling in ist wake shreds 81		   -   - Zander brace themseves as diamond hard particles pound the front screens
The ship continues to tumble
82		 -   - loses it's mooring, tumbling into other craft, explosions ripping the deck
83		 - -   - are sucked into space
Others hang on frantically as automatic doors seal Athena's wound and their fates
84		   -   - Deladier arrives on the bridge, now crowded as other rush to their stations
Zander's going through star charts
Where'd it come from
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone
Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way
Communications are down, ma'am
Engineering
Damage assessment
Hull's compromised
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am
Deladier notices Carmen staring at a monitor, stunned trails in the wreckage of the flight deck
Good work, Number 1
You'll do
Thank you, ma'am
85		' -  - wears his civilian clothes, pcks as the other recruits get ready for the day's training
No one says anything
He moves stiffly, careful of his back
It stinks, you goin
don't stay where 'm not wanted
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone
'm just supposed to take it, huh
Well, 'm not gonna, and guess that proves  just can't cut it
Corporal Bronski leans in, impassive
Your call's going through, Rico
Take it there
nearby - lights up
The screen flashes: His mother appears when she picks up the other end
Hello
Oh, Johnny
Hi, mom
Bill
pick up
it's Johnny
You little rat
You haven't called, you haven't written
It's been so lonely here without you
The screen splits as Johnny's father activates an extension
Johnny
Where's your uniform
Johnny's mother makes a face to shut him up
Well, it's just good to hear from you
What's up, son
It's not really working out for me here, dad
was thinking
was hoping it would be alright if  came home
Well, of course you should come home immedietly
've made a mess of things
've been so stupid
Don't talk like that
Get yourself home as fast as you can
We'll all have dinner
'll fix your favorite
Yeah
We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine
and
well, we love you, son
The sky in Buenos Aires seems to darken perceptively
Johnny's mother looks out the window
Oh, my, what's that
Looks like rain
This time of the year
The transmission ends abruptly
phone company logo appears: - Your transmission has been terminated due to atmospheric interference
Please try your call again later
Johnny zips his duffel, hefts it gingerly over his shoulder
Well, see ya
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny
What's that, Diz
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen
Dizzy turns on her heel and marches away
86
'  -  - signs form 1240/
Zim stands as witness
Now you, Sergeant
Zim signs bitterly
The
sighs
That's it, son
You can go
The
and Zim turn to other things
Johnny picks up his duffel and heads out the door
87		  -  - walks alone, sad
skimmer hums by overhead and he looks after it

Johnny looks up and sees Carmen
She lloks graet in uniform with the hat and the lieutenant's bars on her shoulders

Johnny remembers himself, snaps to attention, salutes
Dizzy and the others follow suit
Carmen salutes back, sheepish
Oh
at ease
Guess  oughta lose the hat when 'm off duty, eh
Dizzy, disgusted, turns back to Ace and Kitten Smith
Carmen tucks her hat under her arm
Her hair is very short
What happened to your hair
What do you think
Everyone did it when we got our wings
You don't like it, do you
It's alright,  guess
You hear from anyone made it out of
alive
Carmen shakes her head, sadly
It's funny
Sometimes  forget
Then it hits me, and  can't stop crying
try just to be happy 'm still alive
You don't look very happy to see me
Should  be
Johnny
Life is so different from the way it was

This is the part that's best for both of us
Don't do me anymore favors, eh
Johnny turns to leave
Johnny, wait
Forget it, Carmen
The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude
Johnny turns back to face Zander
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery
You heard me
Wanna make something out of it, private
Not with an officer, no, sir
The

Zander goes down, bleeding
Ace and Kitten Smith grab Johnny
Whoa, easy there, buddy
Nice punch
Zander staggers to his feet, ready to fight, but Fleet Officers pull him back
Carmen looks at Johnny, the hate in his eye, the blood on his fist
What's wrong with you
Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation

Alright
we got hot poop straight from the top: Willy's Wildcats is in with the first wave
Means more bugs for us to kill
This does nothing to break the tension
Lt
Willy reassures
Now if you follow orders and remember your training,  guarantee you'll make it back alive
Any questions
There are none
Alright
next we got a little last minute briefing from Military Intelli-gence think you're gonna like
The briefingplays on "head up" displays and the ready room screens captive   clicks and shrieks as torture it
The troopers cheer
Everyday Federal scientists are looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help
The head scientists turns and speaks to camera
It's Carl
Johnny and Dizzy share an amazed grin, noticing a difference in their old friend, something that speaks of
authority
To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy
Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior
Minimal , armored, completely lethal
You can blow a limb off
Carl picks up apulse gun and blows one of the bugs legs off
The insect screams
and it's still 86% combat effec-tive
But here's a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good
Carl fires again
The bug kicks and squeals as it dies
Carl tosses the pulse gun aside
Now while you are out killing bugs, we want you to be our eyes and ears
The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to divert meteors and aim them toward Earth
We need to know how they do this
If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your superior
Good luck and good hunting
The briefing ends as klaxons sound

Johnny brings the muzzle of the pulse gun under the hopper's nerve stem and

Johnny looks down at the terrible hole in his leg where bright arterial blood gushes

Oh, God
Oh, God, help me

Looks like you've got a little bug problem, ma'am
Stow it, trooper
Give it verything you've got
The cao troopers let the bugs have it, but the insects keep coming, the living crawling over the dead, and now, trudging up out of the ground, comes a The tanker bug starts to spray, creating a toxic perimeter around the hole
Rasczak arrives just as Birdie takes a chemical hit, falling to ground minus an arm, screaming
Johnny jumps, landing behind the tanker bug in the mouth of the hole
It turns with surprising speed
Johnny flips up onto its back, cracks its armor with his pulse cannon
Sugar, in for pick up
Rasczak and Sugar Watkins pull Birdie to safety
Johnny fires a rocket into the hole he's made in the tanker bug's back, and jumps clear
-
The big bug explodes
Gas that hole and close it
The Roughnecks fire gas rockets into the bug hole
Johnny touches down beside Rasczak
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier
Uni High Tigers, sir
Don't you remember

You're it until you're dead or  find someone better
Rasczak turns away, gives Birdie prosthetic thumps up as she is carried past to meet an arriving skimmer
Don't worry, Birdie, your next arm comes with a factory guarantee
Dizzy and Ace gather around Johnny, clap him on the back

Flaming debris rains down
Saddle up, Roughnecks

Roughnecks head out on the bounce
126		  -  -  - and the others look down a sheer cliff on the bug battery, a charred circular pit some ten meters across
Inside, something is moving
What kind of stinkin' bug is that
Johnny jumps the magnification on his "head up"
Down in the pit, a giant translucent   rears out of one of the subterranean tunnels that ring the battery
You never seen how they do it before
Johnny shakes his head
Swollen   gather around the plasma bug to inject it with their catalytic jelly
Agghh
It's making me sick
The plasma bug writhes in pain and begins to swell, color changing from yellow to blue in accordance with some violent internal chemical reaction
It's gonna pop
The plasma bug explodes in its cauldron
blast of bug plasma streaks past them towards the heavens
Now a new plasma bug crawls into the pit to begin the cycle anew
Sir, look
Sergeant Gillespie points
hole opens near the battery and dozens of warriors rampage out of the ground and up the cliff face toward the Roughneck position
We must be right over the colony
Let's get some air support, eh
Yes, sir
Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over
Rasczak moves off down the line giving orders
Corporal,  want pulse cannons there and there
Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge
Sugar, bring up that flame thrower
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance
They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships
Who's got the nuke
That'd be me, sir
Heat it up
Dizzy activates a tactical nuke
It makes a distinctive
Roughnecks, you may fire at will
The Roughnecks open fire
Bugs are blown to pieces but they keep climbing warrior breeches their line
Sugar Watkins torches it
The nuke's ready light flashes
'm hot, sir
Johnny blows a warrior away from the edge
Dizzy leans over and fires
The rocket streaks down toward the battery
An explosion in the two kiloton range turns the world black and white
When color returns Johnny and the others look down on the smoldering crater which was once the bug battery
Now comes the part  hate the most
What's that
We go down into the colony and make sure all the queens are dead
127		 -  - fight their way down gassed-out tunnels into bug city
They meet warrors at every turn and kill them
Helmet lamps make weird shadows of dead bugs piled everywhere along the way
You knew the Lieutenant before the war
What was he like
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all
Always had this little smile
Geez,  don't think 've ever seen him smile
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared
Johnny joins Rasczak, Ace and Dizzy and they blow away several warriors guarding the entrance of a large chamber
128		  -  - are eight meters long with corpulent bodies and tiny heads
Only one survives, and though she is herself dying, her abdomen, rippled by life within, continues to undulate
All dead except one, sir
Kill the bitch
Yes, sir

Dizzy's pulse cannon rips open the dying queen
Thousands of wriggling premature bugs come spilling out
Horrified, knee-deep Roughnecks set them afire

Rasczak stands, banging a spoon on his mess kit
Tango Urilla is now bug free

Roughnecks laugh and dance
Dizzy tries to pull Johnny into the fun
'mon
Nah,  don't do that anymore
You used to dance
said no
Want me to pull rank
Well, excuse me, sir
Dizzy heads back to the others
Johnny turns and finds Rasczak regarding him with an odd, sad smile
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico
Want some now
Yes, sir
Never pass up a good thing, eh
Gillespie appears
Lieutenant, Brigade's on the com
Rasczak heads away
Johnny joins Dizzy
Hey, Diz

Johnny takes her hand, bows implishly
May  have the honor
He pulls her out among the others and they begin to dance
Ace watches with a grin, puts some spirit in his fiddle

) That'll be all, Major
Dismissed
The Intelligence Officer disappears abruptly
new hologram appears
Rasczak's jaw drops
It's his former student Carl Jenkins, now a Colonel, weary and pissed off
This conference is over
Do your duty, Lieutenant
That's an order
Rasczak recovers, salutes stiffly
Yes, sir
132		-   -  - are making love
The door pops open
Rasczak stands there
Dizzy ducks under the covers
Johnny manages a salute
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet  immediately
Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics
Yes, sir
Who's that with you
Dizzy shows herself, grinning
Report in ten minutes
Rasczak slams the door shut on them
They fall back into one anothers arms, laughing as they resume lovemaking
Planet
What kind of name is that
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy
133		  -   -  - move through canyons of towering wind-carved rock formations
Gillespie carries the communications package
don't understand it, Lieutenant
It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade
not even their transponder
Keep trying, Sergeant
134		  -  -  - walk in a column far below
Something is watching from the above
, lots of them, moving from rock to rock for better position
135		  -  -  - sees something out of the corner of his eye
The hoppers hit
Several Roughnecks go down
Everyone opens up
Dive-bombing bugs are blown to bits
Roughnecks set them on fire when they hit the ground
Johnny, watch out
burning bug hurls itself at Johnny
Johnny jumps out of the way as Dizzy fires, blowing it apart
The deadly hoppers seem to be everywhere above them in the rocks
'
136		  -  - move out into the open
In the distance they see 4th Brigade , a walled compound and partially constructed landing pad
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval
We're off this rock
Gillespie, do you read me
Two hoppers are pulling Gillespie up into the rocks where other bugs join to feast
Throw a rifle
Dizzy tosses her Morita to Rasczak
Gillespie writhes in the hopper's claws
Rasczak fires, killing Gillespie
expext any one here to do the same for me
Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action
The rest of you make for 4th Brigade
Johnny and the others cover the Roughneck retreat as hoppers soar down on the flat lands from the canyon walls
Johnny and the others blast bugs out of the air
100
second wave of hoppers come in
For now, the sky is clear
4TH
137		4TH   -  - is 50 meters by 100, standard issue pre-fab
The Roughnecks land on the compound wall
Inside,   graze on the remains of 200 dead cap troopers strewn over the complex
Jeez, Command really humped the bunk on this one
Rasczak turns away
Roughnecks engage in the sport of methodically killing the workers
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now
My last Sergeant lost the com pack
Put together a search team and find the radio shack
We need retrieval
Yes, sir
138		4TH   -   -  - surveys the aftermath of the last stand with Rasczak, insect and human dead everywhere
(
) It's here, sir
139		 -  - enter the radio room
is slumped over the console with hole in the back of his head
Johnny checks the equipment
It' dead, too
Diz, see what you can do
'm on it
Dizzy goes to work
Rasczak checks the wound in the back of the dead major's head
What's that look like to you, Rico
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir
(
) Lieutenant,  think you're gonna wanna see this, sir
140		  -  - in the middle of the floor is surrounded by carnage
Dirty bugs came in right when they were having chow
Gas that hole and seal it
Then they hear a sound
Tap tap tap
Rasczak signals for quiet
Tap tap tap tap
It's coming from the kitchen
141		 -  - enter cautiously
The noise is coming from a freezer
Ace stands ready to fire
Johnny levers open the door, jumps back as  , 60, tumbles out face first
Officer on the deck, sir
Pick up the general
Roughnecks prop him up
General Owen tries to talk, but no words come out
Rasczak bends down to listen
Get out
you gotta get me out
General Owen, sir
The old man grins, hugely relieved
At ease, Lieutenant
Thank God for you, for all of you
this is grand
so where's the boat
142		 -  -  - help the old General, now wrapped in a blanket, rambling
was forced to hide, of course
The security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake
Diz, what's with the uplink
Dizzy lokks up from where she is working on the radio controls
Workin on it
They get in your mind
they make you do things
Look here
They did it to Farley
He points at the hole of the dead major's head
The distress call
The bugs wanted us to rescue you
Oh, you can be sure of it
They were biding their time
waiting for the most opportune moment
Rasczak's lost interest in the general
He's on the com
To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak
Prepare for attack
Repeat
We are going to be attacked
They weren't gonna do it to me
Oh no
know too many secrets
Rasczak looks at General Owen with contempt
(
) Fire in the hole
An explosion in the mess hall closes the bug hole
143		  -  - blinks as he steps out into the light
Roughnecks snap to attention
General Owen looks at the carnage that was once his command and begins to keen, collapsing to his knees
Oh God
My soldiers
All of my boys and girls
The Roughnecks are shocked
They've never seen a general break down before
Lieutenant Rasczak slaps Owen hard
Shut up
Your soldier's dead and you're not
know
wish you'd shoot me
oughta
And it looks like Rasczak just might, but just then Ace touches down next to Johnny and Rasczak
Lieutenant, we got trouble
144		 -  - and Johnny join other stunned Roughnecks to see    on the march from every direction
Bug batteries open up in the distance
Warm it all up
Everything you got
Levy, collect the big guns from the towers
Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded
Rico, where's my communications
What's going on, Diz
(
) got power
Gimme a minute
Johnny runs for the communications room
We don't have a minute
145		 -  - has the board up
Outside the battle has begun
Nukes go
and pulse guns chatter
What frequency
All bands
Roughneck patrol to battle group
Roughneck patrol to battle group
(
) This is Rodger Young
What's going on down there
We're taking plasma
We have Orion -11 as clear
,
We need pick up now
(
) What is your position
Landing zone is extremely hostile
Come down on this transmission
(
) Inside 4th brigade compound
That's crazy
Then  hope you have a crazy pilot
Keep the line open, Dizzy
Johnny races out the door
146		4TH   -  - is white hot as Roughnecks on the walls unload nukes
Johnny crosses the compound, lands next to Rasczak on the wall
Boat coming down, sir
The Roughnecks stop firing as they run out of nukes
'm empty
all nuked out
Me, too
Johnny scans the battlefield
Nukes have turned the surface into dark glass
Now, out of the smoke, come the bugs, steaming glass cracking beneath millions of marching feet
Jeez, we musta killed a million already
Not enough,  guess
Sugar Watkins sees Genera Owen in the compound below, stumbling aimlessly among his dead soldiers
General
, stay with the wounded
Sir, the general
Ah, the hell with him
Hoppers sweep into the compound
The Roughnecks open fire
General Owen make easy pickings for ones that get through
Fall back
form a circle
If no living bug comes over that wall, we cannot be harmed
Dizzy arrives on thr bounce as the Roughnecks fall back into the compound
Bugs pile in over the walls
The circle affords them 360 degrees of kill zone
Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy
We control the sky until retrieval
Yes, sir
Rasczak, Sugar Watkins, Johnny and Dizzy stand back-to-back in the center of the circle, sweeping the skies with the heavy guns from the towers
Hoppers are blown to pieces
Getting low here, sir
300 rounds and counting, sir
Make every shot count
Johnny looks up
hurtles down through bursts of bug plasma, takes a grazing hit, rights itself with retros and lands within the circle
Roughnecks cheer, saved
Sergeant, secure the boat
Yes, sir
Roughnecks move to protect the boat
The hatch blows open
Board the wounded
Dead bugs ring the compound walls, forming ramps for living insect soldiers to enter the compound in greater numbers
Move to retrieval on my command
First group, now
The circle shrinks as Roughnecks fall back and board the boat
More and more bugs pile in over the compound walls
Alright, Flores
Levy
Rico
Suddenly, the ground collapses under Rasczak
He falls in to his waist, vomits blood as something chews on him from below
Cover us, Ace
Ace and the others fire from the boat
Johnny and Dizzy fire at the ground around Rasczak
Rasczak stops screaming
They try to pull him free
Hit your jets, sir
can't My legs are gone
Get on the boat
The compund wall collapses
wave of bugs charges in
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet
've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time
We're not leaving you here, sir
Weakly, Rasczak picks up his pulse gun, checks the power
This is my farm
Get on the boat, That's an order, Sergeant
Give'em hell, sir
Johnny and Dizzy run for the boat
Rasczak opens fire, picking his shots, but soon the bugs are all over him
'mon you sons of bitches
There's no bug alive can kill a real mAAAAAAA
At the boat, Dizzy turns to look back at Rasczak
hopper swoops down on Dizzy, it's claws ripping into her abdomen
Johnny blows the bug off her back
Blood sprays from a deep gash in her neck
Johnny picks her up, tries to stop the blood with his hand
The life is leaving her eyes
Hang on, Diz
don't die on me
breaches the broken wall
Ace jumps out to help his friends
The hatch closes just as the tanker bug sprays
The boat blasts off, dripping metal
147		  -  - holds Dizzy in his arms, drenched in her blood, fighting -forces as the boats heads for orbit
bought the farm, didn't , Johnny
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz
It's alright 'cause  got to have you, Johnny
push Johnny aside, go to work on Dizzy
148		 -  -  - slams into the cockpit
Out the front screen, violent bursts of fill the sky as they break atmosphere
Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that rock
The co-pilot turns around
It's Zander
His eyes narrow
On whose authority, Corporal
This would be mine, sir
Acting Sergeant John Rico
've assumed command on this mission
The pilot turns around
It's Carmen
Johnny
thought you were dead
'm not, but alot of my soldiers are
Glass the planet
Johnny leaves
Carmen punches up Fleet Command
Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard Planet -11
149		 -   -  - returns to Dizzy's side as the medics struggle to save her
Blood pours out of her mouth
Her body thrashes
' ' Dizzy dies
Medic slaps her
Her head lolls, mouth open, eyes blank
They drop her and move on to the next casualty
Johnny sits there, stunned
Carmen enters from the cockpit
Negative on your request
Fleet Command has the battle group on standby
Carmen sees Dizzy lying dead on the deck
'm sorry
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit
No,  think something's up
The Sky Marshall's here
She points out for a viewing port
Johnny looks
Fifteen battle groups, 100 ships strong, lay off Planet , all of them dwarfed by the Sky Marshall's flagship, Buenos Aires
thought you were , Johnny
That was just a mix up
You look so
don't know, you look like you've really been in it
What happened to your eye
Carmen touches the scar over her eye
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big
like it
It's kinda
you
150		  -   - lands on the flight deck of the Rodger Young in the midst of the flotilla
151		  -   - enters, watches Carmen dress
She hums as she checks herself in the mirror, touches thr scar over her eye, smiles
Where are you going
funeral
That girl who died on the way up his girl
Yeah
How do you feel about him now
don't know, Zander
do
152		  -   - enters as Johnny speaks
Dizzy is laid out in dress gray
The surviving Roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects
Dizzy bought the farm
She was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets
But in war, we must go on without our friends
We take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death
Let me tell you what it is: Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting
Several   march into the bay
Officer on deck
Everyone snaps to attention
Colonel Carl Jenkins strides into the room
His eyes are hollow, and he looks grim
He returns Johnny's salute, nods to Carmen
Please continue, Sergeant
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears
She'd want us to remember her
with a vengeance
So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy
Kill as many as you can
You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death
Johnny nods to the
They load Dizzy's body into a tube
Johnny steps back, salutes Dizzy
Everyone salutes
Womb to tomb, cap trooper
Womb to tomb
The   fires the tube
Out the viewports, disperses into space
The Roughnecks file out
Carl approaches
Carmen takes Johnny and Carl by the hand
Well, look at this
The three of us back together again
How are you, Carl
Johnny, 'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet
That mission had a very low survival probability
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it
We thought there might be a brain on
You knew and you sent them anyway
colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a Brain
we think 300 generations
Woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a Brain
Carl sees the way Carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug
You don't approve
Well, too bad
We're in this for the species, boys and girls
It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday  have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths
Didn't they tell you, Colonel
That's what cap troopres are good for
Carl allows himself a tiny smile
Hope you're ready for more
We're going back to  to capture that Brain
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir
hear they need a new Lieutenant
Want the job
'll take it
until  get killed or you find someone better
sound
Suddenly, everyone has someplace to go
Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl
It's good to see you two
It reminds me of the way things were before
Carl turns abruptly and heads away
His entourage follows
Take care, wilya Johnny
See you on the bounce
153		  -  &  - steps onto the bridge
There's a new  2 sitting in Zander's chair
She's right out of Tereshkova, and she looks scared
Carmen turns to Captain Deladier
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow
He requested a combat assignment
There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground
had no choice but to let him go
He said you'd understand
Carmen bites her lip, takes first chair
Deladier feels bad for her, knows she's made a painful decision
154		  -   - are suiting up
Ace enters
Officer on the deck
Roughnecks fall in
Johnny steps into the room
There are many new and much younger faces
only have two rules
Rule one, everyone fights
Rule two, no one quits
If you don't do your job, 'll kill you myself
Do you get me
We get you, sir
(to Ace, sotto voce) Who're all these kids
We got reinforced
Most of'em just got outa boot
We're the old men, Ace
155		  - 4TH   -  - have landed
Cap troopers set fire to huge piles of dead bugs push bodies into a mass grave, among them Rasczak
Johnny walks past with his team
We'll take this high ground
Lookouts there and therte and up there
If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know
Got it
Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers
Down there on the flats, eh
Listen up, Roughnecks
Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet
Roughnecks boo
Alright, cut it out
We will deploy from skimmers in teams of six
If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out of business
Any questions
hurtles out of the sky and lands on the high ground Johnny has intended forb his
Johnny scowls, marches over to the boat and confronts a
Would'ya mind moving your boat
Better talk to the boss
The cargo bays open to deploy
Zander jumps down to oversee the operation
You're standing on my
, Lieutenant
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground
You can have everything else, eh
You heard the Sky Marshall
Move it all down - Suddenly, in the distance, bug batteries open fire, not one but twenty
Zander and Johnny share a look of concern
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire
(to his crew chief) 'll take the first group
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash
156		 -    - begins to take a toll on the battle group as the orbiting ships lay their eggs
Cap Troopers are scliced as they drop
157		  -  - turns to Carmen
Evasive action
Carmen dodges other starships, turns to her new number 2
Prepare for warp
2 Yes, ma'am
Warp in 5
4
3
-
The Rodger Young takes a direct hit
158		  -    - is cut in two
The rear section explodes, the forward section begins to burn towards the bridge
159		  -  - calmy evacuates the bridge
Power fails and so does the gravity
This is Rodger Young, we're going down
Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down
Ibanez
'
160		  -   - and Captain Deladier run for the lifepods
An explosion flips the corridor
Captain Deladier's leg is crushed when an airlock closes on her
Carmen hits the release, pulls her free
Deladier pushes Carmen away
Leave me, Lieutenant
That's an order
No way, ma'am
161		  -    - pushes into the chaotic life pod bay
shoving, screaming, fighting
The ship pitches
They tumble, landing near a pod
Carmen jumps for it, pulls Deladier in after
162		  -    - disintegrates as lifepods shoot away toward the planet
163		 -    - navigates through a graveyard of floating wreckage, dead cap troopers, someone's trombone
She sets her beacon and the pod plummets downward
Mayday, mayday
This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez in lifepod RY63
'm going in
164		  -   -  - board the Skimmers
Zander approaches Johnny, upset
What's your problem now, Lieutenant
The Rodger Young just burned up
Johnny's face falls
Any survivors
Zander points
Far in the distance, a glowing pod plummets toward the planet
Johnny tracks it on his "head up"
165		 -  -  - is shaken violently as the pod hits atmosphere
166		  -  - ' hits and goes straight through the crust of Planet
167		   -  - comes to rest
Carmen blows the hatch, pulls Deladier out, grabs a Morita pulse rifle
Tunnels lead in every direction
This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez
Is anyone receiving
168		  -  - grabs the handset from Ace
(
) Affirmative
Carmen, this is Roughneck base camp
What is your present location
169		   -  - sees a warrior coming at her from out of the shadows
Carmen fires a burst and kills it
Now there are two
Carmen backs up firing, but there are too many
My present location is 42 degrees South by 176 degrees East
situation is extremely hostile
They have her
She puts the barrel of the Morita in her mouth, but a claw cut her trigger finger off at the knuckle
170		  -    -  - and Zander are horrified by what they hear
(
) We've gotta go get her
You know as well as  do she's probably already dead
Johnny knows it's true, swallows bitterly, turns away
That's when he sees it
Nearby, the ground shifts, a claw breaks through, a hole opens up and bugs boil up out of the ground
Here they come
They turn and see a second bug hole open up
We're outa here
Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers
This real estate's about to go buggy
Hey, just calm down, 'm giving the orders here- The entire area underneath the base camp collapses to form a huge new canyon
The Hercules boat topples, crushing Skimmers and unfortunate Fleet personnnel
171		  -  - and the surviving Roughnecks pick themselves up
The are now 30 meters below the planet's surface
Above them, bugs line the wide rim of the newly formed canyon
Form a perimeter
Through the dust, exposed bug tunnels can be seen in the canyon walls and piling out of them by the score, deadly Arachnid warriors
Johnny throws Zander a pulse cannon
Make yourself useful, fly boy
The Roughnecks open fire at the charging bug horde
Warriors are blown to pieces
Gas grenades fly and
rounds close tunnels
maimed warrior gets through and heads for Zander
Johnny and Ace team up to blow it away
Zander takes a deep breath, loos around, impressed
The Roughnecks have killed a great many bugs
Ace, get on the com
Tell Fleet we need retrieval
Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant Barcalow
Sugar Watkins tosses a bloody jump boot his way
Thanks
Fleet Command says retrieval's no go
The battle group's at safe distance
and we got another problem
Ace points out a Tanker bug that's been brough up to the rim
Johnny sees another
Looks like they're gonna hose us down
Johnny chews on this
Alright
Listen up, Roughnecks
We're gonna head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young survivors we run across, and join Company
Get me
We get you, sir
Zander, awkward in a power suit, confronts Johnny
What do you think you're doing
'm gonna save Carmen
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective
They hang you for that, Rico
Yeah, that's right
Johnny and Zander stare each other down
Let's go
Move out
Johnny starts for the gaping mouth of an exposed bug tunnel and the others fall in behind him
Bug hunt
172		 -  - leads his deadly force through enemy territory
The Roughnecks kill everything that gets in their way
Zander lends his inexperienced hand
Mr
Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers
Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way
Yes, sir
Warriors appear in the tunnel behind them
Sugar, close the tunnel
Fire in the hole
Sugar Watkins fires an
round and seals the tunnel
173		  -   -  - opens her eyes
She can hear
She's in a pit filled with human dead
nearby carcass wears a uniform from 4th Brigade Off in the dark she hears
She crawls over rotting corpses toward the sound
The moaning turns to
It's coming from outside the pit
She pulls herself up to peer over the edge
174		  -    -  - sees hundred of bugs at work, ,  and dozens of small (2 meters)
Aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention
She sees the source of the screaming:	Captain Deladier is hold between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees, The   is huge (5 meters) and pulpy
has vestigial legs that cannot support ist weight, and so it must be moved by a shifting carpet of chariot bugs
thorn-like  unfolds out of the brain bug and strikes, driving deep into Deladier's head and sucks her brains out
Carmen watches horrified as Deladier dies
The suddenly a warrior grabs her from above and drags her out of the pit
She screams as its claws slice into her limbs
Now the brain bug comes for her
She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like spike coming toward her
Carmen is no longer looking for escape
All she wants to do is die
Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen
Carmen hears it
- , getting louder
Johnny enters the chamber alone
The warriors move toward him
He holds up a , source of the high-pitched tone
The ready light flashes
The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks
The warriors freeze
You know what this is
Johnny makes an explosive sound
The Brain Bug slowly withdraws its palp
Sure you do
You're a big fat smart bug, aren't you
Johnny moves toward Carmen
The Brain Bug's multiple eyes track him
The warriors holding Carmen threaten
Johnny turns on the brain bug, his finger on the nuke's trigger
'll take you with me
The Brain Bug clicks
The warriors back off
Carmen collapses
Johnny reaches for her
Take my hand
Chariot bugs move the Brain Bug down a hole
Workers seal the hole behind it with amazing speed
Johnny drags Carmen back toward the tunnel he entered from
The warriors charge
Roughnecks
Johnny throws himself on top of Carmen as the Roughnecks burst into the chamber, guns blazing
The fight is furious, point blank, deadly to bug and Roughneck alike
Sugar Watkins screams as a warrior rips his arm off
Zander takes a claw through the gut
He blows it away, sees his intestines hanging out of the wound, shoves them back inside and keeps on fighting
warrior rears up over Johnny and Carmen
Weapon
Ace throws him a Morita
Johnny catches it, pumps three rounds into the bug's nerve stem
He struggles out from under the dead warrior
Every bug in the chamber is dead
Are you hurt
Carmen throws her arms around Johnny
Johnny
Zander takes this in
Carmen sees him, then his wound
Zander
Oh, you're hurt
Ace takes a look at his wound, makes a face
Ah geez
Zander pushes him away, struggles to his feet
Can you walk
(clenched teeth) Not a problem
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole
Various components are gladly passed forward
Johnny and Ace help her putting it on
thought  was dead
Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh
It wasn't luck
Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you
Is it true
Yeah, if  live through this, they'll probably hang me
Now com'on, let's move out
175		   -  - double-time it, racing for the surface
They come to a fork
Which way
Up
We gotta be near  Company by now
The tunnel floor drops out
disappear into the hole
climb up into the tunnel
The Roughnecks bachk up fast, shooting
Zander staggers, collapses
Johnny drops to his side, rolls him over
How bad are you, pal
Been better, buddy
Johnny sees warriors coming up into the tunnel by the score
Alright, we're gonna carry you
Nah,  figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late
Gimmee the nuke
Zander checks his pulse cannon's available power
Don't be a hero
This is my farm
Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here
Johnny nods, hands him the nuke
Carmen sees what's happening
Zander, what are you doing
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby
Zander, no
He grabs her and kisses her
Johnny drags Carmen away
Zander opens fire as the first warriors reach his position
176		  -   -  - race desperately for the surface
They hear the chatter of Zander's pulse cannon and the screams of dying bugs
Tears stream down from Carmen's face
177		  -  - and the surviving Roughnecks make it to the surface
subterrenean nuclear explosion blows a column of earth and stone into the air
178		  -     - and the others enter  Company's perimeter
No one notices their arrival because everyone's gathered in a big circle watching the Brain Bug
Look
they got it
Several of its delicate legs were apparently broken during the capture
Carl approaches it without fear, puts his hand on the thing
What's it thinking, Colonel
Carl smiles in a cruel way
It's afraid
Johnny and Carmen approach the General
Sir, 'd like to turn myself in
Dereliction of duty by an officer during wartime
And you freely admit to it
Yes, sir
Is what this man says true, Lieutenant
