The Blood-Splattered Bride We hear labored breathing
: "Revenge is a dish best served cold" - Old Klingon Proverb - breathing continues
Then a '  talks over the breathing; '  (
) Do you find me sadistic
: of a lying on the floor, looking up
The woman on the floor has just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating
Her face is bloody, beaten up, and torn
The high contrast / turning the red blood into black blood
hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice holding a white handkerchief with the name "" sewn in the corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the young woman's face
Little by little as the Male Voice speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the audience
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the "" of the title
In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes were called    conquerors
In our age, the men who    shake the planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone
For while he corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure
'  (
) bet  could fry an egg on your head about now, if  wanted to
He continues wiping away the blood
'  (
) No kiddo, 'd like to believe, even now, you're aware enough to know there isn't a trace of sadism in my actions
Okay - Maybe towards these other jokers - bot not your
We see for a moment,    looking down at the woman on the floor
Bill (from behind) bent down over her
Four others in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is male)
And about four   lying in their own blood
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated by blood death and gunfire
And firstly or lastly, depending on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a white bridal gown
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she will only be referred to as The
Back to  of The
The  on the floor
Her pretty face is wiped clean
'  (
) No Kiddo at this moment, this is me at my most masochistic
While still in her  The Bride speaks for the first time in the picture
She looks up at the man standing over her and says; Bill, 'm pregnant
It's your baby
After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a  and The Bride receives a bullet in the side of her head
: : Presentation Credit "The 4th Film by " : /  of a Young  in a
Shot to death
The  speaks to us in a ; (
) That's Tim, Arthur's best friend
in a frilly pink dress with two bullet holes in her
(
) That's his girlfriend Janeen
, shot to death, wedding bouquet still clutched in her dead fist
(
) That's my best friend from work Erica
shot fulla holes
(
) That's the minister

by his side in an old-fashioned flower print dress
(
) That's his wife
slumped over an organ
(
) Organ player, don't know her name
(
) That's Arthur
Arthur Plympton
The name on his driver's license was Charles Arthur Plympton, but for some reason he preferred Arthur
Maybe if he went by Carles people would have called him Charlie
If that was his reason for going by Arthur  can understand it
Nothing wrong with the name Charlie, except he didn't look like a Charlie, he looked like an Arthur
Obviously you'll have to take my word on this
Speaking of names, was about two seconds away from becoming Mrs
Charles Arthur Plympton
And then finally, The Bride
(
) And that, that's me
'm the Bride
We do a  from the Bride looking dead in the bridal gown To The Bride, still in /, still in a bridal gown, but the asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the past, because she looks like a million dollars now
three million even
() - The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia convertible
Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind behind her
(
) Looked dead, didn't
Well wasn't, but it wasn' for lack fo trying,  can tell you that
Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma
coma  was to lie in for five years
When  woke up,
went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge roarded and  rampaged and  got bloody satisfaction
In all, 've killed 33 people to get to this piont right now
have only one more
The last one
The one ' driving to right now
The only one left
And when  arrive at my destination
'm gonna Kill Bill
As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax
The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home
: Chapter one "2" : The 's of The She's sitting in a parked pickup truck
Her eyes focused on something
The ' : very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of Pasadena, California
purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the driveway
tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle the grass on the front yard
mailbox with the name "The " on it sits out in front of the lawn
We hear but don't see ice cream truck bells
: "The city of , " We hear a Car Door Open and Close
The Bride Walks into the shot, heading for the front door
:  long, white female finger pushes a doorbell
- The front door opens and an attractive black  the same age as The Bride stands in the doorway
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the blonde on her doorstep
The on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her eyes
- (That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see it with an orange filter
) We're back inside the wedding chapel
The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four people in black suits
black woman   in the face
see it's the black housewife, five years earlier
The We Zoom quick out of her eyes to , a (Whenever we hear this theme throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens to be in front of her at that moment
) As the Vengeance Theme plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate
When the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride  The Housewife
'   - The white woman and the black woman  into the center of the living room,  onto her coffe table in front of the sofa
These two wildcats go at each other savagely, the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing together on the plush carpet
The The Bride, sending her  backwards into the small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and the mail is kept
The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a from behind by The Bride that sends them both into
An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the negro experience in the American military
Starting with a plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war, the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and finally Colin Powell
The Bride and The Housewife all this reducing everything to rubble
They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,
When The Housewife  The Bride in the nose
The hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and comes out with a
The rises from the floor, and   a  in a sheath hanging from her belt known as a
(  is a long, double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what Navy Seals use to kill humans with
) The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally demolished living room
The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep into the    other one
Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women locked in life and death combat
When The back kitchen door opens, and a -- , carrying a lunch box steps inside
-- Mommy, 'm home
The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year old's voice
The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to the eyes of The Bride
The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay
" The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks into the newly destroyed living room
The Housewife switches to her mommy voice
Hey baby, how was school
The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a bar room brawl
Mommy, what happened to you and the Room
Oh, that good for nothin dog of yours, got his little ass in the living room and acted a damn fool, that's what happened
Barney did this
She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries to enter the living room
Now baby, you    can't come in here, there's broken    glass all over the floor, and you    gonna cut yourself
The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like she's been fighting
The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl
This is a old friend of mommy's ain't seen in a long time
Hello sweety, 'm *()*, what's your name
* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real name, it will be     ,
that is, till  want you to know
* The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she just stares at the blond lady
Her name is Nikki
Nikki
What a pretty name for such a pretty little girl
How old are you Nikki
Nikki still says nothing, only stares
Nikki, *()* aked you a question
(to The Bride) 'm four
Four years    old, aye
You know once had a    little girl
She'd be five right    now
Maybe you two could of played    with each other
Now baby, me an *()* have some grown-up talk to talk about, so you go in your room now and leave us alone till  tell you to come out
The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself
(snapping her fingers) Nikkia - in your room - now
The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the door of her bedroom
The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat both finished
Want some coffee
Yeah, sure
The two women move into the kitchen
The Bride re-sheaths her , and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the drawer
The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife pours both of them coffee
Cream and sugar
Both, please
As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's : (
) This Pasadena homemaker's name is Jeanne Bell
Her husband is Dr
Lawrence Bell
But back when we were acquainted, five years ago, her name was
Her code name, was ""
Mine was
The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs
Were you expecting me
Yes and no
Bill got in touch with me right after you woke up, and then again a little later after your episode in Japan
(pause) So  suppose it's a little late for a apology, huh
You suppose correctly
Even if  was sincere
Oh
'm quite positive you're sorry, now
Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with low volume; Look bitch,  need to know if you're gonna start anymore shit around my baby girl
You can relax for now
'm not going to murder you in front of your daughter
That's being more rational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of
Well that's a demonstration of Bill's complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what 'm thinking, and what  might do
It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness  lack, not rationality
She pauses for effect -- the ham
'll wait for now, but  won't wait for long
'll allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again, preferably as far away from Nikki as possible
could have just  you, didn't,  demand respect for that
Since this is not a , consider it a
And as two former Deadly Vipers, we will observe Viper rules of honor
One on one - no help - no bushwhackin - no treacherous weapons - on weapon of choice - our skill and our bodies
Vernita says her name; *()* - 'm not through telling you
Failure to keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a building across the street from Nikki's elementary school
Now, feel free to respond
Look
know  fucked you over fucked you over bad
wish to God hadn't, but  did
The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face
If  could go back in a machine would, but  can't
All  can tell you is 'm a different person now
don't care
Be that as it may,  know  do not deserve mercy or forgiveness
However,  beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
-- Bitch, you can stop right there
The -word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as well)
(leans in close) Just because  have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy
You and  have unfinished business
And not    a goddamn fuckin thing you've    done in the subsequent five years -    including getting knocked up - is    going to change that
You have every right to wanna get even -- -- But that's where you're wrong, Vernita
don't want to get even
To get even, even Steven
would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr
Bell, to come home and kill him
That would make us even
No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands
Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill
When do we do this
It all depends
When do you want to die
Tomorrow
The day after tomorrow
That's about as long as 'll wait
How bout tonight, bitch
Spendid
Where
There's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here
We meet there around two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be bothered
have to fix Nikki's cereal
As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter
Bill said you were one of the best ladies he'd ever seen with an edged weapon
Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom
" Fuck you, bitch,  know he didn't qualify it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba
(snorts to herself) Black Mamba,  shoulda been motherfuckin Black Mamba
As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand inside the cereal box
Weapon of choice
And if you want to stick with your butcher knife, 'm cool with that
Very funny
Vernita    from inside the cereal box at The Bride
The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, The Bride
Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and again
The bullet    of the tiny kitchen
The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her back,      , Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and the kitchen counter
While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to the  on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and up to the handle, with    all the 's steel entering Vernita's abdomen
The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker pinned to it
The two former colleagues meet eyes
Sorry, bout the bushwhack
Please don't
Do to your daughter, what you did to mine
(she takes her hand) won't
Vernita dies
The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki standing in the doorway of her room
The little girl sees her mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood
And she sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife still in her hand
But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry
The little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her stare
As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "" sewn on    it
And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood off her    blade
It was not my intention to do this in front of you
For that 'm sorry
But you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming
When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, 'll be waiting
And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to her mourning
'  - The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her vehicle
She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she makes here getaway
She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words "Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a pimpy font
She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a page that's headline reads; On the pager are five names numbered going down the page written in red ink
The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink
The second name on the list is; The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through Vernita's name
Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of the residential district
: Chapter two The comatose Bride The comatose Bride lying in her hospital bed, wide open unblinking sightless eyes, that constantly stare yet see nothing
The Bride is at the beginning of her comatose journey
: under her face
"Five years and four months earlier in the city of El Paso, Texas" Although we're only in a tight , we can tell a few things: one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three, it's night; and four, one hellva  is pounding outside
- The rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital
The wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into  and stops
The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the wet night
red umbrella opens as rain falls down
the back of a head wearing a yellow rainslicker hood, framed by the red umbrella above it, which water cascades down and beats a rhythm against
The figure in the yellow rainslicker with the red umbrella (who we can guess is female) starts walking towards the hospital
Left Side                   Right Side The Bride's unblinking        The back of the yellow comatose sleep

her yellow galoshes slapping against the wet asphalt, and splashing through puddles
The Bride in her coma          the hospital's electrical doors - -
We follow behind the woman in the raincoat as she walks from outside into the hospital down the hall, and into the ladies room door
The in her coma                      ' stepping into a sheer, white stocking
:   , ' : :  , ' -                          : The liquid is drawn up into the syringe

- The door marked "ladies" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray with the "Goodbye forever"-filled syringe on it
She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's room
: " Member of The codename: " ' '   - The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her room
Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman
' looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and opposite number
The ' wide open - blank stare
Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her; might never of liked you
Point in fact  despise you
But that doesn't suggest  don't respect you
You were a master of a profession that's most difficult to master
Dying in our sleep is a luxury our kind is rarely afforded
My gift to you
As she lifts the syringe off the tray
Her cell phone
She curses to herself
there can be only one person on the other end
she answers it
Hello, Bill
(pause) Affirmative
(pause) Comatose
(pause) 'm standing over her right now
(pause) What
The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell phone
Don't fuckin ssshhh me
If you think  came all the way down to Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm no less - just to tuck sleeping beauty in bed - you got another fuckin thing comin - (pause, then real loud) You don't owe her Shit
(then again, but quieter) You don't owe her shit
(pause) Man, fuck that bitch
(pause) Oh you're not are you
Well Bill, you never leave a job half done
great teacher taught me that once, he looked a whole lot like you
Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say
We don't hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks
We can tell by her face, he's making some sense
After awhile she answers back; guess
(pause) No,  don't need to guess,  know
(pause) Affirmative
(pause) love you too, bye bye
The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The comatose Bride with the open eyes
Even though her face is expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling
Thought that was pretty funny didn't ya
Word of advice shithead, don't you ever wake up
Elle leans closer to the Bride's face
Ya know now  get a better look at you, you're not so damn pretty
Yeah, you go that Venus thing going for you but
ya know, now  get a closer look at you you're kinda weird looking
You got this big nose that doesn't fit with the rest of your face, your eyes are two different sizes
And look at your skin
My complexion is way better than yours -- The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions
She in Elle's face
Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down at The comatose Bride in her bed
Oh, no you didn't
She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown
Yanks Her up to a sitting position
And  her hard in the face three times
If you ever take your ass out of this Goddamn bed for as long as you fuckin live,  will beat you into the ground, bitch
- Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the hallway
She passes by a , on a gurney
(yelling) Nurse come here quick, we're losing this man
Elle doesn't even look back
Tough titty,  quit
She walks out of the

the sound of a  , doing loop de loops and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood
The  stops
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host
' drinking her blood
drinking blood
when The Bride's hand comes into  and the bug flat
Her fingers  the dead bug away
The Bride her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for the last five years, finally
slowly
softly
shut
They
The
She has no idea where the fuck she is - back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face
-
The     , still echoing in her ears
She lets out a and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were just shot
Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her skull where the hole was
She knocks against it with her knuckle
it goes
Suddenly she says out loud; My baby
Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen but flat
She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown and sees a   which runs down her abdomen
Her fingertips trace it
She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the lines
The     look like a road map
She stops counting, shocked; (to herself) Five years
She counts again
(a statement) Five years
The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby is long gone
She hears the
' by her head
' walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel
( ' ) - We see a  ' bright red and white Reeboks softly slapping against the smooth surface of the institution's floor
They make a sound nothing like Bill's shoes
The  listening to them            Orderly's Reeboks walking getting closer
the            down the hospital in time           corridor
with Orderly's sneakers
Orderly's face, leading two
The Bride  ' ; ' (in time)                              (in time) She's right in here
She's right in here
The ' The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets her bearings, is to play possum
She throws    herself back down on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in her bed in her coma
She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of her, creates a slightly different effect
The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when The Orderly talks she hears Bill '
The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed
He does kind of a "-" presentation of her vagina
Now is that the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw, or is that the cutest little blonde pussy, --
Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren) fronts
seen better
The She can't believe she's being exhibited in this manner
look of chagrin crosses her trying-to-be expressionless face, "'ve seen a fuck load better than you, fatass
" Yeah, in a movie - maybe
But know damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to
The price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you gittin your freak on or what
The Truckers pay the bill of fare
As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the rules; Here's the rules; Rule    number one; no punchin 'er
Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got 'er a shiner - or less    some teeth, jig's up
So no knuckle    sandwiches under no circumstances
And by the way, this little cunt's a spitter - it's a motor reflex thing but spit or no, no punchin
Now are we absolutely positively clear about rule number one
Yeah
Rule number two; No monkey bites, no hickeys - in fact no leavin no marks of no kind
But after that, it's allll goooood
Her plummin down there don't work no more, so feel free to cum in 'er all ya wont
Keep the noise down - try not to make a mess, and 'll be back in twenty
The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and turns back
He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren
Oh by the way, not all the time, but sometimes this cunt's cunt can get drier than a bucket of sand
If she dry, lube up with this and you'll be goo to go
-, gentlemen
And with that, The Orderly's gone
The ' : As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling
Warren begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly
While he looks down to accomplish this, The ' Hey Warren, she just blinked
He said she can't blink
know what he said, 'm tellin ya she just did
Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles
Just wait, when  get through with this little dumbbell, she gonna stand up and recite the Gettysburg Ad-dress
Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald
Hey, Gerald
Yeah
This shit ain't no peep show
Go out in the hall and 'll let ya know when it's your turn
Awww c'mon,  gotta leave the room
can't get no errection wit you lookin at me, so go on
Well, just hurry up then
Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway
() - Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door
He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren He bangs on the closed door and says; He man, keep it down in there, can hear your ass out here
More falsetto  behind the door
The   of a body falling
Not what the expected
'  - Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight
His buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma
He moves to his buddy, who's dead
Then moves to The comatose Bride
Who    ,  him by the front of his shirt,     , and  the in her arm    , and , turning the right side of his brain into scrambled eggs a la The
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor
The upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last five years, has just killed two men
She throws off the bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and tries to stand - The Bride is flat on the floor
Her legs and feet don't work
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning top half, and a completely useless bottom half
What's a girl to do
- The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out
The She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room
She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached to his belt
Her hands removes it
The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor
The She  the knife's   in her
The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock
The ' : He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead Truckers on the floor, and no Bride
Oh shit
as he freaks, Then
Past shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks
Once on the floor The , curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his ankles, knife ready
24
He steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and both of his    Achilles tendons
The lets out a "," adn
The Orderly  the floor face first
The boy is stunned
The  (Confined to the floor) crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor, placing his melon head between the door and the door frame
Then taking the door in her right hand
The lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness
He's in both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind, since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at The comatose Bride asking him questions
Where's Bill
(hurt and confused) Who
He screams
Bill
Where is Bill
dunno no Bill
saw him here myself
Now do you tell me where he is, or do  beat your fuckin brains in
Please please stop, don't hit me again
Where is Bill
Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck, that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill
She snatches it from around his neck
Where did you get this from
That's mine
Bullshit
saw Bill wearing it in this room ten minutes ago
Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the Orderly's hand - one spelling "
" on each finger of his left hand
And another spelling "
" on the fingers of his right
The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she does this       (We'll call it her )
- We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years ago
He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights you use    in a tent when camping
-- It gives off a soft blue light
Buck examines The Bride through the blue
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie pie they all said you wuz
Well Ma'am, 'm from Longview Texas, my name's Buck, and 'm here to fuck
He starts to unbuckle his belt
The She looks down at Buck and says; Your name's Buck, right
And you came to fuck, right
"how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face
The Bride looks down at him
The The , and the and begins to The
Every time The Bride comes face to face with a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack
By mid movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic anticipation of the carnage to come
and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land
She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown wallet that says on it, "         ," loaded with lettuce
She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it written in a pimpy font
She    gathers    up all these items, and Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly uniform
- The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a wheelchair
She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot
Her arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars, looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own
she stops
What made The Bride stop
The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4 hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side, and the words, " ," written along the flat-bed hatch door
Pimpy font
The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand
in truck door lock, it turns
'  - The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup truck
Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away
It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and
Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's still stuck hiding in the hospital
And until she regains full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin anywhere or doin anything
Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her, her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky, the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her strength, and all her concentration
on her big toe
(monotone) Wiggle your big toe
Toe doesn't move an inch
Wiggle your big toe
It doesn't move
Wiggle your big toe

: "The City of , " The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot, and the tiny establishment
The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word cozy
Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The , who smiles at her behind the midget bar
This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability
() English
() Almost -- American
() Ahhhh,
America, welcome
Welcome
My English -- Very good
The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside
She doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded, American tourist
() Domo
The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and says; () Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good, you speak Japanese
() Nooo, just a few words  learned since yesterday
- May  sit at the bar
() Sure sure sure - sit
What other words did you learn - excuse me -- The Sushi Chef   , to someone
The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to imagine there could be a back room to it
Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride
() -- What other Japanese you learn
The Bride puts on a thinking face
() Oh
let's see
"Arigato

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle
Now you're making fun of me

Pronunciation - very good
You say "Arigato"

" () Well, thank you -  mean

() You should learn Japanese - very easy

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or understand you, he yells the word; () What
And everybody always speaks  and  immediately afterwards
() always heard it was difficult
() Yes yes yes - most difficult
But you have Japanese tongue
() Maybe  was Japanese in another life
The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know; () Most definitely, most definitely Japanese in another life
He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful
() How did you know tuna's my favorite
() What
() Tuna's my favorite
() Ah, thank you very much
He      in Japanese agai

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking
() - Drink - () Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake
() Ahhh sake, (he holds up his thumb) Very good
In Japanese he / the warm sake, the little Bald Man disappears
The Bride takes a bite out of her fish
() First time in Japan

() Yes, this is my first time
As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he asks; () What brings you to Okinawa

() Aaahh, you have friend live in Okinawa
() Not quite
() Not friend
() 've never met him
The Sushi Chef continues slicing
() Who is he, may  ask
Hattori Hanzo
There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing
After a beat, he brings a bloody finger   and sticks it in his mouth
The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he pours one for The Bride, then disappears again
As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef
As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride
The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that point
and      asks; () What do you want with Hattori Hanzo
The Bride answers in Japanese; () need Japanese steel
() Why do you need Japanese steel
() have vermin to kill
() You must have big rats you need Hattori Hanzo steel
() Huge
'  - The trap door in the floor opens up, and   (Sushi Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride
The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of the second half of the attic
The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and touching the shiny wood
She looks behind her to Hanzo who is still by the trap door, and says; () May
The Sushi Chef answers in ; () Yes you may
She starts reaching for one

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath
Her hand lifts it from the rack

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor
He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards her
() wanted to show you these
However someone as you, who knows so much must surely know,  no longer make instruments of death keep these here for their ascetic and sentimental value

) Yet proud tho  am of my life's work

he closes them together) am retired
() Then give me one of these
() These are not for sale
() didn't say, sell me
said, give me
() And why should  be obliged to assist you in the extermination of your vermin
() Because my vermin, is a former student of yours
And considering the student, 'd say you had a rather large obligation
Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name, "" on it with his finger
The blonde girl nods her head yes
The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor, throwing it open
He points into a corner
() You can sleep there
starts to descend
() it will take me a week to make the sword
before his head disappears, he says; () suggest you spend it practicing

She smiles slightly
then moves over to the window, takes out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off
: "One week later" Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and read the subtitles; (

At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved the face of a lioness

; ) can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword
If on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut
() Revenge is never a straight line
It's a forest
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way
to get lost
to forget where you came in
To serve as a compass, a combat philosophy must be adopted that can be found in the secret doctrine of the Yagu Ninja
And now my yellow haired warrior, repeat after me; We go back and forth between  of  reciting the doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride repeating it
() "When engaged in combat, the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warrior's only concern
The Bride repeats this
() This is the first and cardinal rule of combat
The Bride repeats this
() Suppress all human emotion and compassion
The Bride repeats this
() Kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be Lord God, or Buddha himself
The Bride repeats this
() This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
Once it is mastered
Thou shall fear no one
Though the devil himself may bar thy way
The Bride repeats this
Her eyes look at the greatest maker of swords on this earth and says; Domo
The Hanzo Sword, her white hand with her long fingers    and removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance
: Chapter Four at : hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image, draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha regaled -
(
) When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge, at the time it seems proof like no other, that not only does God exist, you're doing his will
At a time when  knew the last about my enemies, the first name on my death list, was the easiest to find
But of course,    when one manages the difficult    task of becoming queen of the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't keep it a    secret, does one
The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes , turning into a  -
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage
(
) At the age of twenty, Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans, over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo
Japamation images of -Ren and her Army, taking on , among falling cherry blossoms
between cartoon images of this and the real life real McCoy samurai sword battle
-Ren's ability is simply amazing
(
) When it was all over, it was the geisha-regaled -Ren Ishii that proved the victor
-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the city of Tokyo
The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with standing behind them, toast their new leader, with much laughter and drinking
all except one
(
) And just in case you're wondering how could a half breed Japanese Chinese American become the boss of all criminal activity in Tokyo, Japan,
'll tell you
The subject of -Ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once
The night -Ren assumed power over the crime council
Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the alcohol-fueled frivolity
(
) The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is
Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces
The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the Tanaka Crime Family
#2 () Tanaka
What's the meaning of this outburst
This is a time for celebration
() And what exactly should  be celebrating
The perversion of our illustrious council
The Bosses all react with shock and outrage
-Ren remains cool
She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it for the rest of the sentence
- () Gentlemen
Boss Tanaka obviously has something on his mind
Allow him to express it
() My father
(looking at a clan head) along with yours and
(looking at another) along With yours, started this council
And while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today
The  react again
-Ren; - () Silence
(then composed) Of what perversion do you speak, Tanaka
Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says; () speak, Mistress Ishii,
of the perversion done to this council, which  love more than my own children,
by making a half Chinese American its leader
Then
Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,
-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed
Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body
The head hits the floor
And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of blood shoots up in the air
The  who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more flabbergasted at -Ren's resonse
The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to their swords and draw them
-Ren turns her blade in their direction
The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,
only watch
The lady looks across at the two men and says in and authoritative voice; - () Fight me or work for me
They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords
- () Drop them on the ground
They do
- () Get behind me
They do
- () Get on your knees
They do
- () Put your foreheads on the floor
They do
- () Keep your mouths shut
You better believe they do
The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her
As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for their bosses
- 'm going to say this in English so you know how serious  am
As your leader,  encourage you to -- from time to time and always in a respectful manner, and with the complete knowledge that my decision is final -- to question my logic
If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action 've decided is the wisest, tell me so
But allow me to convince you
And  will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo
except the subject that was just under discussion
- () (to a bodyguard) Hand me that head
He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen
She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks
- () The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, collect your fuckin head
(now completely American) Just like this fucker here
Now if any of you sonsabitches got anything else to say, now's the fuckin time
Nobody says anything
- () didn't think so
(pause) Meeting adjourned
- The entire -Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant
The all look up now as the crew passes
The restaurant staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on their doorstep demanding a meal
No doubt if the meal is not satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger
The door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps inside, the door is slid shut

Both girls are dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid skirts and matching blazers

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits, white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes, are her soldiers, "The  88
" , The Bride's fingers come into  and move blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way
And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans Kato mask -- that's -Ren's head of security,
They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a joke in Japanese
(
) The mop tops in black suits and Kato masks were -Ren's soldiers, "The Crazy 88
" The two young girls in the schoolgirl uniforms are her personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters
Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go Go, aged seventeen
The pretty lady who's dressed like she's a villain on Star Trek is -Ren's best friend and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale
And finally, the American in the black suit but sans Kato mask, -Ren's head of security, Mr
Barrel
-Ren hears something
Like a deer in the forest, her head springs up on alert
It's almost as if she's listening to The Bride's narration

-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a halt
Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to retrieve the eavesdropper
- The white paper door to -Ren's dining room
Yuki and Go Go step into the corridor
All trace of the Bride has vanished
They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal
Whoever was there is gone now
Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, the door behind them
The at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail
She observes all the activity by -Ren's private dining room
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off her barstool and goes through the restaurant
into the parking area
and up to her rental car
She opens the door
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides, like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death
" She tosses the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo sword
With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her back inside the restaurant
She looks upstairs to the -Ren dining room
We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open the door, and walk down the stairs together
When they get to the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the bathroom
only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way
between 's of the two women, face to face
() (to Bride) Can  help you
() Yes,  am looking for the attorney of -Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale
Would that be you

How can  help you
The Bride  her in the face
-' Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the Tokyo underworld - Mistress -Ren Ishii - and her private army doing when we cut back
Singing karaoke, of course
It's Crazy 88 's turn at the mike and he's having a whale of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in Japanese
is heard being made by the restaurant staff and the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper wall
Just as they all start to notice it, they hear; (
, ) -Ren Ishii
You and  have unfinished business
The Crazy 88 spring to their feet
One slides open the door
They see -Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand gripped around a post
She has a terrified look on her face
Before anybody on -Ren's side of the room can say anything The Bride steps out from behind Sofie
-' reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned out to be
She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's The Bride The
The Vein on her forehead begins to pulsate -  of -Ren beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel The  , we , the vein stops pulsating, and the theme ,   ,   of The Bride loaded for bear
She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the Shoulder with one stroke
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both surprise and shock
The  88 run out into the dining area and create a human wall between themselves and their Mistress
take positions on either side of -Ren
- seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet
- () You bastard
The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's blood flies off the blade
The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two warring parties
The Bride vs
The Crazy 88 The restaurant's  and  sit or stand rigidly in fear
-Ren says loudly to the room; - () Sorry everybody, but 'm afraid we're going to have to close the place
There's some private business that we must attend to now
The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits
The Bride, The Crazy 88, and -Ren hold    their ground without moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes combat
-Ren gives a simple order; - Miki
, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward, unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde
() You had it coming bastard
Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming Banzai Scream
The Bride turns to face him
Miki Charging and Screaming
The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking Position
Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her
The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to arrive
Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings
The Bride Swings
The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half
Miki looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand
The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air
Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end of a spear
Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in the
-Ren and her crew watch stunned
The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge blue splash
Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish - Red blood - Dead man
The looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into the eyes of -Ren Ishii
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered floor
The sword sticks in the floor half way
The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and -Ren and her crew at the other
Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried in the floor
The    red circle grows larger
and larger
and larger
and larger    still
Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee, and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo underworld
-Ren her eyes narrow with rage
She screams out another order; - () Tear the bitch apart
The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same time with a
They circle the Bride
The Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her
She Whips the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in front of her
Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel
Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her
The six Crazy 88 Attack
The does a Zatoichi-like -- with her steel blade
Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death, ,     , ,        , The last two put up more of a fight
but then one of them is and  and the last one is the restaurant's big picture window
The of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet, they Look back up at -Ren
- standing in between Go Go and Mr
Barrel
Her eyes narrow
The swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead attackers flies off
and unsheath their swords
We hear a   of many  behind the Bride
Then behind her, through the broken pictures window we see seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot
All the riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry samurai swords
The looks from the reinforcements to -Ren
- smiles
- () (to the     Bride) You didn't     think it was going to be that easy,     did you
() (to -Ren) You know, for a second there, yeah did
-Ren smiles
- () Silly rabbit
Both -Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,
-/ Trix Are for kids
This is something they used to say back when they fought alongside of each other as "Vipers
" The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride
As a     begins to , The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western Stand-off
We do a 360  the  of The Crazy 88, who surround the yellow-haired warrior
Not all have Samurai swords; one , another   - over his head
As the Heavy Metal music builds
We Cut to various Shots of The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike
Hands on Sword Handles
Feet finding Combat Stance
etc
Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point
At that point, the Metal The As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish
She's a Goddess of War Venus
Not only is the       , but The Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights
This explosion of furious violence is punctuated , and the fight being filmed in     , turning the squirting, spewing geysers of Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's blade
Some While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang out of its holster, and Throws it
It Twirls Through the Air
Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces
The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him
Slash, he's Out
The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air, Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck
She throws him down to the ground
With his neck still in the vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The  Knife from its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest
While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends It Flying in the Charging Man's path
Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground
Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he falls flat
The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders
She locks her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off
she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands off
So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine foot tall Bride fights with the others
When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's perched on's throat
He falls to his knees, bringing the Bride back to the floor like an alevator
As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders, somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an attacker's legs into his groin
He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free
steps out from the rest, "The Best One
" He Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to, "Come get a piece
" The Bride does a screaming charge towards him
Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm - steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to collide
They meet
-  -  -  -  -  -  - -  -  -  - They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a mistake
It's the male
The Bride's swing, that's neither clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm
The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the floor
The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of his chest
Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain alive, or intact
They start to approach
The Bride, still holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker, backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining killers
Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the action, to rest on her feet
yanks the blade from his chest cavity
The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and Crashes to the floor
The Attackers start to close in
The Bride readies herself for their attack
(in perfect time with the Heavy Metal)
Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped over on its shell
Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground
Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of her head, and Pops back up on her feet
And then there were seven
The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the floor
Now spread out, they make a large half-circle
The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor, lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head
In repose
The Bride's eyes pointed up, watch them move closer, We see her face is splashed with blood
- a red fan
stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the switch
The room goes dark
The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still on the floor
Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows
As she breathes in and out, The Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness)
The Bride rises to her feet
The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in rhythm with the Metal
The Heavy Metal Music builds
to a big finish
both Music and The Bride Explode
- With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue
The snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage
The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue backdrop
They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and death
The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all sword-weilding partners
She --- with all of them - They seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then --- again, with The Bride killing or hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride crouches down low in repose while the others continue to circle stalk
She Strikes again
We Cut in closer whenever we need to
Finally the last of -Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's sword
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the lights back on
The electricity shines light on
The Splashed all over with blood
Blood painting the floor, walls and ceiling
Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded men who have yet to die, litter the ground
With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of -Ren's subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade
Then saying to the foes who litter the ground
() Those    of you lucky enough to still have    your lives
Take them with you
But leave the limbs you've lost
They belong to me now
The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant
The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last remaining combatants
Mr
Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and -Ren Ishii
Go Go steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai sword
It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain
She begins  it above her head
Each rotation makes a sound in the air
in a 3--like effect, the metal ball comes right at us
The ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk of wood post behind her
Go Go eyes focused on her enemy
she lets fly
The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo sword
Go Go yanks
the Hanzo sword  out of her grip
smiles
then
The removes her boomerang and  it at Go Go
The through the air heading right for Go Go
The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and chain
She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on the floor
She looks    across at her opponent
she
It Strikes the Bride in the chest, knocking her    on her back
Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the Bride on the floor
The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal ball  a hole in an overturned table instead
The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its purpose
She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight
Go Go hops up on a table
As they fight they hop from table to table
Go Go throws her ball and chain
The Bride -
it away with the table leg
Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain
it wraps around the Bride's ankle
Go Go
The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she through another table
Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai short sword
The Bride uses the table leg to block it
The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly with struggle
Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to the Bride's mouth
the Bride   on it
Go Go screams as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she rolls off the Bride
The Bride comes at her, bringing the table leg --     -- --- The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and delivers a powerful "
" to the Bride from below, dropping her to her knees
-Ren is , and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and begins to strangle
The chain digs into the Bride's throat
The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her flesh
the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat with them
Go Go lets out a horrific scream
The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young girl's white tennis shoe
The nails stick in, the white shoe becomes stained with red
Go Go  letting loose of the chain
falling on the floor
The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins breathing air into her lungs
Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her
The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's weapon above her head
Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second floor
The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the ball and chain over her head
Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs
She gets to the top
The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain
It  the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari sisters, smack  in the back of the head
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind it
We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit shatter like a teapot
Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari  down the staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet
Dead before the tumble began
The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor
Her eyes go to the last two remaining combatants
Mr
Barrel and -Ren Ishii
() Any more subordinates for me to kill, -Ren
Mr
Barrel says; One last one
You're Mr
Barrel, right
And you're Black Mamba
Our reputations precede us
Apparently
Tell me Mr
Barrel, why don't you wear your Kato mask
Are you and iconoclast
Mr
Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes
don't like that rubber band
It fucks up my hair
You shouldn't work for her
Too late
It's not too late to quit
Do you have choices
No
know exactly how you feel
This has nothing to do with You and , and everything to do with me taking satisfaction from that bitch behind you
And there's absolutely positively no way ' going to leave here without taking that satisfaction
So Mr
Barrel, you have to stand aside
And that means you must quit, right now
can't
Yes you can
No  can't
Don't say "Can't", there are no "Cant's
" Yes - You - Can
- Screams at her "
last line of defense;" - () What are you waiting for
Are you on a date
Attack her you fool
Oh my God
(pause) She just called you a fool
She just called you a fool in front of me
Not only am  your opponent
'm a female fellow countryman
And you're going to risk your life - to say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool
- is furious, and slaps Mr
Barrel on the shoulder
- () Attack, Goddamn you
The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she just saw
Mr
Barrel spins in -Ren's direction shooting her a look she's never seen from him before
He then looks back to the Bride
Her eyes are waiting for his
She says with just the slightest hint of plea in her voice; 'll owe ya one
He looks at her a  longer
then says as he resheaths his sword; The things  do for a pretty face
: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The Handle locks into place with a Click
He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and says; () quit
-Ren fries and egg on her head
Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn room   and out the front door
As he walks, when he's parallel with   the Bride, He stops and    says; About that one you owe me
Yes
'm gonna collect someday, you know
'll be disappointed if you don't
He continues walking without a look back
Before he Exits the restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says; Tough luck bout that arm Sofe
He exits the Movie
- and The match eyes
The Japanese gal says; - () Very funny
(pause) Your instrument is quite impressive
() Domo
- () Where was it made
Okinawa
- () Whom in Okinawa made you this steel
This is Hattori Hanzo steel
- () The Bride just smiles at her rival's response
-Ren's composure returns
- () Swords however never get tired hope you've saved your energy
If you haven't, you might not last five minutes
(pause) Have you seen the garden in this establishment
() No
- () Oh, you really should
It's quite beautiful
Allow me
-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire battle
She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white paper wall and slides it open
, set against a Jet Black sky
Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside
Snow falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but Operatic/Theatrical)
-Ren stands next to the Bride in the doorway looking out into the white night
- () As last looks go, you could do worse
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside
The Bride follows her
-   - As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance from one another
, but not Japanese drums - Spanish Flamenco Guitar
The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly
Holding it out in front of her
Tip of Blade pointed at -Ren
Sword's Handle and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her cheek
Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade
Snow falls around her
-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride
She raises up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face vertically
then begins slowly unsheathing it
Snow falls around her
-' White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow underneath them
The Holding Sword
Eyes reflected in Blade
her Yellow Sneakers Crunching snow underneath them
- when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird
The Two Women circle each other
They  -  -  -
- -  -
-  in the air does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her opponent
She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing
The across her back - Spinning her around
-Ren goes in for the kill
The Bride meets her blade
The Blades Clash and Lock
The Two Women's faces come together as the Blades become entangled
-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into The Bride's mouth
Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on her ass in a koi pond
- The Combat Guitar Stops - -Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs; - () Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade
Now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight
You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai
The Combat Guitar starts again
As The Bride slowly rises out of the koi pond
She brings up her sword and Says Calmly to -Ren in Japanese; () Attack me
With everything you have
The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with The Bride's Striking -Ren - not fatally - but deep
They separate
breathing hard
Cold Air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives
-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride
The respect for the Bride's ability is transparent
The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again
Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers
Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down legs staining White Socks with Red
They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair
They Swing - Twist - Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off
Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs, leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females have the same thought
The next clash    will be their last
- () apologize for ridiculing you earlier
() Accepted
They continue breathing
() Ready
- () Yes
The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle each other for their final attack
With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay
They Find themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall
The Bride and -Ren both begin Running diagonally through the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their Samurai hearts out
They both
can't tell who got who
,      , landing in the white snow
- facing away from the Bride
Sword still in her hand
We see she doesn't have the
touch of her is exposed
Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just ended with one swing, stares off into space
- () That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword
Her sword  from her grip
in the snow by her feet
- () always dreamed of owning one
-Ren  to her knees, toppling forward
Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says; - () Did he make it for you
() Yes
The Last thing she says before she dies; - () He must of liked you
With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and she's gone
The removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list, off her Hanzo Steel
is returned back to its sheath
The '  that Hanzo carved into the wood seems pleased
: The now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her head, stands  in a
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her
The  slams the trunk,
The  driving down the road at supersonic speed
The behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet
It looks like an insert from "
" car speeding
then stopping
The  lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her  in the Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly Viper syringe in her hand
When she speaks it comes out of a   at the bottom of the helmet
Turning her voice deeper and electronically spooky
The two women speak Japanese to each other
() 've kept you alive for one reason
Information
Being -Ren's lawyer, take it you're familiar with Bill
() Yes
() In fact, 'd guesstimate, you worked for Bill before -Ren, and that's how it is you came to work for -Ren
Am  correct
() Yes
() thought so
Give me the arm you have left
() Why
() want information
Now gimme your arm
Sofie offers up her remaining arm
She injects Sofie with the gold syringe
() The cocktail racing    through your bloodstream at this    moment is Bill's own recipe
He calls it "The Undisputed Truth
" Sofie is injected
() Okay, first things first
Where was the other Yubari sister
Yuki
() Yuki's sick
She went home early
() Do tell
What's wrong with her
() She has a cold
() Awwww poor baby
What do you think she'll do when she finds out what happened
() She'll wail with grief
upon hearing the news of her sister's death
She
She'll drink excessively
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up
She'll start trouble
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor
An    in a business suit sits next to her at the bar
he puts the make on her
() Do you like Ferraris
Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice; () Ferrari
Italian trash
She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the business suit
() Do you find me hot
The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she gets annoyed; () Don't laugh
Do you want to fuck me, yes or no
() Yes
He lets out a  coming from below
We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen, creating a big red grin across his mid-section
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated
She opens him up more
he feels every inch of the blade's progress
() How bout now, big boy, do you still wish to penetrate me
Blade cuts deeper
() Or is it  who has penetrated you
And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor
() When she stops shedding tears, she'll start shedding blood
() Best guess, what will she do
() don't hafta guess, she'll come after you
() Will she ever give up
() She won't have to
When she finds you,  don't know who will win
But what  do know is, she will find you
() Is she more skilled than
() Skilled won't be the word
() Don't be coy with me, bitch
What would be the word
Crazy
The Bride takes this in
then moves on
() Okay, now  want all the information on the Deadly Vipers,
What they've been doing and where  can find them
- The big hospital of  is located by a hill by the highway
Sofie's  pulls off the highway to the side
The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the hill
Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the huge hospital
: in a hospital environment
Bill's voice speaks to her ; (
; ) Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, 'm so sorry
() Please forgive my betrayal -- He shhhh's her off screen; (
; ) -- no more of that
invented that truth serum
Once it entered your bloodstream, you no longer had a choice
() But, still -- (
; ) -- But still -- nothing, except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie
(pause) If you had to guess why she left you alive, what would be your guess
() Guessing won't be necessary
She informed me
() 'm allowing you to keep your wicked life for one reason and one reason only
So you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight
want him to witness the extent of my mercy
, by witnessing your deformed body want you to tell him, all the information you just told me want him to know what  know want him to know  want him to know
Then with  -  we see through the helmet to the Bride's face inside as she says the last line
() And  want them all to know, they'll all soon be as dead as of to a  of Bill says off screen; (
; ) If -Ren was number one, unless she's being tricky, Vernita Green will be number two
() Where is Vernita Green
(
, ) Los Angeles
Vernita's in Pasadena
But the woman you want will hold up in a low budget motel, fifteen of twenty minutes away from stepping on board a plane departing
If had to bet
'd say Hawthorne
Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in English; () California, here  come
: He's sewing something that requires a lot of concentration
The ' What he's sewing is, the   -Ren gave the Bride on her back, closed with a simple needle and thread
The lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her flesh
The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see she's filled with a terrible resolve
As Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the Bride recites in Japanese after him
: - ' name written in the Bride's notebook with the number one next to it
black felt pen comes into frame and draws a line through the name
: Chapter five ' We hear music under this card
coming to Los Angeles cut to music
We see  dressed in her Japanese private schoolgirl outfit with white blouse, plaid skirt, bobby socks, blazer, and barrettes in her hair, flying on a jet enroute to Los Angeles
She paints her fingernails with bubble gum-colored nail polish
Yuki walks through
Yuki standing next to a   on a California car lot
She points at a car in front of her
We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger pointing at it
We see Yuki behind the wheel of the sports car, driving as fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood Hills, laughing all the way
We see Yuki running around all over , Hollywood and Disneyland taking pictures with her disposable Barbie camera

During their face-off we only see the Bride at a distance
The Bride is in the b
g
, back to us packing her trunk, just about ready to make a clean getaway
Yuki yells to the figure across the street
() Conigute wa
We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze upon hearing the Japanese greeting
Without turning around she says; () Conigute wa
(pause) Yuki
() Bingo
begins on the soundtrack
The Bride turns around to face the young avenger
() Can  help you
() You can kill yourself
Yuki giggles
() Taking a trip
() was
() You still are
One way
() know you feel you must avenge your sister
But  beg you
walk away
Yuki giggles
() You call that begging
You can beg better than that
Yuki giggles
Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches on the beam
() Can  see your    face
've heard your beauty is    exquisite
would like to see for    myself
() Sure
Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face
() Ohhhh,
look how pretty your face is
Oooohhh,
want to touch it
Domo
() Your face is so    pretty,  just want to put both of    my palms against your cheeks and    give you little tiny kisses
Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face
() How do  look
() Very pretty
() You're just saying that 'cause told you how pretty you are
() Yuki, you're gorgeous
() Really
Is that how you'd describe me to somebody if  wasn't here
Yuki's gorgeous
() You bet
Yuki giggles
() Don't make me kill you
() Okay
Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back and      of firepower at The Bride
The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy wagon is demolished by the ammo
The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of front lawns
Yuki chases her with machine gun fire
The Bride  over a long hedge
disappearing Behind it
Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the hedge
The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and rolls under a Volkswagen van
Bullet   all around the Bride as she rolls out on the other side
She removes her 9mm automatic and returns fire from behind the van
Yuki yells to her in English; () You think you're safe
say; Ha
She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth, and slides it towards the Bride
The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on the asphalt towards her
She takes off running
as the Volkswagen van She cuts through the backyard of a house -- -- over their fence, in the backyard over the fence into another yard
She trips, falling into the other house's swimming pool
Instead of splashing around, the Bride swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow end
Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front of the house
It's located on a cul de sac
Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street
Both women see the other
Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of her car as she speeds down the dead-end street
The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and automobiles
When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,
She jerks the wheel
the car around, pointing it in the opposite direction
the cars lining the street
In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back
Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around
She gets ready to make a third pass
Some  in the house behind the Bride, look out of their front door
The Bride yells at them; Stay in your house and stay down on the floor
Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her
The Bride runs into the house she's in front of
She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door
Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house
She stands up in the convertible
Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and says; () Time for the rabbit to come out of her hole
She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself face down on the lawn
The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters
Everybody in the kitchen is blown back
Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms
Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand
The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall
Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg
The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway
The Bride crashes to the floor --  -- blood pours out of her gunshots
Yuki charges up the stairs
machine gun blazing, tearing up the house
The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge
Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the hallway
The Bride fires
The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking her through a bedroom doorway
(to herself) Gotcha
Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain
She yells from the doorway into the hallway; () You fucking bitch
You shot me in my breast
They're not fully developed yet, you fucking asshole
Now 'm always gonna have a dimple
The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top
() Piss me off
She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up everything around the Bride
When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells; () Yuki, in about two    minutes there's going to be an army    of police here
So if you're gonna    kill me, now's the time
From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue powder
It gives her energy
(
, ) So what's it gonna be bitch
Slapping a new clip in her machine gun
() That fucking does it
Yuki comes around the corner  her machine gun in the Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her
The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm
The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat
Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style
Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs
The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead
Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed
then they pop up open
Guess what
she's    not dead
Though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises
Her head turns in the    direction of the Bride
The Bride sees this and can't believe it
They lock eyes
Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream
She charges up the steps at the Bride
The startled Bride fires at her
the 9mm's empty
Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high
The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster
Yuki chargin
The Bride cocks back the hammer
Yuki charging, getting closer
The Bride Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging
The Bride fires again
Yuki jerks but keeps on charging
Bride fires
Yuki jerks, but keeps charging
Bride fires
Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high
The Bride Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty
The Bride fires, but her gun jams
Yuki leaps on her with the knife
They struggle for a moment
The Bride realizes Yuki's dead
She tosses her to the side
Goddamn, what a wildcat
'  - The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a name tag on it that reads, "
Owens," answers the phone
Hello
The Bride on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number written on the back that says, "
Owens," and her phone number
She's bleeding from her five bullet holes
Sitting in a pool of her own blood
She's starting to tremble
We can't see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood planks
The moon shines into the structure
Hello, 'm calling Nurse Owens -- Who is this
You don't know me, but -- -- And  don't want to neither
Now don't know how you got my number, but you can just rip that shit up, because -- -- 've been shot five times -- -- Stop,  don't wanna hear no more

'm dying
Then bitch, you better call yourself a ambulance, cause  don't do this shit no more

--    No, you can call a ambulance, you    just don't want to
But if your ass    is really dying, you ain't got no    motherfuckin choice
do have a choice, and 'm choosing to call you
If you refuse to help me, 'll die
And that will be your choice
Bitch,  don't even know you
What do you need to know
'm from Earth, 'm a woman, 'm dying, and only you can help me
Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse
Okay, where you at
'm in Hawthorne
'm hiding in a kids treehouse
It's a street called, "Dimmick"
1-7-3-6 Dimmick Avenue
There's a bunch of police cars and firetrucks, about two blocks away
Whatcha do, crawl two blocks
If you can't walk, you better crawl
Nurse Owens likes that last line
You got you some money dontcha, or am  doin this out of the goodness of my heart
You come and get me, today's pay day
You ain't too far away
You gonna bleed to death  get there in a half a hour
Probably
Okay, 'll be there in fifteen minutes
Is that Pacific Standard Time, or Just you better be there    when  get there, and you better be    shot five times, and your bony ass    better be on your last motherfuckin    legs
How do you know  have a bony ass
You sound like you have a bony ass
The Nurse hangs up the phone
- The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens
Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor
Glad you made it
There's cops all over here,  had to be cool
They tend to notice things like Negroes sneaking around people's backyards
The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey
What's that
This shit's gonna hurt, and  ain't got no anesthetic
(refers to the bottle) So git busy
'  - The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the nurse extracts the bullets
The Bride screams
The  is turned up loud to hide the screams
The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three cigarette butts and other balls of lead
The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior; That fuckin smarts
Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says; Yeah, bullets are bad news
In the future, you should avoid them if you can
'll keep that in mind
So, do have a future
You'll live to kill again
Splendid
She passes out
: Chapter six "Can she bake a cherry pie
" is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side
(
) Yes
(
) heard you had a game
(
) Who are you
(
) They call me Bill
(
) Bill what
(
) That, no one ever calls me
says to the Doorman; (
) Open the door Alburt, let's see what this Bill looks like
The door opens revealing  to the other side of the door, and for the first time, to the audience
He looks cool
- Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into a crap game
crap table has been erected in the middle of the suite
stand around the table trying their luck
All playing has stopped at the opening of the door
One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of the table
It's her game
her name is
'
Bill stands in the doorway
the doorman, who wears a tux, waits for
's word
' Are you a policeman, Bill
Not anymore
laughs
Let him play, Alburt
Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest
(to the players) We now return to the game already in progress
The point is nine gentlemen, nine is the point
As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room
There are five other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss 'Boyle
In his hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword
Referring to the sword; 'll take that
You'll have to
The two men stare
Now now boys
Mr
Bill, do you intend to start any shit with that sword
give you my word of honor,  will start nothing
Good enough for me
(back to game) Miss 'Boyle required a two-hundred dollar membership fee
That's rather pricey
You wanna play for free, go to Vegas
You start now you'll be there by sundown
Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull to death
He peels off two hundred
think 'll stay here
'm thirsty
That way
Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a   tends it
Beer
Twenty dollars
Twenty dollars for a beer
High cost of living shooter
You don't like it, go to Vegas
You can get a prime rib dinner there for 3
95
What am  going to do, 'm thirsty
(throws a 20 on the bar) Pour the beer
The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer inside the can
She then offers only the cup to Bill
(pointing to the can) don't get that
The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no
He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says; Cheers
Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer
Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid in school wants    to play right away
(to Bill) How bout it new    kid, you wanna handle my bones,    or do you just like to watch
Dropping his money roll on the table
came to play
Color
impressed
Boys take a look at this man, he's what Webster's calls, a gambler
The dice belong to you , sir
With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill
He takes them and inspects them
hope you're not implying anything, friend
(as he inspects dice) 'm not implying anything
Alburt starts to move from his position by the door
That did it fuckhead, you're out the door -- motions him back to his position
The players watch
And Bill, an opposite ends of the table, trade quips
Bill looks from the dice to
You looked me over when  stood in your doorway
'm looking you over as  step up to your table
If don't know,  don't throw
Are you satisfied
More or less
think we're getting into a antagonistic relationship
Oh, 'm sorry,  thought you were trying to take my money, and  was trying to take yours
It's just a game
Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room reacts
If you're game, take my bet sportsman
Covered
Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then throws
7
The room reacts
smiles and pushes the money and the dice back to Bill with her stick
He picks up his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says; Shoot it all
The room reacts
Covered
He holds the dice in his fist
and throws
5
The point is five, gentlemen, five is the point
Bill throws
5
more reaction
more money
Shoot it all
Covered
He shoots again, he wins again
in front of him
Bill picks up the stack of moola
Stands behind her table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent
In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off
His eyes go to it
It reads;
He raises his eyes from the beeper to
, casually tosses the green on the felt and says; Shoot it all
Pretty lucky tonight, huh
Play a game of luck long enough you're bound to meet some lucky people
You know we've never been properly introduced, 'm
'Boyle
And 'm not interested
No, you're rude
Why so rude rude boy, 'm only trying to be friendly
didn't come here to make friends
came here to shoot a little crap
But then your boy over there hits me up for a two hundred dollar privilege to play fee -- -- That's a membership fee, good for -- -- You and nobody else
You sell at the bar a half can of warm piss, at twenty bucks a shot
How much did the six-pack cost you
5
60, 5
65
You're greedy 'Boyle
You're just too Goddamn greedy
You know what like to do when  meet greedy people
Take every fuckin thing they got
Leave em with nothing
So that's your game, you want to teach me a lesson
wanna    burn you    down
When 'm through    with you,    you won't have a pot to    piss, or a    window to throw it out    of
You'll    thumb a ride out of
wearing a    barrel
could always save myself this horrible fate by not taking your bet
To be replaced by a different fate
The embarrassing truth that you run a gutless game
won't forget it
'm sure these gentlemen won't forget it
'm sure they'll tell people who won't forget it
And we won't come back
If we don't come back, you won't get our money
Couple of weeks, you won't have a game
You got a big mouth, lucky boy
And the idea of taking everything you've won away, and sending you out the door with nothing but a red face, is so appealing to me, that will take your bet
But
not with those dice
Oooohhh, that's
The house's perogative and you know it
She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards
She sets the dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her stick
Bill looks down at them
Maybe you would like to change your bet
Yes  would
Shoot it all
Against myself
His hand scoops the dice off the table
He catches the young lady by surprise
What
Did  stutter, 'm changing my bet
'm betting  don't make it
From the door Alburt says; You can't do that
Oh yes  can
It's the shooter's perogative, and she knows it
Covered
He throws
The spectators go apeshit
Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he just busted
Can  use your phone
Sure it's next to the bed
Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone
In the b
g
is throwing everybody out
Game's over, get out
Get the fuck out
No more tonight, go home
(into phone) Vernita's dead
When
(pause) What about her family
(pause) Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone completely apeshit
No idea where she is
(pause) Okay that did it, we're going to Texas and talk sense into Budd before () makes him number three
He looks over and
is sitting on the floor of the bed
All the players have left, only
and her five tuxedo boys remain
We're going to have a talk about this later
(pause) Well, 'm not exactly among friends at the moment
(pause
he laughs) 'll keep that in mind, bye bye
He hangs up
Got a nose problem
said you could use my phone didn't say  wouldn't listen
This is true
You didn't burn me down you know
Course not
First rule of any house, ya gotta have comes in and wipes the place out insurance
If there weren't losers it wouldn't be a game
Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket pocket, looking at
and her boys, he says; sincerely hope you mean that
Without another word he exits the hotel room
Nobody makes a move to stop him
'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for the sound of the elevator in the hall
The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack; (
) What
'Boyle didn't know was, the real game was just beginning
Bill was on the job, and she was the target
Now Bill was the greatest assassin of the 20th century
In fact the term was coined for him
And he rarely performs actual assassinations anymore
However every once in awhile - to keep his hand in - he does
Only he plays a game
He doesn't start big trouble
he lets them start it
If they do, they're dead
If they don't, not only won't he perform, he'll take the hit off the market
It's kind of fun watching people gamble when they don't know they're gambling, isn't it
They hear the elevator in the hall
'Boyle tells her men; Get my money back
Don't kill him
Chop off all his fingers
Alburt smiles
The Five men go out the door
The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to see
, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the end
This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords
He Charges at them
In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men
His mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless
He cuts through    the first four rather quickly
The fifth one, Alburt, is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's blade
'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the front door
She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for that matter, to step through the doorway
The window her back is up against , and a black gloved hand reaches inside and  her by her hair, and her out the window
- Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor), outside
'Boyle's room
He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side by her hair
Do you know a Jessica
Is too hysterical to answer
Well, she knows you
He drops her
Bill watches her all the way down
When he's confident her fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge
: Chapter seven "The lonely grave of Paula Schultz" '  - small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle of a barren Texas wasteland
under this image; "The city of Austin Texas
" fist knocks on the trailer door
It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother,
Not the Slick Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live there
Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his natural habitat
In    the
we can see Elle Driver lounging in the passenger's    seat
Budd, surprised by the visitor, says; Great day in the morning
Brother Bill livin up to his familia obligation
How ya doin' Budd
Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women
Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear
Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch in the passenger seat
It's Elle
Want to say hello
Never said "bye," can't seem to think of a reason to say, "hi
" :
- ' Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air conditioner
She watches the brotherly scene play out through the car windshield
Obviously there's no love lost between Elle and Budd
What'd ya wanna talk about
Are you not going to invite me in
No
May  ask why not
It stinks in there, that's why
Now what's so important it requires a reunion
The estranged brothers continue their conversation
Budd sits in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand
Bill stands
You tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty-eight bodyguards 'fore she got to -Ren
No
There wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves The Crazy 88
Why
dunno,  guess they thought it sounded cool
Anyhow, she had about 26 or 27 around her when () attacked
They all fell under her Hanzo sword
The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention
She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword
Bill nods his head, "yes
" She has a Hanzo Jingi sword
He made her one
Didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another sword
It would appear he's broken it
Budd doesn't say anything at first
; Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don't they
Or is it just you tend to bring that out in people
(pause) know this is a ridiculous question before  ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay
Hell,  pawned that years ago
You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword
Yep
The disrespect is pain
It was priceless
Not in El Paso it ain't
In El Pso got me 250 Dollars for it
Since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back
Because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence
Drunken bum though  may be, don't need booze that bad
But who the hell gives a crap anyway
That bitch ain't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword
'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill
If she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight
-- Budd, you need to listen to me
know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant
But you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of Bea
Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you
And unless you accept my assistance, have no doubt she will succeed
Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare
Bill tries to charm his brother
Can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this
Budd chuckles
And what would that happy side be
She's brought "the boys" back together
Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself
appreciate the concern on your face, but there's a difference 'tween "the boys", time can't erase
don't dodge guilt
And don't Jew outta payin my comeuppance
That woman deserves her revenge
And we deserve to die
But then again, so does she
So guess we'll just see now, won't we
--- - The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works at
His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had when    they came in
His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile
--- - Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar
No strippin goin on yet, just a few  drinkin
The owner, , yells at him as he walks by
You're late, Budd, this shit ain't school, ya know
Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back, passing by a  serving drinks
Hey, Budd
Hey, Lucky
walks out of the ladies' room and says to him; Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at it again
There's shitty water all over the floor
'll take care of it, Suzie Pie
--- - brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking lot and stops
The sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front door
Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a rubberband
Then places a baseball cap on the top of her noggin that reads, "'  -
" She steps out of the truck's cab
She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a " :   " tee-shirt
--- - The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage explodes into honky tonk guitar
She walks up to the bar and oders a; Shiner
The  gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock
As she drinks the Texas brew
Watches the
The crowd
Looking for Budd among the crowd
She sees him
He's the bouncer
She observes him
he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his head to the music
into her eyes;   plays on the soundtrack
Her hand removes her sog from its sheath
She moves through the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd sitting oblivious on his stool
Suddenly a   stands up from his table -- spilling every bottle and glass on it -- and  all over
Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area
The Bride
observes Him
- As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his pickup on an empty highway home from work
He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the side of the road
After    he whizzes by, she starts up the motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on
She follows him, hanging way back in the    dark
Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness, trailing him
'   - Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper home
He walks inside, shutting the door behind him
The Bride rolls to a stop
Observing the lonely trailer out of her windshield
Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper
We see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice
The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai sword
She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute member of the audience will read the significance of her choice
His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The Bride satisfaction was a warrior
And it's that Budd she intends to send to his maker
She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath
Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose
Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door, and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air
On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer
Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat
Their fight makes a  racket
The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt
From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off the phonograph
From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking out the window of the camper
The Bride keeps her face in the dirt
The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the claws of a cat
The curtain closes again
The needle is placed back on the phonograph
The face in the dirt
One Mississippi
Two Mississippi
her eyes look up towards the trailer
All's clear
She begins crawling towards the trailer again
She's now right outside the trailer home
We can hear the sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth
She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed
The sound of pouring in a glass
The sound of a glass being laid heavy on a table
Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care, slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword
Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted image of Budd's feet on the floor
She slowly rises
removes her black stocking cap
blonde hair falls around her shoulders
sword in right hand
left hand grabs the front doorknob
as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's handle down hard on the door lock -- Cheap Lock Busting
She flings the front door open
The ' : Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a -  aimed right at The Bride
: The Bride Blinks
Both barrels  in our face
The standing in the doorway is    in the chest, and the
Landing hard on her back in the dirt
Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music
Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at The Bride
' : The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from her throat
Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over The Bride
Bet your sweet ass that don't sting like a bitch
More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride
You done got a double dose of rock salt, right in the ole tit
Now not havin tits as fine or as big as yours,  can't even imagine how bad that shit stings
He lowers down on his haunchers, over her
But  don't wont to neather
The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast, still nevertheless defiant,  a gob of bloody saliva, right in ole Budd's face
Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose
The cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes away the goo
Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter
Now  know when it    comes to a rock salt burn, you're    feelin pretty much like a expert    bout now
But truth be told, you    ain't felt all rock salt's got to    offer till you took a double dose    in your backside
With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto her stomach, exposing her butt
the barrel closed, he takes aim and  both barrels --   -- right into her keister
The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any opponent during the movie up till now
Her head rears back and she lets out a
That gentled ya down, didn't it
Yep
ain't nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their backyard
Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious
Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna, and presses one button on the panel
'  - The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename "California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout with her
This is one white bitch who can kick some serious  ass
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the sound of a  ), her boxing Coach buys the farm
Elle on cell phone
We cut Back and Forth
Bill
Wrong brother, you hateful bitch
Budd
Bingo
And what do  owe this dubious pleasure
just caught me the cowgirl, ain't never been caught
This gets Elle's attention
Do you mean what  think you mean
If you think  mean  got 'er, you thought right
Did you kill her
Not yet  ain't
But  can sure do it easy enough
She's so gentle right now,  could preform her coup de grace with a rock
What are you waiting for, run outta liquid courage
No
It's just
ain't killed nobody in a long Goddamn time
And just 'tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a promise wasn't gonna
Be that however it is
Back when  did kill people got paid for it
Just don't seem right
turn amateur this time of life
We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange
(
) Anywho, guess what 'm holdin in my hand right now
We cut back to Budd's side
And what he's holding is The Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword
brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo sword
And 'm here to tell ya Elle, that's what  call sharp
How much
Oh, that's hard to say
Seein it's priceless and all
'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for it
'm sure you would
But 'll take, one million
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you were such a capitalist
thought drunks like yourself were beyond such monetary concerns
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a whole lotta Jack
Why then are you selling it to a hateful bitch like me, when you know Bill would pay more
If 'm gonna drink myself to death, it won't be on Bill's dollar
It's gonna be on yours
What's the terms
You buy a ticket to Texas, and 'll see you here tomorrow mornin
You give me a million in foldin cash, 'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man
How's that sound
Sounds like we got a deal
One condition
What
You kill her tonight
(pause) And one more thing
You said one condition
It's a caveat to the same condition
What
She must suffer to her last breath
That Elle darlin,  can pretty damwell guarantee
Then 'll see you in the morning millionaire
: -
- We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard
Tombstones
Graves
Dirt
Low-hanging fog
This could be the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie
We also see (one which is Budd, the other which is ) digging up a grave
Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot too
Its headlight beams shining on the two men
And last but not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed of Budd's pickup
The She begins to come to from the shot in her arm
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds
Rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her
big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots
Her eyelids flutter open
and she sees stars
giant, black Texas night sky full of them
She has no idea where she is
She turns her head to the left and sees, Back window and Cab of truck
She turns her head to the right and sees, Hatch Gate to flatbed
She listens
she hears, Crickets
The sound of Two Men Digging
One of the Men says something to the other in Spanish
She hears one of the Shovels  something buried
The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish
We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a coffin
The Bride however knows not what to think
They set it down
She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of leaves leading in her direction
With a  and a  the latches on the Gate of the flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a
Revealing Budd, looking down on her
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey
The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck
She  to the dirt
Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been dup up
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of "Fistful of Dollars
" And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads; "
" Budd and Ernie stand over her
The Bride just  up at the two tormentors, with the only weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare
Budd turns to Ernie and says in , subtitled in English; () Look at those eyes
This bitch is furious
You grab her feet, 'll get her head
() Got anything to say
The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she won't give it to them
() In America white women call this the silent treatment
(laughing) And we let 'em think, we don't like it
The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and carry her over to the pine box
She struggles with her bound legs and arms
Both men  her to the ground
Budd whips out a can of mace from his pocket
Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at this
He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes
She stops
Her eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd
Looky here bitch, this is a can of mace
Now you're goin underground tonight, and that's all there is to it
But, when  bury ya,  was gonna bury you with this
He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the beam
But if    you're gonna act like    a horse's    ass, 'll spray this    whole Goddamn    can in your eyeballs
Then you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried alive
So what's it gonna be sister
Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight
You may be stupid, but at least you ain't bloody stupid
The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine box and place her in
Budd puts the flashlight inside
He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over the coffin
He locks eyeballs with The Bride
her eyes hold his for as long as she can, he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin
with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut
Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between the lid and the box
However with each nail pounded in, more lights is cut off
the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head
The last hammered nail obliterates that light source
The Bride lies in
- The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave
Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt
turn on the flashlight
The by the flashlight beam
a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making The Bride jump
More dirt
She reacts again
The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with each new shovelful
The Bride is starting to perspire
her breathing becoming more rapid and panicked
her heartbeat begins to echo inside the pine box
We've never seen her like this before
She's starting to lose it
She lets out a
She again
Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the lid
She pounds on it
Her bound feet kick up at it
She starts to cry
She's getting hysterical
Her fingers begin clawing at the wood lid
They're ripped open and bleeding
Leaving Blood Trails on the wood
She exhausts herself
All this while, she's been screaming the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth; Help me
The Bride halts her hysteria
She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face, mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever she came    from
The woman we know as The Bride is back
She talks to    herself
Well, now that you've had a nice, good cry, let's figure out how to get out of here
You're breathing like you just been fuckin
Calm down
close your mouth, and start breathing short breaths, through your nose
She does
The Bride continues in ; (
) That's a lot better
But you're still too agitated
Can you hear your heart
It's like 'm buried alive with Buddy Rich
Turn off that flashlight
Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself
(
) No
can't turn off the light
Yes you can
The darkness will have a calming effect
Now turn off that fucking light
She does
The screen goes Jet Black - Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave
The old coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the flatbed
Before they climb into the truck and drive away, Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave
'  () - Budd behind the wheel
Ernie in the passenger's seat
Car radio playing Mexican music
Budd's silver cell phone rings
(into phone) Yellow
() - Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the great state of Texas
She calls Budd on the airplane phone
Didja do it
Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we speak
smile spreads across Elle's face
She rests her head back against the seat's headrest
Her eyelids close
She slightly parts her lips
and lets out a; "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" This is the face of satisfaction
: Chapter eight "The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei" -  - We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China
: "      " , tells us a story over this landscape; (
) Once upon a time in China, some believe around the year, one-double knot-three
As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the 70's
Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor   as the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "
" (
; ') head priest of The White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the road, contemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei's infinite power would contemplate -- Which is another way of saying, who knows
When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction
As the monk and the priest crossed paths
Pai Mei -- in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods
The nod, was not returned
Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei
Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture
The motives of the monk, remain, unknown
What is known, were the consequences
The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult
The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable
So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus
And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart Technique
(
) What praytell, is a ten-point palm - exploding heart technique
(
) Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts
He hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure points on your body
And then, he lets you walk away
But once you've taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to the floor dead
We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five shaolin monks
Who after being hit
take five steps
then fall to the floor dead
() - Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through the mountains of China, enroute to  's
Did he teach you that
No
He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique
But he is Nietzsche's psalm personified
If Pai Mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger
Now one of the things always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years
Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise
Whatever -  -  - Pai Mei says, Obey
If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out
And if you throw any American sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you
- The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White Lotus Mountain
For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest
The temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples
But now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more
All the priests have died
All that remains, is a very old man, who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil
neither was wrong
huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill leading to Pei Mei's home
Bill climbs down to the jeep
He'll accept you as his student
Caught him in a good mood, aye
More like a sadistic one
She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back
Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended
Just seeing those steps again makes me ache
You're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker
Why did he accept me
Because he's a very very very old man
And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely
Not that that has any effect on their disposition
But they do learn the value of company
When will  see you again
That's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies
What
Nothing
When he tells me you're done
When do you think that might be
That my dearest, all depends on you
Now remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm
Least not for the first year
You're going to have to let him warm up for you
He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while
Adios
The jeep speeds off down the road
leaving the Bride all alone, somewhere in the middle of China
She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps to Pai Mei
The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred years ago, except now it's empty and dusty
The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin steps
(yelling) Hello
Her Voice  in the cavernous temple
's   back; '  (
) Up the stairs, yankee woman
beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's private chamber
(to herself) More stairs, Jesus Christ
The still unseen Man's voice  back; '  (
) If it is Christ you seek, turn back now
She climbs the wooden staircase
' ' : We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area
The Bride enters the room
She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her head
* From here on end, whenever  is spoken     by The Bride, or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in However, whenever      is supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick
* Teacher,  am unworthy to be your student -- Pai Mei is still unseen
'  * Your Mandarin is lousy
can't understand a single word you say
It causes my ears discomfort
You are not to speak unless spoken to
Do you understand Mandarin any better than you speak it
* speak Japanese very well -- '  * didn't ask    if you speak Japanese, or Mongolian,    for that matter asked if you    understand Mandarin
* little,  am still learning
'  * You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu, not linguistics
If you can't understand me,  will communicate with you like  would a dog
When  yell, when  point, When  beat you with my stick
Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor
He's just like he was in the films earlier
Long White Hair, Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing White Robe
Everything's the same, except he's older, by about a hundred years
He sits stone still in his sitting area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim
* Bill is your master, is he not
* Yes, he is
* Your master tells me you're not entirely unschooled
What training do you possess
* am proficient in a combination of Tiger and Crane style
And  am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai Sword
* (he makes a ) The exquisite art of the samurai sword
Don't make me laugh
Your so called exquisite art, is only fit for Japanese fat heads
You really are a silly ass
This brings up The Bride's eye
She  at the old man
* Impudent dog
You dare glare at me
She lowers her eyes
* 'm sorry master -- * -- Silence
do not wish to hear your unintelligible excuses
Pause
Pai Mei softly  to himself, and strokes his long white beard
* Your anger amuses me
Do you believe you are my match
* No
* Are you aware  kill at will
* Yes
* Is it your wish to die
* No
* Then you must be stupid
Rise stupid, and let me get a better look at your ridiculous face
She rises
The through the scrim, eyes down
Pai Mei laughs to himself again; * You breathe hard
The one hundred steps robbed you of your wind
So your stupidity is matched only by your weakness
Is there anything you do well
-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese
despise the Goddamn Japs
would of thought an American would be immune to their pompous posturing
Apparently  was wrong
Go to that drawer
The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer
She opens the drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged weapon
* Remove the sword
The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword
Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time, parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride
* Let's see how    good you really are
Try and land    a blow
If you land a single blow,    'll bow down and call you master
The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she  with the sword
He deftly moves out of the way
The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film, with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes
Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of Effort and Frustration
While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out of the sword's path
He's amused, and Speaks while they fight; * Come now woman, can't you even hit an old man
She tries more
* Your ability really is quite poor
He  her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood
Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard
* Ha ha ha ha ha
've fought cripples who posed more of a challenge
Now fight, goddamn you
She  with a wild cat's fury
He  and  and  her sword easily
He      , and   on the Blade of her Sword
The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe it
Pai Mei smiles at her and says; * From here you can get an excellent view of my foot
He does a  off the sword, kicking the Bride in the face in mid-somersault sending her The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall
Pai Mei stands waiting for her,    in his hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride
* Give up
Or care to try again
The ' shows determination
Not to win, not even to land a blow, that she knows is impossible
This man's ability is truly amazing
However be that as it may, she's determined not to quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to distinguish herself in his eyes
in some way
She takes the sword from him and tries again
But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young girl harm
Like bringing the blade up against her other arm
Poised to cut it Off
* That blade's sharp
Careful not to cut off your own arm
Then he  her arm, till the blade's against her own throat
Then  again till it's against her hip
Then  again while  her leg, till the blade's edge is against her thigh
* If you can't fight any better than that, what use do you have for a leg
He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him
he calmly  out of the way
Then, he  her in the stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch
* Now that really would be a shame
He takes the sword from her grasp
once
The 's against her jugular
He  twice
The 's against the pocket of her throat
He  a third time
The 's against the nipple of her right breast
* Your swordsmanship is amateur at best
He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the blade
Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on the top of The Bride's head
She lets out a howl, and falls to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin
* 'm a hundred and fifty years old, and you can't even make me break a sweat
He  the sword in half with his hand
* Let's see your Tiger and Crane style match my Eagles's Claw
Again she
again he eludes
Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal style martial arts dance
As she  and he
he yells out; * pathetic
terrible
you idiot, you should've landed that blow
you call that crane
Enough,  grow bored
With little effort on his part, he reaches out and  her wrist,
She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers
He could literally break her arm in half
* asked you to show me what you know, and you did
Not a goddamn thing
He  her wrist
The pain is excruciating
* Like all yankee women, the only thing you know how to do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money
He  more
She
* Excruciating isn't it
asked you a question
Through gritted teeth, she answers; * Yes
* could chop off your arm at will
think  shall
He raises his other hand to chop off her arm
The Bride  in ; No please don't
* If you wish to speak romantic languages, you've come to the wrong place
* Please don't cut my arm off
* It's my arm now
can do with it what  please
If you can stop me, suggest you try
* can't
* Because you're helpless
* Yes
* Have you ever felt this before
* No
* Compared to me you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't you
* Yes
* '
He lets go of her wrist
She cradles her still-throbbing arm
* Is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you were
* Yes
* Can you cook
* Yes
* 'll be the judge of    that
(pause) Draw me a bath
your    training will begin tomorrow
That    arm is still mine
You may lose it    yet
- Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him
His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate, he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall
The Bride stands behind him, watching
He lets out a , and puts his fist
He turns to the new student; * Since your arm now belongs to me, want it strong
Can you do that
* can, but not that close
* Then you can't do it
* can put my hand through that at six inches
* And you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope-sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what  asked
What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then
Curl into a ball
Or do you put your fist through him
He  the wall again leaving another hole
* Now begin
The Bride takes her place in front of the wall
She  it
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her scraped knuckles
Then again
And again
- Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table
Pai Mei concentrates    on eating
The Bride's hand is scraped bloody
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her fingers won't    work
She puts down the sticks and takes a scoop of rice    with her fingers
Pai Mei  her on top of her head with his stick
* If you want to eat like a dog, will make you live and sleep like a dog
Outside
If you want to live and sleep like a human being, pick up those sticks
She does
The Bride  it
She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall, hesitating
Then Pai Mei's behind her
* It's the wood that       should fear your hand, not the other       way around
No wonder you can't do       it, you acquiesce to defeat       before you even begin
He walks off in a huff
- Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride)
* In that pit, is a rat
We see one lone rat in the huge pit
* In the sky, is a bird
Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and up in the sky
to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through it
* You are to go into that pit, and catch that rat, with your bare hands
If you catch the rat,  will deem you the victor, and tonight you will dine on bird
But, if you can't catch the rat by sundown, 'll deem the victor the rat
And because of the disgrace to my student,  will be forced to kill it
And then  will force you, to consume his body
Because to be my student, you must develop a taste for victory
She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes with her rodent opponent, and goes after it
The Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu
wall
At  punching the wall in front of her in her sleep
Trying to catch the rat to no avail
golden arrow kills the rat
She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand, looking down on her
It's sundown
She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase) and looks at her teacher
She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the golden arrow
Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to her teacher
* acknowledge defeat at the paws of this rat
However,  will not eat this filthy vermin
What  will do
(she  the rat open like a pomegranate) is consume his victorious heart
(she snatches the tiny heart from the rodent's carcass
Holding it between her fingers
) But tomorrow, you kill a big bird
She  the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew
Pai Mei looking down on her, says; * How does victory taste
* Bitter
We do a Shaw Brothers  into a  on Pai Mei, he gives an affirmative  and
The ' goes through the wall
(to herself) Wow
'   - Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he hears a noise
* Woman, is that you who disturbs my meditation
She answers from outside the door; '  (
) Yes, teacher
* Enter
She does, bowing to one knee
* What news do you find so worthy, as to disrupt my bath
* did it teacher
put my fist through the wall
and the looking at the hole in the wall
* Very good
Would you care to demonstrate
She moves in front of the wall
Takes her position
Her right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where she'll strike
Like she's transferring her energy into the wood
She removes her left hand
and
She hits it , but her fist doesn't go through
Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no expression
* think you watching is making me nervous
* Not only that, it has you speaking before you were spoken to
Try again
She does
And when she does, she  it
he says in ; Impressive
She immediately goes down to her knees; * Thank you teacher -- He just as immediately, lifts her back up
* You still fight better than you speak
Finally, a woman who understands what's important
He  the wall one inch in front of her
* Begin again
Then the old man leaves to finish his bath
The blonde gal begins again
Fist against wood

: , -- The Flashlight Beam turns on
The  in Profile
Her breathing is normal
We can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box
Her composure is back
Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above her
Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where many nails meet
Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound by a leather belt around her
Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belt's binding
Then, using her bare feet, then her bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to her
When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside down
The   falls out
Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists, till both hands are free
She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin lid
The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose, about three inches from her hand
, she begins to concentrate
Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy to it
Her long, white fingers, ball up into a
and that  begins  the coffin lid above her
With each Strike she lets out a
And
Her   into the wood, leaving  on the lid
And
crack in the lid
Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride
More dirt
Even more dirt
and dirt pours into the coffin like water
Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride -  -  - -  -  - trough the earth like a sprouting plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air
'  - straight out of an Italian horror film
We see the tombstone of " ," and the mound of dirt over her grave
The Bride's hand breaks the surface
then like one of Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother earth's womb
Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she rolls over on her back, exhausted
She drinks in the night's air as if it were gulps of water
is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle on her body
looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt
- Texas diner across the street from the graveyard stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer, when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's big picture window that makes him look twice
' : Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts character "
" With each of her footfalls, a smaller mushroom cloud of dust comes off her
The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says; 'd like a glass of water
: Chapter nine " and " : Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving full out on top of the desert's surface
Spanish Rock coming out of her powerful speakers
'  - The car stops in front of Budd's camper
She shuts off the car and the radio
The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with one Good Eye
Want some breakfast
' '  - Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper
Elle sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet
Budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as he finishes telling the tale of last night
So that's called a Texas funeral
Yep
got to give it to ya Budd, that's a pretty fucked up way to die
What's the name on the grave she's buried under
Paula Schultz
Budd turns on the  blender, as Elle writes down the    name Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her pocket
As the blender  , Elle looks around and    sees the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the In the front room
Budd shuts the blender off
Can  look at the sword
That's my money in that black case, isn't it
Sure is
Well then, it's your sword now
The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair
She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath
So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword
Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars with breakfast margaritas
That's a Hanzo sword alright
Bill tells me you once had one of your own
Pause
Once
How does this one compare to that one
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every sword ever made -- wasn't made by Hattori Hanzo
Here, wrap your lips around this
He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip
He takes a gulp
So, which "" you filled with
What
They say the number one killer of old people is retirement
People got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it
've always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship
So now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which "" are you filled with, Relief or Regret
little bit of both
Bullshit
'm sure you do feel a little bit of both
But  know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other
The question was which one
Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says; Regret
Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol' girl
never saw nobody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill
Bill useta think she was so damn smart
tried to tell him
Bill, she's just smart for a blonde
He looks over at Elle and grins
Elle looks at him
Want your money
She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet
He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open
Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are inside stacks of a hundred thousand each
At the sight of all this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle
Great day in the morning
He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then another
and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks down and sees a    coiled underneath
The Black Mamba opens its
and Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession (three times in the face, and once in the forearm)
Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles of money fall with him
Elle takes a sip of her Margarita
The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator
Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor at her feet
His face    is already grotesquely swollen and white as a sheet
The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system
Oh, 'm sorry Budd, that was rude of me wasn't it
Budd -- 'd like to introduce my friend, The Black Mamba
(gesturing towards the refridgerator) Black Mamba -- this is Budd
You know before  picked up that little fella,  looked him up on the internet
(she removes her notepad from her pocket) Fascinating creature the Black Mamba
Listen to this, (reading from the notepad) "
In Africa, the saying goes, in the bush, an elephant can kill you
leopard can kill you
And a Black Mamba can kill you
But only with the Mamba, and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time, is death sure
Hence its handle; Death Incarnate
" (looking up from the paper) Pretty cool, huh
(back to paper) "
Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons, acting on the nervous system causing paralysis
The venom of a Black Mamba can kill a human in four hours, if say bitten on the ankle or the thumb
However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within twenty minutes
(up from paper to Budd) Now you should listen to this cause this concerns you
(reading from the paper) The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be gargantuan
(looks up from paper) -- You know 've always liked that word Gargantuan, and  so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence
(back to paper) "If not treated quickly with anti venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings
However, the Black Mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite
" Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away
She looks down at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just described
Now in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left, let me answer the question you asked earlier, more thoroughly
When it comes to that bitch,  gotta lotta "'s" in me
Revenge is one
Retribution is another
Rivalry is definitely one
But  got another "" for that bitch you might be surprised to find out
Respect
But right at this moment, the biggest ""  feel, is Regret
Regret that maybe the greatest warrior  have ever met, met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky piece of shit like you
The woman deserved better
Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her cell phone and presses one button
The other party comes on the line, but we never hear their side
(into phone) Bill
Elle
have some tragic news
(pause) Your brother's dead
(pause) 'm sorry baby
Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places her foot over his mouth
(') She put a Black Mamba in his camper
(pause) got her, sweety
(pause) She's dead
(pause) Let me put it this way
If you ever start feeling sentimental, go to Austin, Texas
When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers
Then you take those flowers to Huntington cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone marked "Paula Schultz", then lay them on the grave
Because you will be standing at the final resting place of
The ' '  (the real one), with both her picture and the name,
Yes, that's her real name
of 1st Graders on the first day of class
1st   reads roll call; 1ST Melanie Harrhouse

1ST Beatrix Kiddo
The grown-up , Here
'm so sorry baby
--Look,  can get there in about four hours, should  come over
(pause) No no no no no, you need me baby
'm there
(pause) Okay, 'm leaving now, go smoke some pot or something
'll be there soon
She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man under her shoe
Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money
The out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle
Elle senses it
And slowly turns her head to look back
Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver
's tighter and tighter, till Elle says; Bring it on, bitch
The viper known as death incarnate,  at Elle
Elle flicks her wrist slightly
She doesn't even swing the blade
She just holds it
The snake's head touches it, and is immediately from its body
'  look down at the Japanese steel in her hand
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel
Now that's what  call sharp
'  - Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black suitcase in her hand
She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the engine, turns on the radio
she thinks she hears something
she looks out her driver's side car door window
' : The dirty   behind the wheel of her new, enormous red pickup truck,
The behind the wheel, her jaw drops open
She's gobsmacked
Not only does she see the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal coming at her at 100
The Red Pickup - the Trans Am, the gold and black car through the air, then     about five times in the desert sand and dirt
ending upside down
The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of the black and gold sports car
smile with the slightest hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face
She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper
'  - As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body greets her
As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor from decapitation
She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in particular
We don't have the slightest clue what it could be
The '  - Watching

The searching the camper
Her
The ' : Budd's camper, Budd exits by himself
The searching the camper

The ' : She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a
The searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor, resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath
She removes it from its hiding place
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths
She opens it
It is a Hanzo sword
Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man  Ever Loved, from Bill
" She closes the sheath, this will do
She sees a pair    of cowboy boots
Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot against the sole of her foot
Her feet and this man's    boot are around the same size
She slips her dirty feet in    them
She's good to go
Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck
cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye
The camper door swings open
The Bride emerges from Budd's home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword
Every footfall creating a cloud of dust
The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other in showdown position
shark smile spreads across Elle's face
Bravo, Bea
actually thought that alacky had got the best of you
You thought wrong
The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish
Elle does the same
(referring to the sword) What's that
Budd's Hanzo sword
He said he pawned it
Guess that makes him a liar, don't it
Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde warriors circle each other
(question) Elle
(answer) Bea
was wondering, just 'tween us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye
- of Pai Mei  out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw
called him a bastard
Oooh, not so good
Were  to do it over again, 'd bite my tongue
One more question
Shoot
Where's Bill
Villa Quatro
Gulf of Mexico
Elle nods her head 'yes
' You wouldn't lie to me now
Why lie
Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position
The Bride raises up her sword
saw what you did to that little Mamba in there
Want to try that on somebody your own size
intend to
The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai bearing
Oh    Elle,       should warn   you    before we get started
Hattori Hanzo swords are extremely sharp
They can    take   a    little   getting    used   to
Careful not to cut your own arm off
don't rattle, bitch
The Bride brings her sword back into combat position
You're gonna bleed though, you're gonna bleed a lot
The two blonde warriors
swords in position
no longer circle each other
but instead move forward
closer and closer to each other
one baby step at a time

Their  moving closer

It looks like a scalpel cut
No blood
Just skin separating

Neither woman bleeds

The Blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a   , like that of an aerosol can, we even  the slight
Elle feels nothing
She turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a balloon
She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray, it's immediately
Elle drops the Bride's sword
As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each other
The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes
And now looking across at each other, the two women see the other for the first time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as bitches
but as sisters
Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up
She falls to her knees in front of The Bride
then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body
Her blood runs down The Bride's leg
As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg
The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires
Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have been theirs
The Bride standing, Elle on her knees, the desert surrounds them

The Bride has finished burying Elle
She sticks a jerry rigged wood cross in the ground as a marker
Then using her sog; carves the name "

Then drives away in the big red pickup

As he heads out the patio, he tells her; Oh and Josephina, take the remaining flowers and spread them around the house, if you would
Yes, Mr
Bill
He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back in
You know  just had a great idea
Take the roses, and spread the petals on the bed  just got for her

Different teachers teach you different things
But one thing learned from all three, was "in combat, the opponent that does the unexpected, can usually expect to be the victor

Not from me
And least any of you judge me a bushwhacker, remember
It was Bill who taught me how to shoot

He sees something ahead

It's a long long long way off, but it will get closer every second
Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a glance at his sleeping child
His cell phone , he answers it
Hola
'  () - The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first time in five years and six months
Hello Bill
Kiddo, is that really you
Oh, it's me all right

My pussy wagon died on me
Who's your little friend
He glances down at the sleeping child
Oh, you mean the little tow head next to me, who looks extraordinarily like you
Yeah, that one
Her name is
The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice
Yes
Do you approve
She wipes her eyes
Her hand moves under her shirt, fingertips rest on scar
Yes
Can she hear us
Not now, she's in dream land
How old is she
What do you mean by that
How many years has she been alive
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if she's five
Is she five
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you supposed to automatically know
did and  do
(pause) want to meet her
Have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight
She's expecting you
What do you mean
knew you were on your way, so told
Her mommy was coming to see her
(confused) What have you told her about me
That you were sick, that you were asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since  was born, how will she know what  look like
" To which  replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you
" And she said, "Then 'm gonna start dreaming of her
" So  gave her a picture of you -- -- which one
The one  took of you in Paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand
Since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed
The     The Bride's face, then You know, prettier photos of me do exist
And she's seen them
But the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread
(pause) We normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient
Yes
Pause
The cars get closer
When do we cross swords
Well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes with its very own private beach
And my private beach, just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight
And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight
So, swordfighter, if you want to sword fight, that's where suggest
But if you wanna be old school about it - then we can wait till dawn, and slice each other up at sunrise, like a couple real life honest to goodness samurais
As per usual Kiddo, 'll leave the big decisions up to you
The cars will soon pass
Do me a courtesy
Anything
Slow down as we pass
want another look at her
Wear something nice tonight

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does the same
The cars in   start to pass
The Bride looks into the other car
We  past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat
We go      till the car moves past us, to Bill holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our face
He
It emits only a tiny
The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the driver's side window  over her head
The two cars pass each other
The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat
She looks in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away
Grabbing the cell phone she screams in it; You fucking maricone
Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview
Now you just wait one second there little missy
Unless 'm confused, we are trying to kill each other aren't we
Now  wasn't planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt, but, she is asleep
And if you're gonna forget everything ever taught you, and gawk like you ain't got good sense, 'm gonna take a shot, am  not
Did she wake up
Of course not
She's like you that way
look forward to this evening
It was great speaking with you, Bea

She's dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one she was bushwhacked in
Over her  we       talking to her earlier on the phone
() Half of Bill's strength, lies in his talent for the unexpected
If you intend to vanquish this man, and claim your daughter, you must not only expect the unexpected
You must do the unexpected
to The Bride
We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his front door
We see  -   approach her
Now comes the new stuff
She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the boot, and removes her
The two satellites freeze
She    once, and

She    a second time
buys the farm
She slides the  again
and  the front door, kicking it open and stepping inside
'  - -  hurries down the stairs, reaching for his weapon
She  the shotgun into his kneecap
He  down the stairs landing at her feet
She points the shotgun straight down at his face
Hello Manny
She
Then moves further into the house
Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head for parts unknown
So far, so good
She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook and housekeeper, Josephina
Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her
Hello Josephina
Hello Miss Beatrix
She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen pantry
Stay in here and don't come out
If you leave this room 'll shoot you, comprende
Yes
She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway leading to the living room
With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she moves down the hall
As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to her from around the corner
'  (
) Kiddo
If you're through shooting the servants, 'm in the living room
You remember how to get to the living room, don'tcha
Go down to the end of the hall, and make a left
Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end
She pumps the slide, and    -   - The '  - blink once
comes off the trigger
What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo, holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her
Standing next to him is five-year-old little
, dressed    up in a very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange squirt gun, aimed at The Bride
The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says; (loudly) Bang Bang
Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been shot
Oh
, Mommy got us
lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside her dad
Bill falls to the floor
Oh, 'm dying
'm dying
parrots this
Oh, 'm dying
'm dying
Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl; Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot you
The little girl falls down pretend dead
The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them, is truly thrown
Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying breath; You did it Quick Draw Kiddo
You are-the fastest
And with these last words, pretends to die
But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic narrator's voice
But
little did Quick Draw Kiddo know,
that five-year-old
Gunn was only playing possum, due to the fact she was impervious to bullets
raises her head off the floor and says; (to Mommy) 'm impervious to bullets, Mommy
(to
) Hey, get back down there, you're playing possum
The little girl's head drops back down
Bill continues his dramatic narration; So, as the smirking killer approached, what she thought, was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when the little
Gunn fired
springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says; Bang bang
The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery
Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his normal voice; Mommy, you're dead - so die
The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death scene fo her little girl
Oh,
, you got me
should have known, you are the best
She falls to the floor and pretends to die
The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy
Mommy opens her eyes
Don't die Mommy,  was just playing
From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her for the first time
know baby
They embrace each other
waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy
Did you dream of me -  dreamed of you
The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins to creep into her voice; Every single night, baby
She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better look at her
Now let me look at you
My my my
What a pretty girl you are
You're pretty too, Mommy
starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair
Thank you
All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor
When  showed you Mommy's picture, tell Mommy what you said
The little girl gets shy
'mon shy girl, you know what you said, tell Mommy, it'll make her fell good
As she strokes her long blonde hair, little
says; said -  said - You're the most beautiful woman  ever saw in the whole white world
That's the truth
That's what she said
points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the Bride's wedding gown
What's that
Oh, Mommy spilled something on her dress
Blood
No
Kool-Aid
Do you like Kool-Aid
No
Do you not like it, or do you not know what it is
Parroting Bill; do not know what it is
Well, it's a very tasty beverage that  used to drink, when  was a little girl
It comes in a lot of different flavors and colors, and it's really good
Maybe we should fix some sometime
Want to do that
The little girl gives a big nod, yes
Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating,  think it's dinner time don't you
does an exaggerated nod, yes
(to Mommy) When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya
No
(wiping imaginary sweat off his brow) Whew, then dinner should be done
(shouting to the other room) Josephina
You can come out now, we're ready for dinner
(
) Yes, Mr
Bill
He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet
Then says to
; Want to go on top of the world
She says excitedly; Yeah
He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through the house towards the dinner table, Bill and
Sing The Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World
" It's obviously one of their songs
- The dining room of Bill's house
The family, mother father and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating
, don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world
Yes  do
In fact it's better than pretty
What's better than pretty
Gorgeous
Very good, gorgeous
Mommy is gorgeous
The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill
You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy
Why
Where you a bad daddy
'm afraid  was
was a real bad daddy
(to Mommy) Our little girl learned about life and death the other day
(to
) You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio
killed him
didn't mean to, but stepped on him and he stopped moving
Emilio was her goldfish
She came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead
" And  said, "Really, that's so sad
How did he die
" And what did you say
stepped on him
Actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, " accidentally stepped on him
" Right
Yeah
To which  queried, "And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl
" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him
(beat) Hummmmmm, the plot thickens
And just how did Emilio get on the carpet
And Mommy, you would have been real proud of her, because she didn't lie
She said she took Emilio out of his bowl, and put him on the carpet
And what was Emilio doing on the carpet, baby
He was -- flapping
And then you stomped on him
Uh-huh
And when you lifted your foot up, what was Emilio doing then
Nothing
He stopped flapping, didn't he
Uh-huh
And you knew what that meant, didn't you
Uh-huh
What did that mean
He was dead
(to Mommy) She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead
Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death
fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet
So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant
Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him
So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better
And  asked her, why did she step on Emilio
And she said, she didn't know
But knew why
You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right
Uh-huh
And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is you kill him
And you discovered that, didn't you
Uh-huh
So we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea
And right now 'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven
But the point being, our child learned two very important lessons
One, about life and death
The other, somethings once you do, they can't be undone
knew just how she felt (to
) You loved Emilio, didn't you
Uh-huh
Well sweety,  love Mommy, but did to Mommy what you did to Emilio
You stomped on Mommy
Worse
(making his finger a gun) shot Mommy
Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing
shot her for real
Why
don't know
Did you want to see what would happen
No,    knew what   would happen to Mommy   if  shot   her
What  didn't know,   is when    shot Mommy, what would   happen to   me
What happened
was very sad
And that was when learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone
What happened to Mommy
Why don't you ask Mommy
Are you okay Mommy
Does it hurt
No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore
Did it make you sick
It put me to sleep
That's why haven't been with you
, 've been asleep
But you're awake now, right
'm wide awake, pretty girl
- Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine
The steps lead to the beach and the sea
Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps across from him
Between them the dawn sky breaks
Did she go to sleep easy
It took her a little bit
She was excited
She's quite the little chatterbox
Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello
But if she likes you, you can't shut her up
She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards
He holds up the bottle of vino
Red wine
She shakes her blonde head, no
'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya
She gives him a look
(pointing towards the beach) We're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we
She shakes her blonde head, yes
Well, 've already had    a glass
So unless you want to win    by an unfair advantage, you should    have a glass of wine
So we're both    on the same footing wine wise
She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red
You know, there's an old man down here, his name is Esteban Viharo
He was a pimp
knew him when was a child
He was a friend of my mother's
told him about you
When  showed him your picture he smiles and said; (imitating his accent) "Yesss,  see the attraction
" He told me a story about taking me to the movies when  was five
It was a movie which had Lana Turner in it
And whenever she would appear on screen, he said  would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount
And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes
Who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father
Well not you, that's for damn sure
She gives him another look
Must we have to endure your little zingers
No we mustn't
But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future,  will resist the temptation
Baby, you don't have a future
Bill drinks some wine
sent you to
and you never came back
thought you'd been killed
Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead
mourned you
Then in the third month of my mourning, track you down
wasn't trying to track you down,  was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who  thought killed you
And when find you, what to  find
Not only are you not dead, you're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you're pregnant
How do you expect me to react
Why do you think  hid
Why did you leave in the first place
You have cold eyes towards me now
understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time  saw them, or was that just my imagination
No
The Bride decides to tell all
As she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen
To give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in Japanese; () You sent me to
to kill that lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong
Bill interrupts her
() You are you talking in Japanese
The Bride explodes; () What the hell do you care what talk in
Don't you know when to keep your mouth shut
'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking
Now may  continue
You're right, 'm wrong, continue
The morning  left,  threw up don't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, threw up
When  got to my hotel, threw up
So naturally  started thinking, maybe  might be pregnant
So  bought one of those home pregnancy kits
Went back to my room and took the test
The little strip said blue
was going to have a baby
tried to call you, but you weren't there, so just thought 'd call back later
But you never did
- Would you shut up, 'm trying to tell you how  feel
My apologies, please continue
So  just figured 'd call you back later
was just so happy,  put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip
What  didn't know, was at some leg of my journey,  was spotted
With me in Los Angeles it didn't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her
So she sent an assassin of her own to kill me in my hotel room
As  was dancing in euphoria, the killer came down the hall
There's a knock on the hotel room door
The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole
:  pretty   in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager
She's holding a basket of flowers
The Bride says through the door; Hello, can  help you
Hello, 'm Karen Kim, 'm the hospitality manager of the hotel have a welcome gift from the management
Seeing it through the peephole
Oh, it's beautiful
But 'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later
As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she bends down to pick it up
in the door, right where the bent over woman was previously standing
Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand
The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her
Karen aims the shotgun down at her
With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door
It    Karen in the face
The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover
Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and the shotgun The Bride's way
The Bride  out of the way
The   the side of the room it
The Bride comes up from the floor with her  in her hand, and   across the room at Karen
Karen  the thrown knife with her shotgun
The blade sticking in the weapon's wooden stock
She removes the knife, and drops it to the floor
The Bride is a sitting duck
There's nothing she can do except wait to get shot
So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh
Well that's my sister, bitch
'm Karen Wong, and 've come here to kill you
She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride
Wait a second
Karen stops
Yes, 'm an assassin
Yes  did come here to kill your sister
But 'm not gonna do that now
Oh,  know you're not -- - listen to me
just found out, right now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, 'm pregnant
Karen looks at her, "what
"
On that table is the    home pregnancy kit
On the floor by    the door is the strip that says    'm pregnant
'm telling you the    truth,  don't want to and  won't    kill your sister
just want    to go home
What is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook
Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right
But this time you're a hundred percent wrong
'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now 'm scared shitless for my baby
Please, you hafta believe me
Look at the strip, it's on the floor
Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the floor
Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head
The Bride complies
Karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor
Then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box
Blue means pregnant
'll read it myself, thank you
It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her
Okay, say  were to believe you, what then
Just go home
'll do the same
Karen does
She starts backing out of the room
before she leaves, she says; You fucked with the Wong sisters
Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment  have ever experienced
And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei
Before that strip turned blue,  was a woman,  was your woman
was a killer, who killed for you
Before that strip turned blue,  would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train for you
But once that strip turned blue,  could no longer do any of those things
Not anymore
Because now  was a mother mother who only had one thought on her mind
Please don't harm my baby
Can you understand that
Yes
But why tell me now, and not then
You wouldn't have let me go
Specially once you found out  was pregnant
You would've tried to talk me out of it
It would have been a big scene
just said fuck it
Starting to get mad
Fuck who
Bill, you couldn't know  was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and  didn't want that
That's not your decision to make
Yes, but it's the right decision
And  made it for my daughter
Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate
But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be
Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves
She would be born with blood stains
had to choose chose her
She takes a sip of wine
It's morning now
And now it's her turn
You know five years ago, if  had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen
You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list
(beat) 'd've been wrong, wouldn't
Bill listens stoney, then; 'm sorry was that a question
Of impossible things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong
The Bride listens stoney, then; Well
Well what
Explain yourself
already have
When  told you the story of when  thought you were dead
Didn't you get how badly felt
You call that an explanation
Well if that's too cryptic let's get literal
(beat) There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard
You experienced some of them
That's his explanation
She hears it
They both understand one another
You and  have unfinished business
Baby, you ain't kidding
They both laugh
You know how proud  am of you, don't you
Yes
You know  was rooting for you, don't you
figured
You know on that beach out there want you to be the victor
She nods her head, yes
You also know you're going to have to defeat me
can't just give it to you, even though  want to
It won't be necessary for you to give me anything
've surpassed you
'll take it
Well, as they say in Missouri, show me
- As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach, The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket off, face each other in a combat stance
The Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in its sheath
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to use
This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation
He removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with
The two combatants
quite far from each other
they intend to charge/attack
stand in showdown stance
The The
She takes her combat stance
But what she doesn't do is remove her sword from its wood sheath
The fist of her left hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center
Her right empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in Japanese; () Attack me
She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for his attack
He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat grip, to charge her
(to himself) That's my girl
He screams a samurai scream
and charges her
She stands motionless
Unblinking
Watching him coming
No fear
No expression
We go back and forth, close, wide, low
They meet
Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at her side
sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier
his sword and her sheath lock together
they're close to each other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers, and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm
His body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack
he coughs up a little blood
he looks at her
Their faces are very close
The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with compassion
He taught you the ten point palm exploding heart technique
Of course he did
Why didn't you tell me
She doesn't have an answer
She looks at him apologetically; don't know
Because
'm a
bad person
He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips; No
You're not a bad person
You're a terrific person
You're my favorite person
But every once in awhile
you can be a real cunt
They smile at each other
Then
Bill turns his back to her
And walks five steps in the opposite direction
with each step his heart swells, on the fifth
It
, like of a tire blowout
He falls to the beach
dead
The Bride walks over to his body
She unsheaths her Hanzo sword
Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth
She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges
She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's blood from off the blade onto the white cloth
She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body
The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this purpose, has come to the end of its journey
Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself, one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father of her child,
her
The tear is for her as well
For she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other man's
The Hanzo  slowly sliding into the wood sheath
the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek
The blade disappears inside the sheath
The teardrop falls of her chin
Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished business, is completed
The Bride exits the beach
Bill doesn't
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack
We see the Bride, get
The Bride and
are driving away
The Bride and
eating in a coffee shop
The Bride and
in a motel room
They both wear bath towels and both of their blonde heads are wet
The Bride sits behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head
The Bride spooning
from behind, both of them are asleep
It's the morning
Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning cartoons on
- The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying her eyes out
She shoves a towel in her mouth so
won't hear her
We wonder for a moment what's wrong
Till we see her face in
Her tears are tears of joy
She can't believe this is even happening
Her daughter is alive
They're together
They get to begin again
She covers her mouth so
won't hear her crying and get worried or confused
But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes, happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought
Over and over again
Thank you god
thank you god
thank you god
thank you god
She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby, hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning cartoons
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to each other, watching
The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right in the jungle
