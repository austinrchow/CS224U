We   east past Inglewood  the orange grid of
at night when suddenly we     the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening

747 -  -                            2 The usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece
As the plane to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings
3                                                 3 mid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip
He sits by the window
His relief on landing is subtle, but we
Suddenly, he hears -- ' You don't like flying, do you
McClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him
Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear
No, no, where'd you get that idea
(smiling) Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel
After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks
Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes
Fists with your toes
Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes
mean like this
work out that time zone tension
(demonstrating) Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag
know it sounds crazy
Trust me
've been doing it for nine years
The plane stops
Passengers rise, start to take down overhead luggage
McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the businessman  seeing: 3-
- '                    3- Peeking out from his jacket
3-                                                 3- Recognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly
It's okay
(showing badge) 'm a cop
(pause) Trust me
've been doing it for eleven
The businessman relaxes, moves off
McClane now wrestles down the biggest Teddy Bear  Schwartz had to offer
Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat and an overnighter
Barely managing all this, he turns, : 3-                                           3- She bumps noses with the bear, gives a look
(smiling, about the bear) Maybe you should have bought her a ticket
Her
He scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs
She doesn't complain
(eying him) Neither would
McClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is
moves down the aisle

( ) -      4 bottle of Dom Perignon as the cork explodes across a large office floor decorated for Christmas
Japanese man, mid-fifties standing on a desk holds up the bottle triumphantly and looks out at an adoring audience of junior executives and office personnel
He is  , Sr
of Sales for Nakatomi, a multinational corporation
Ladies and gentlemen

Well-dressed, with stylish, slicked-back hair, he looks and acts very smooth
What about dinner
() Harry, it's Christmas Eve
Families
Stockings

Rudolph and Frosty
those things ring a bell
She turns into: 5                                                     5 Her name is   , though the nameplate on her door stops after the first two
She puts the printout down on her secretary's desk
(in reply) was thinking more of roaring fireplaces
mulled wine and a nice brie
Holly ignores the come-on, turns to her secretary
Ginny, it's 6:40, you're making me feel like Ebeneezer Scrooge
Go on, join the party, have some champagne
Ginny slowly manipulates herself out of her seat
She is enormously pregnant
(grateful) Thanks Ms
Gennaro
(worried) Do you think the baby can handle a little sip
(eyeing her) Ginny, that baby's ready to tend bar
(not giving up) How about tomorrow night
Holly just points to the door
He follows Ginny out, clearly not giving up
Just then the party on Holly's phone picks up and we: : 6

An Xmas tree is in the b

McClane residence
Lucy McClane speaking
Holly suddenly smiles
It is the first time we've seen her smile and it speaks volumes about the person hidden under a tough business exterior
(with affection) Hello, Lucy McClane
This is your mother
She looks up and watches Ellis leave
He "shoots" her with a "catch ya later" wink
Mommy
When are you coming home
Soon
You'll be in bed when  get there, though
Will you come say 'good night'
Don't  always, you goose
(enjoying Lucy's giggle) Now put Paulina on the line, and no searching the house for presents
(caught) didn't look in the front closet under the steps
Is Daddy coming home with you
,
(hearing this, jumping up and down) Yeah
Daddy
Daddy
Daddy
(on second thought) And a Captain Power
(a little tightly) Well, we'll see what Santa and Mommy can do
Goose, put Paulina on, okay
Lucy hands the phone to a young Salvadorian woman, , the housekeeper
Hello, Mrs
Holly
You coming home soon
'm working on it
(beat) Did Mr
McClane call
* No ma'am
Holly hides a trace of disappointment
Well
maybe there wasn't time before               * the flight
You should probably make up the spare room just in case
(smiling) Yes, Mrs
Holly
do that already
* Holly's smile comes through again

-                                      7 McClane, wearing his wool topcoat and carrying the biggest stuffed animal  Schwartz had in stock and his hangup bag, comes down the American Airlines ramp and into the terminal
He avoids one near-collision involving his stuffed animal, an act which drives him into another fender bender with a who looks like she's ready for high tide at Zuma
As she smiles, weaves onward, McClane looks at his own Arctic gear and then the girl as she kisses a similarly garbed boyfriend
(sotto, to himself) California
He looks around the terminal at: 7-
-                                   7- are going on all around his as grandparents greet grown children and their children,   greet uniformed , our Babbit businessman greets a pleasant wife and two pleasant kids
It's all very traditional, very touching and not the least bit corny
7-                                                 7- McClane watches, moved by the sight, then looks around the waiting area, just on the chance his family might be waiting
Instead he spots a thin, gangling black kid, , in an ill-fitting chauffeur's uniform
As he waits he beats out a rhythmn on a "Nakatomi Corporation" card with
McCLANE written on it in magic marker
McClane pauses in front of him, unsure
'm John McClane
(introducing himself) Argyle
'm your limo driver
Hey, nice bag
He turns and starts walking
McClane paces him, still juggling bag and giant animal
Argyle
Don't you take this stuff
(stops) Do
'm sorry
You're gonna have to help me, man
This is my first time driving a limo
That's okay
This is my first time riding in one
: 8          -                                    8 from the Lincoln emblem on the car
Both Argyle and McClane are in the front seat
Just kick back and relax, man
We got everything you need:  , , , , telephone, full bar
He looks in the back seat, which is occupied by the bear
If your friend is hot to trot know a couple of mama bears
(turning to McClane) Or is he married
Married
McClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell
He scowls at Argyle
The girl was off today
Hey, didn't expect you to sit up front
(back to the topic) So, your lady live out here
The past six months
(thinking about that) Meanwhile, you still live in New York
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle
Hey, 'm sorry
When  was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie,  forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me
(amused) It's okay, it's okay
(instantly) So, you divorced of what
McClane gives up
She had a good job, it turned into a great career
But meant her moving here
Closer to Japan
You're fast
So, why didn't you come
'Cause 'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and  got six months backlog of New York scumbags 'm still trying to put behind bars
don't just get up and move
(to the point) You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack
McClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct
Like  said, Argyle
you're fast
(popping in a cassette) Mind if  play some tunes
hard   blasts from the speakers
How 'bout some Christmas music
That is Christmas music
And damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run  doing a revisionist number on   or something
McClane gives up, looks out the window
9
9 Convertibles with Christmas trees in their back seats, Time/Temperature signs which reads:  69 degrees, palm trees trimmed in Christmas lights, intermittent West side token "Happy Chanukahs"
it is clear that Christmas
style has its own unique style
10-                                                     10- 11                                                            11 11-      -                                 11- one of the stars of this film, the well-lit, impressive and spanking-new
The limo pulls up, parks, and Argyle gets out
McClane lets himself out, which is fine because Argyle doesn't remember he's supposed to do it
They both go to the rear of the vehicle
12
-                         12 Argyle climbs out of the limo and stops by the trunk
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms
Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it
It's corny, but  could live with it
What is it don't work out that way
Where you gonna stay
'll find someplace
He looks up at the highrise lit by huge spotlights, then back at Argyle who's made no attempt to open the trunk
Tell you what
'll pull into the parking garage and wait
You score with your wife give me a call on the car phone and 'll leave your bags inside at the desk
You strike out
'll get you to a hotel
He hands McClane a business card with the number on it
(taking the number) You're all right, Argyle
Just remember that when you sign for the tip
(pointing to the building) They're paying for it, so don't be shy
McClane grins, heads inside
13
-                            13 Beautiful and -- on first glance -- deserted
Finally a in the sterile lobby reveals the presence of a hidden until now behind a massive desk
McClane goes there, signs in
Holly McClane
The Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console
Just type it in there
McClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen
He gives the Guard a look
the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try
13-     -                                        13- McClane types, "McClane, Holly"
Pause
The screen replies, 13-                                                   13- Frowns
thinks
Simultaneously inspired and suspicious, he types again
13-                                                 13- McClane types, ,
This time the screen , shows an elevation of the building and then a floor plan of the 30th floor with Holly's office
* 13-                                               13- Cute toy
Yeah
When you have to take a leak it'll help you find your zipper
Thirtieth floor
* (pointing) Take the express elevator and get off at the noise
McClane nods, moves off
He moves to the elevators, and as he does his experienced eye takes in: 13-                                       13- Patrolling a different area
13-     -                       13- which are cleverly worked into the decor of the lobby
13-                                                13- McClane reacts with bored professionalism,  to the guard
Lots of hardware
The guard shrugs
McClane gets in the elevator
14
-                                   14 McClane hits "30" and  to the hyper-powered  with which he rises
He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks
As he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous , McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party
As the doors open the noise us
15      30TH  -                                       15 McClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward
He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips
scowls
Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass
Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party
People he doesn't know throw streamers over him
kisses him
He grins
kisses him
(to himself, shaking his head) California
Finally he queries a
The  drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction
McClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings
He sees: 15-                                                     15- who has an air of authority
McClane goes up to him
Excuse me, 'm looking for -- Holly Gennero
Yeah
How'd you know
've spent half my life on airplanes,               * can recognize someone who just got off one
(shaking hands) 'm Joe Takagi, Mr
McClane
have something to do with this company
So 've heard
Takagi smiles, leads the way
As they approach Holly's office door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- "Gennero"
Holly went to the Vault room to some documents
she should be back any
16      '                                          16 Ellis is behind the desk
He's  and just as they come in he  the back of the slick desktop with his hand
Both McClane and Takagi catch on
but Takagi tries to hide his awareness
Ah
hi
just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone
(as Ellis rises) Ellis, this is John McClane
(with meaning) Holly's policeman
(to McClane) Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions
(shaking hands with Ellis) That explains the recent deal with Bolivia
Ellis , runs a checking finger under his nose
(sotto) Relax, Ellis
'm off duty
(eager to change the subject, to McClane) Can  get you anything
Food
Cake
Watered down champagne punch
(grinning) 'm fine
(looking through the glass) You throw quite a party
didn't know they had Christmas in Japan
Hey, we're flexible
Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks
McClane laughs
He likes this guy
Actually, it's kind of a double celebration
* We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly
The door
Holly comes inside
All set, Joe
The contracts went over the wire, and -- (surprised) John
16-                                            16- moment
Does the sound of the party stop for him
We know it
For her
It's more cryptic
We sure hope so
(recovering) was hoping you made that flight
(quietly) was hoping you were hoping that
She laughs, kisses him on the cheek
Ellis notes the awkwardness
(to McClane) You wife's made for this business
She know how to drive a hard bargain
Yeah
remember our first date
Show him the watch
As she hesitates: Go on, show him
What're you, embarrassed
(to McClane) little token of our appreciation for all her work
He takes Holly's wrist, holds it up
McClane smoothly takes the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync
think it's me
(to Holly, pointedly) Is there a place  can wash up
(happy for the excuse) Sure
Follow me
They go out
Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his disapproval of certain snow at Christmas
: 17
-                                   17 An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground parking garage of Nakatomi
18
18 It goes down the ramp and passes Argyle's black limo
The driver's seat is
19
-                                        19 Argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by the tinted rear windows
He is making a drink from the bar with the  on and his rap music blasting from the cassette player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him
20
-                              20 The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down
As the truck idles, the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard
21
'  -                              21 McClane's
He is clenching and unclenching his toes
(surprised, actually feeling tension decline) Son-of-a-bitch
It works
Holly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc
Begin to wash up in the private bath
What are you doing
It's a long story
You know, think that Ellis has his eye on you
That's okay
(pause) have an eye on his private bathroom
McClane's face shows his relief (or rather, his attempt not to show any)
So, where are you staying
This                    * all happened so fast  didn't even ask you on the phone
McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago
He said could bunk with him
Oh
Where does he live
Ramona
no, Pomona, that's it
Pomona
You'll be in the car the whole time
Look, let's make this easy
have a spare bedroom
It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house
McClane fixes her with a look
They would, huh
(beat; honest) would too
They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other
Just then a man and a woman, both a little tipsy, open the door to the office, see that it's occupied and beat a hasty retreat
The interruption temporarily dents the mood
Holly tries to smile
But for McClane it's the last frustration
've missed you
* Especially my name
You must miss it every time you write a check
When did you start calling yourself 'Ms
Gennero'
(caught) This is a Japanese company, you know
They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door
Sure
It's unnerving
remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash
mean, talk about your wind chill factor
Didn't we have this same conversation in July
Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here --  had to take it -- No matter what it did to our marriage --
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be
Oh, here it comes
One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations
' never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions -- You want to know my idea of a marriage
It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down
and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad
(quietly) needed that, John
(pause) deserved that
There's a clumsy pause as if she's almost challenging him to say
something but he sets his jaw, says nothing
Just then the door opens and Ginny leans inside
Miz Gennero
Mr
Takagi is looking for you
he wants you to say something to the troops
Thanks, Ginny
'll be a second
Oh, this is -- (mock bright 'radio' voice) Hi
John Gennero here
'm the sensitive and supportive man of the eighties
Ginny looks puzzled, goes out
Holly sighs, moves to the door
'll be a few minutes
Wait here -- Don't  always
She's gone
Immediately, he slaps his forehead, contrite
(to himself) Schmuck
22-                                                      22- 23                                                             23 24
-                          24 The Guard at the front desk notices the Emory truck on his monitor
The Guard continues to watch the Emory truck and only half notices as a Mercedes pulls up in front of the building and two extremely well-dressed  (late twenties) climb out and start up the stairs for the door
As they cross the lobby to the Guard's table to sign in, we hear their conversation
#1 () (animatedly) So, Kareem rebounds -- listen, this is a great play -- feeds Worthy on the break, over to
, to Magic, back to Worthy in the lane and -- Suddenly the other man pulls out a Walther pistol with a silencer and aims it at the Guard's forehead
Before the Guard can react he pulls the trigger
(dryly) Boom
two points
(The speed with which the murder takes place sets the tone for the rest of the action
)  The killer moves behind the desk, stepping over a small pool of blood from the Guard
His name is , big, with long blond hair like a rock drummer
Karl takes off the silencer and looks at the video monitor of the Emory truck
The first man, Theo, opens his briefcase, takes out a portable  radio and speaks into it
We're in
25                                                  25 the driver nods at the security camera as several men climb out of the rear of the van and begin unloading wooden crates by the service elevator
26
'  -                              26 McClane looks at all the lavishness around him and picks up a phone by the toilet
He opens his wallet and takes out the phone number Argyle have him
photo of his children stops him
It's of Holly, the two children and himself in happier days: Six months ago, before Nakatomi came calling to Holly's door
McClane flips it over
On the back in crude but painstaking hand of a five-year-old it says:    , (and in more primitive letters)
McClane returns the photo to his wallet, dials the number
26
26 Theo enters the small control room and comfortably sits behind a maintenance keyboard
Whistling a vaguely familiar tune, he in some commands and locks down the passenger elevators up to the 30th floor
Then with several more computer commands, systematically causes: 27                    27 28                          28 29                                                       29 30        -                                     30 Theo finishes typing and disconnects the keyboard and pulls out the wires from beneath the panel
31
-                                       31 The doors to a service elevator open    , impeccably dressed, lean and handsome, he steps out into the lobby like he owns the building -- and in a way he does
Theo steps to the door of the control room and tosses Hans a Hans goes to the front door, waves the card over a magnetic plate
An   and the door  with a
Hans looks out at the street
Appropriately enough, "not a creature is stirring
"  Century City is quiet
32-                                                      32- 35                                                             35 35-     -                                       35- An elevator opens    , all armed with Kalashnikov machine guns are carrying canvas kit bags
One of them, , a rugged American in his twenties, goes to the dead guard and immediately begins changing into his cloths
Meanwhile: )  Karl takes a tool case from the elevator and joins his brother , first playfully grabbing him
They head for the basement stairwell; )  Theo leaves the control room and nods to Hans
)  Eddie finished adjusting buttons and snaps on his pilfered uniform, takes his position behind the front desk
36                                                         36 looks at his watch and seems pleased
He steps into the service elevator with the others and presses the button for the 30th floor
The entire sequence has taken maybe sixty seconds

'  - 30th  -                37 McClane is still barefoot, his pant legs now rolled up above his ankles
He stretches his toes again
Damn, it works
He lights up a new Marlboro, dials a number on the (bathroom) phone
38
-                      38 large sign says:
Inside Tony stands in front of an intimidating matrix of phone lines -- but what he has in mind won't require a doctorate in Electrical Engineering
Karl comes over, gives his an elder brother's punch on the arm, points out what to do
Together they focus on four  plastic conduits which run out of the main panel over their heads
Tony nods
Opens a case  a compact electric chainsaw

40 Argyle is reclining on the seat
The music is on so loud that it is nearly impossible to hear
Hey, John, what's the word on you and your lady
' The vote's not in yet
41
-                                  41 Karl cuts through the four tubes one at a time

'  -                             42 McClane on the phone
' (mocking) 'Vote's not in yet
'  What's that supposed to mean
What do you want, 'All My Children'
We're making progress
After  get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then  can -- He stops and gently taps the phone cradle
No dial tone
43
43 Argyle looks at the phone
What
Mr
Mac, you there
He turns down the music but there is on one on the line
(to himself) Well, call me back, John
You got the number
He hangs up and turns the volume back up
44      '                                          44 McClane hangs up the original phone and then tries the other one on the desk
It, too, is dead
45
45 Hans and the others approaching the 30th floor
As they grow closer, we hear the noise of the speakers growing louder and louder
The men cock their weapons and brace themselves as the car stops and the elevator doors open : : 46
'                                      46 McClane grabs his shoulder harness off the back of the chair, moves quickly to the doorway
He looks down the hall
47      '
47 Two terrorists,  and , armed with -5 machine guns searching the offices on the hall one by one
They open a door, look in from the hallway, and move on quickly to the next
They are four offices away and moving fast
McClane looks across the corridor and sees the stairwell door -- too far to reach without being seen
48                                                      48 steps back, throws off the safety on his Beretta and braces himself
He opens the door, peers through a crack at: 49       -                                49 as McClane's eyes  their weapons
he's totally outgunned, and he knows it
Franco and Fritz reach the office just before Ellis' and throw open the door  the man and woman who interrupted Holly and McClane a few minutes before, now in the throes of passionate lovemaking on the desk
The two terrorists smile at each other, then enter the office
moment later the man, (trying desperately to pull up his pants) and the woman (buttoning her blouse) are pushed out into the hall and toward the larger group by Fritz
The other terrorist, Franco, goes to Ellis' office and opens the door
It is
empty

-                                   50 McClane's bare feet padding quickly up the concrete stairs, two at a time
We  him up, then out onto the: 50-    31th                                              50- This is the mezzanine floor immediately above the main Nakatomi lobby
McClane sees Theo and  wheeling carts of equipment
McClane ducks back into the stairwell, he runs up another flight and out onto: 51                                              51 Eventually it will be one large secretarial pool, but only a portion is completed
Half-finished partitions and office furniture in its original plastic wrappings are everywhere
One end has a few lonely finished working areas
McClane moves quickly to a desk and picks up a phone
It's out
Shit
He looks out the window at: 51-      - '
51- high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles with lights
McClane stares at a   in her bedroom
She's wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret catalog
As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials a call on her high-tech phone
It seems so easy
51-                                                51- Frustrated, he watches this, knits his brow
Think

30th  ( ) -                  52 The employees have been herded to the center of the room where the desks have been pulled back
Many people are whimpering
52-                                                      52- She looks around the room for McClane
She's so intent on this that she doesn't see one  waving her forward
Exasperated, he  her
Her glare at him shows us her mettle
52-                                                      52- As the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly
He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage
He pats her hand "reassuringly
" Hans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group
He reaches into a pocket
several people
but what he comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook
He checks his own scribblings like a dais speaker
(soothing, in control) Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of greed around the globe, it is about to be taught a lesson on real power
You
will be witnesses
If our demands are not met, however -- (sad smile) -- You may become participants instead
(beat, checking notes) Now, where is
'Takagi'
Where is the man who
(slight smile) used to be in charge here
Takagi is shoved forward
He's worried but far from cowed
Hans steps towards him
Extends a hand
(quite civil) Mr
Takagi
How do you do
My name is Hans Gruber
Takagi is confused by his charm
Hans waves politely in the direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the executive away
to show Holly, concerned

- 33rd  -                      56 McClane pauses outside the stairwell door to the 33rd floor, he presses the handle and cracks the door open   a computer floor
The computer machinery drones on under the lights behind plate glass windows
McClane quietly closes the door and moves to another floor

33 computers

Riding silently
Hans alone seems relaxed
He whistles
We recognize it as a snatch of Wagner
Nice suit
John Philips

Takagi stares at him, speechless
(smiles) have two myself
(beat, as he exits:) 'm told Arafat shops there too

60 McClane starts to open the stairwell door to the Machine Floor when a  above him gets his attention
He moves silently up one flight to the roof
Quietly, he cracks the door and looks out onto a Machine Floor on the lower level of the roof
61      '
61 Three terrorist, ,  and , are unpacking the wooden crates we saw in the garage from the service elevator
It's not clear what they're doing but it seems very military like and ominously defensive
Heinrich  up to the ceiling and says something in German
The others nod
Heinrich starts to turn towards the  and: 62                                                      62 closes the door and slips back down the stairs

-    -         63 Hands enters, looks around
* * And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept
For there were no more worlds to conquer
(to Takagi) The benefits of a classical education
Hans admired a scale model of a bridge
Behind him are       * photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed
Karl and Tony listen
Takagi watches
It's beautiful
always enjoyed models as a boy
The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail
perfection
(defensively) This is what this is about
Out building project in Indonesia
Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region
not 'exploit' it
Hans straightens, looks hard at Takagi
believe you
(smiling) read the article in Forbes
* Takagi looks confused
Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console
Mr
Takagi, we could discuss industrialization of men's fashions all day, but 'm afraid my associate, Mr
Theo, has some questions for you
Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions actually
: 64          :                          64 _ _ _ _
65                                                        65 sits fingers poised over the keyboard
Hans sits opposite
Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has just read the screen, blurts: don't have that code
(beat; to Hans) You broke in here to access out computer
Any information you could get -- they wake up in Tokyo in the morning, they'll change it
You won't be able to blackmail our executives or threaten -- Hans barks him to silence: Takagi complies
Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet
Mr
Takagi
'm not interested in your computer
(beat) 'm interested in the 640 million dollars in negotiable bearer bonds you have in you vault
Takagi's reaction
Yes
know about them
The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault
You want
money
What kind of terrorists are you
(amused) Who said we were terrorists
65-     -                            65- He tiptoes along, gun held ready
He can  the  of voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it
65-      -                               65- Hans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer
He feels his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it back into his coat pocket
(weighing the gun) The code key, please
It's useless to you
There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them
You'll never get it open
Hans lifts the gun
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us
(aside to Karl) told you
It's not over
Hans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster, turns back to Takagi
This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr
Takagi
'm going to count to three
There will not be a four
Give me the code
He cocks the gun: don't know it
get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman
'm telling you
You're just going to have to kill me -- Okay
He pulls the trigger: 66          -                            66      * reacts as if shot
A66-
A66-    * The glass doors to the boardroom are splattered red and dripping
66-                                                    66- Takagi is still seated, but the chair in flat on its back, blood flowing out into the carpet
Hans springs to his feet: We do it the hard way
Tony, see if you can dispose of that
(the body) Karl, you'd better check Heinrich's work up on the machine floor
Karl, in the midst of handing Theo a fifty dollar bill, nods
67       -                                      67 stunned, sees Hans move and tries to retreat
But his gun bumps the underside of the table: 68       -                                          68 hears it
Karl is the first to move: 69                                                        69 springs through the door, finds nothing
He checks two adjoining rooms, the first is deserted
The second
is locked
70                                                        70 returns to Hans
Nothing
(nods) See to Heinrich
(to Theo) Now
you can break the code key
(grins) You didn't bring me along for my charming personality
As he heads for the elevator
(under his breath) 'Though you could have
Hans smiles, confident in his team, and follows the door that Karl found locked
71          -                     71 slowly lets out a breath, praying softly: Argyle
Tell me you heard the shot
Tell me you heard the shot and you're calling the police right now
: 72
-                              72 Argyle is on the car phone
The music is playing
'm working, honey
Working hard
'Course 'll be by later to pick you up, have  ever lies to you
My boss
He thinks 'm cruising to Palm Springs
72-      -                         72- Heinrich  something into a niche here, scrambles like a monkey to a new position
Helped by one of his men, he down, moves to another area, climbs up again, removing something from his shoulder bag
73        - 31ST                                73 Hans and Theo enter the safe room
The huge corporate safe looms in front of them
Theo places three kit bags onto a table and rolls up his sleeves
He swivels a computer console into handy reach, sits down
How long
Thirty minutes to break the code
Two hours for the five mechanicals
The seventh lock
that's out of my hands
If out plan works
the  will get rid of it for us
Theo grins, begins typing
73-                                                 73- He types begin going by:  ; 11111; ; 11112
74      32ND                                             74 McClane moves out onto the 31st floor, angry at himself
Why the fuck didn't you stop him
(beat) Because, you ignorant sonofabitch, you'd be dead, too
Think
think, Goddamnit
Suddenly he looks up at the ceiling and sees a sprinkler head
His look drops to the wall and focuses on a small red fire alarm switch by the door
75
-
-            75 An  sounds
Quickly firemen move to their machines as a voice of a 911  drones
911 Main Wilshire units
Two alarm fire at Nakatomi Plaza -- The voice continues as the station doors open and we: : 76
-     -    76 fire alarm indicator light showing which floor has sounded the fire alarm -- suddenly begins flashing, emitting short, loud beeps
Eddie, the terrorist in the guard's uniform and manning the station, immediately picks up his
77      32ND  -                                      77 McClane stands at windows looking Northward for fire trucks
Suddenly we  the flashing red lights of   in traffic two miles away
'mon, baby
come to Papa
'm gonna kiss your Goddamn dalmatian
78
-   -                 78 He rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony
(calmly, to Eddie on ) Call 911, give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm
then disable the system
(looks across at Tony, presses talk button again) Eddie
What floor did the alarm go off
78-                                              78- They've heard the alarm here, too
Heinrich, Marco and       * Uli  the alarm and continue their mysterious work
79        -                                79 McClane stands silhouetted against the window
In the distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto Avenue of the Stars
Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the second
McClane watches in disbelief
The trucks slow and turn down separate side streets, heading for home
(realizing) Son of a bitch
Just then the elevator bell rings and we  the figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine gun drawn
We     the elevator area until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire floor
McClane is gone
80                                                   80 under a desk
He takes in his options
81
81 The feet of Tony
They move slowly in his direction
McClane Looks down the aisle next to the windows
It leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past Tony
82                                                        82 He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane
The fire has been called off, my friend
No one is coming to help you
You might as well come out and join the others
(fingers the trigger of his machine gun) promise not to hurt you
Moving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space
It is empty
As the       he listens and hears another -- a  coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles
Tony heads toward the noise
Sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one
The sound is just around the partition
He tenses, then spins into the cubicle
83      '
83 radial arm saw spins noisily
84                                                        84 grins at his nervousness
He moves to turn it off, not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane, steps   behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel against Tony's temple
Freeze, Police
don't move or name your beneficiary
Tony doesn't
McClane cocks his Beretta
Tony watches him calmly
You won't hurt me
Yeah
Why not
(smug) Because you are a policeman
There are rules for policemen
Yeah
My Captain keeps telling me the same thing
McClane suddenly   Tony across the head
Tony , then swallows, worried for the first time
Let's go
Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane , but the big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall
Tony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk
He locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that sends Tony reeling into the hall
McClane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions
They careen across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash into: 85                                            85 then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below
For a moment, both men lie still
McClane, still holding onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly to the side
For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man
Then, slowly, methodically, he begins to
He turns all his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on it
He expertly examines the machine gun when a coming from somewhere attracts his attention
He rises, moves cautiously to the source
85-                                                  85- It's Tony's , which has fallen from the dead man's waist during the struggle
McClane stares at it, formulating a plan
: 86
32ND  -                                86 Tony's now shoeless feet  McClane, who sits on the floor near the body hurriedly lacing up the dead terrorist's boots on his own feet
He ties the last lace and tries to take a couple of steps
He winces in pain, goes off balance
Quickly he starts taking the boots off
million terrorists in the world and  kill the one with feet smaller than my sister
He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage
Then he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretary's chair
He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to: 86-                                                     86- Where he scribbles a note we cannot read on a piece of paper
Then his eyes fall on some Xmas decorations nearby
He smiles to himself
86-       -                      86- McClane's back as he pushes Tony's body on swivel chair into the elevator
(:     ' ) as McClane pushes the buttons for the 31th and 30th floors
We notice he's got the dead man's machine gun and that a wooden desk ruler protrudes from McClane's back pocket
The elevator doors close and the car starts down
After it's dropped only half a floor, McClane forces the doors open with his fingers -- stopping the car between floors
Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors, then opens the outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor, then up onto the roof of the car
Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the edge and removes the ruler, closing the inside doors and setting the car in motion again
86-                                              86- The hostages have been gathered together in a group in the center of the open floor, guards flanking them
The elevators are barely visible from the edge of the group, which is where Ginny and Holly are sitting
Ginny winces, uncomfortable on the floor
Holly soothes her
Hans stands in front of them like a stern camp counselor in front of the assembled bunk
wanted this to be professional, efficient, adult, cooperative
Not a lot to ask
Alas, your Mr
Takagi did not see it that way
(harder) So he won't be joining us for the rest of his life
(as that sinks in) We are prepared to go any way you make us
When we have achieved our aims you can walk out of here
or be carried out
Decide now, each of you
But remember that we have planned everything to the last detail
We are completely in change

, gun held ready
His jaw drop as he sees: 87-    '  -
87- Still and dead, flopped in a swivel chair, a red Santa hat gaily placed on his head
87-                                                      87- (indicating the hostages) Get them over there
Schnell
The guards quickly hustle the hostages away as Hans crosses to the elevator, but for before
87-                                                     87- Sees the body

He sees a folded piece of paper in Tony's collar, takes it out
87-     -                                       87- It reads, "Now  have a machine gun
--
" 87-                                               87- Perhaps a security guard we overlooked
Hans lifts Tony's chin again, lets the head flop over
(thoughtfully) Security guard
They're usually tired and burned out old policemen growing           * fat on a pension
This is
something else
87-       -                            87- McClane is staring through a tiny crack at the scene below him
from Fritz in the b

to Hans and France just below
McClane is  in his weather-beaten cop's notebook
The first notation is   :   + 30 -- odd
Then it says,
As we watch, he adds "3
1 87-    in Lobby (
) and 2+ with hostages
Plus ones on     87- roof (3)
" ' (slightly spooked) We have to do something, Hans
' (not pleased) Yes
we have to tell Karl his brother is dead
Tell him to come down
Now McClane writes "=

Franco, you and Fritz take the body upstairs and out of sight
don't want the hostages to think too much

-   -   -     88 On top of the car, listening to the conversation below
Franco and Fritz step into the car and the doors on the elevator close
The car accelerates upward and McClane grabs onto the heavy, grease-coated cables to keep his balance
Already his clothes are soiled; his face and feet, arms and hair are dark from the dirt and sweat
The car speeds up the shaft -- passing the car bringing Karl down to the hostage floor -- and stops at the machine floor
The doors open and McClane hears them roll the chair with the body off the car
McClane looks up

90                                                     90 pulls himself up onto it
As he moves along the catwalk looking for a way out, he passes an unmarked metal door, 2'x3'
McClane pushes it open and looks in

He stops, switches to a nickel

He moves cautiously around a corner and we  a metal ladder leading up to a door marked
Opening the door McClane enters a darkened: 93                                                    93 damp and full of pipes and goes to another door
He cracks the door and looks out

Open and deserted
Only a heliport above him is higher

But this is not productive -- (pushing him away) He was my only brother

We search

He starts to move
Hans stops him
(firmly) No
Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators

Ellis slides over to Holly

Takagi

-                                      96 McClane climbs to the heliport and leans against the leeward side of a wall surrounding it
Shielded from wind, he pulls out the , turns to channel nine, and starts broadcasting
Mayday, Mayday

She plugs in her headset

No one kills him but me
It's an order and the look he gives the other two backs it up
Karl checks his magazine,  it into his rifle as the elevator opens to the roof

102 McClane moves around the roof, circling the helipad, making sure he has a good enough view to avoid being ambushed
He can't see in all directions at once but he's doing the best he can
They've already killed one hostage, and they're fortifying their positions while we're bullshitting
Now, send police backup
' Sir, 've already told you, this is a reserved channel

Suddenly machine gun shells rip into the concrete wall in front of him
The noise is deadening as we: : 103

Tracer bullets rip into the wall behind him
He reaches the corner and sees the other two terrorists moving toward him
Before they see him, he leaps down to the next level out of range of Karl
106
-                         106 The Dispatcher looks critically at the Supervisor in the sudden silence

Another teenage employee behind the counter also smothers a laugh
The customer is , young for a police veteran, old for the rest of the world
Thought you guys just ate donuts
They're for my wife
She's pregnant
If  knew she was gonna eat a dozen at a shot,  woulda bought stock in the company
The Clerk nods and puts them in a bag
As Powell pays, suddenly his   crackles to life
' / Dispatch to One Adam Ten, over
Powell grabs the radio, speaks into it
One Adam Ten, go ahead
' / Investigate a code two at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City
(thinking) Nakatomi Plaza
He moves to the door, steps outside
107-
107- Powell looks towards the horizon and up
There it is, Nakatomi, in all its gleaming glory
One Adam Ten, do you copy
Powell is already moving to the car
He tosses in the twinkies, hops behind the wheel
(into police radio) Roger, dispatch
'm on the way
And he   leaving the store: : 108
-   -                         108 running for his life, from Fritz and Franco, doesn't realize he is being herded around the building toward Karl
Suddenly McClane turns a corner and sees Karl
The big man fires a burst and McClane ducks back stopping at the exterior door to the pump room he used before
It is locked from the inside
He  the lock off with a burst from his machine gun and slips into the darkness of the: 109                                  109 Coming quickly out of the pump room, McClane picks his way over the same ground as a few minutes before and opens the door to the elevator shaft
The dimly lit shaft yawns before him
He starts down the ladder back to the catwalk, moves along it --
The catwalk ends, and the elevator is gone
109-
-                              109- Karl crosses, starts to open the door to the elevator shaft when suddenly their radio crackles with -- ' Karl
Franco
Did you catch him
No, but he's in the elevator shaft
' Prefect
The elevators are locked off
* He can't escape
Just shut him in and return to base
Hans, he killed by brother -- (more firmly) Karl,  know you want him, but the police are probably on their way
Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots
If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it
Karl
Karl
Karl turns off his radio
In the light of their flashlights, the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief
He opens the door to the elevator shaft
109-
-                        109- He's  enough of this to realize he's in deep shit
He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette lighter
110-                                                    110- 117                                                           117 117-     ( )                        117- Karl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held    * ready
118                                                    118 Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at his narrow confines, and then at: 118-                                                118- and its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides
118-                                              118- Quickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling
Then, he  the weapon across the outside opening of the air shaft door and lowers himself into the: 119                                                   119 meanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent over it like a kid doing a half-asses skin-the-cat on a swing set
His feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they reach the top of the air duct, then  in the open space
He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch the bottom edge of the duct
Suddenly he  something  above him and looks up
120                                            120 It was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa
The few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips
When they're gone
he will be too
121                                                       121 He moves silently toward the corner
122      - '                                 122 now only inches from the bottom edge
McClane's arms are fully extended now
He hears Karl on the metal catwalk
His muscles strain and quiver
123                                                   123 One of the canvas end slips through the clip
124                                                  124 He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing
Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside the door
125                                                     125 Around the corner Karl , unsure of the sound: 126                                                  126 holding onto the ledge by his hands
With every ounce of strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct, clawing for a hold
127                                                     127 He rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath the doorway
He moves to the small door, shines his light and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire
128
128 The shaft is deserted
Moving his light around he sees the air duct
Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump room door
129
-   -         129 He lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space
He awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and thumbs it
The flickering  shows him this ain't no place for claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow corridor full of weird shadows
The far end (if there even if one
) is
Whew
for a moment there  was worried
He turns out his lighter, and starts crawling
130-                                                    130- 133                                                           133- 133-
133- The three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door
Karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms
The others checks these while Karl approaches the , trigger finger
Almost immediately, the others return
(a whisper) Nothing
Karl looks puzzled
Then he thinks, mentally retracing McClane's few options
Karl's eyes scan the architecture here, and then suddenly he looks
133-                                                   133-   * 134
134     * The ceiling is criss-crossed with air ducts
He fires a      * burst into the ducts
135
-                                   135 McClane remains motionless in the air duct
Three quarter-size holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to nailing him
Sweat covers his face, drips silently onto the aluminum
136                                                136 Karl listens patiently for sound
Just then the two other terrorists return
Nothing
Karl hesitates a moment, fighting his instincts before finally turning to go
Suddenly the duct McClane is in  slightly under his weight
Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of aluminum duct work, trying to single out the source of the sound
He steps back into the room and raises his rifle
Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly of McClane's air duct, feeling for weight -- the weight of a body
137                                           137 McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the aluminum fifteen feet away
There is a pause and another three feet closer
He can hear Karl's footsteps on the concrete -- moving slowly below the duct
138                                                     138 His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct
He presses the barrel up again
Still nothing
139                                                  139 Silently he moves his hand, slowly draws his Beretta
The next indention presses up six feet away
McClane points his gun downward and waits
140                                                       140 stops directly below him
The barrel starts up and just touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the door and calls: Karl
Police
Come on
Karl hesitates then lowers his gun and leaves
141      -                                        141 He hears the door close and lowers his head
141-
33RD  -                             141- The large   in the front of the safe  and letters creep by:
We  a

Now his computer screen reads,  #1
Theo puts goggles on his eyes, holds out his hands towards Kristoff like a doctor requesting a scalpel
Kristoff gives him a
You bet your ass 'm gonna proceed
He turns on the drill: 142                                                     142 143
-     -        143 The street is empty, quiet
lone police black-and-white pulls out of the shadows of a side street and begins a slow cruise toward the Nakatomi building
144                                                   144 Driving, alone
He starts up at the tower
It seems calm, its glowing lights matching the warmth of the holiday decorations on the streets
Powell slows to a stop and scans the premises
In the lobby we  Eddie, sitting behind the desk
Powell reports to his radio
Guard inside
No signs of disturbance 'm going up for a closer look
He pulls in and parks in the front
145
-                               145 McClane punches out a ceiling vent and drops down into the machine room
For a moment he stands, listening for sounds of movement
The floor is quiet
He goes to the stairwell
146
-                                       146 The edge of the roof
Suddenly a tall terrorist, James, moves along the wall and looks over at Powell's car
147
3RD  -                                  147 The elevator doors open on Karl, Franco and Fritz
They      * step out onto the darkened floor
We  large number "3" painted on the doors of this floor
They move quickly toward the windows on the Avenue of the Stars side where a terrorist, , with a  rifle has set up a machine gun nest under a half-opened window
Directly below him we  Powell's car
Alexander  the police car with his weapon, finger on the trigger
This is clearly a man hungry for action
148     30TH  (' ) -                       148 Hans watches from above
He raises his
(his usual calm) Eddie
149
-                                      149 Eddie picks up his
He watches Powell coming up the stairs
(to ) Had a feeling you'd be calling
' Let him in
Eddie is a little startled, but he moves quickly
149-                                                149- also hears this, and his eager expression fades
But orders are orders
150
-                     150 Powell tries the front doors
Locked
Eddie comes hustling across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card
Evening, officer
What's up
Powell steps in and looks around
Bland   filters from Speakers here
(  )                           * We got an emergency call that there was a problem here
151
34TH  -   -                    151     * McClane makes his way to the Avenue of the Stars side of the building, enters the board room where Takagi was shot
McClane goes to the windows and looks down at the street
152
152 Powell's car
All right
McClane waits, expectant
Five seconds
Ten seconds
But no commotion, no shouting
He frowns
Where's the fucking cavalry
152-
-                                  152- Powell walks casually across the slick floor, eyes panning the area
Eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his monitor screens
We already had that false alarm, you ask me, the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase
They been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it
(to the screen) Oh, shit, come on,  got fifty bucks on you assholes --
Powell's face shows us he's starting to think he's wasting his time
152--                                                  152- 153                                                           153 153-                                              153- The silent tension is driving him crazy
Come on, come on
who's in that car, Stevie Wonder
He makes up his mind
He lifts one of the big chairs and swings it at the window
The tempered glass whitens on the first blow
153-
153- James sees the glass whiten below him and shouts into his mike
153-
153- Heinrich hears the radio and shouts to Marco who grabs his machine gun and runs
154
154 Eddie watches confidently as Powell moves through the lobby looking for signs of trouble
154-                               154- Uli is there, gun held ready
* 155       - 34th                               155 McClane draws the chair back for the final hit when a terrorist () appears at the door
Both men react, but Marco already has his gun up
He  a round at McClane
The bullets rip into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind the table
156-                                                   156- 156-                                                        156- 157
34th  -                           157 Marco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table, but finds no one
He looks around frantically than squats beneath the table and sees: 158                                                   158 lying prone, his pistol trained on him
Drop it or you're a rugstain
159                                          159 Just then Heinrich, the terrorist steps into the doorway, sees the situation
Marco, duck
Marco dives sideways, but Heinrich still isn't quick enough
McClane   and Heinrich  sprawling in the hallway, machine gun   until he hits the floor
159-                                             159- They can   the gunshots
Holly pales: 159-                                                 159- All Powell can hear here is "  ,
"  He just a yard from seeing the armed terrorist, turns back
Screw this
He turns back
159-                                             159- Marco springs on top of the huge table
McClane rolls on his back so he can cover either angle but it is clear that Marco is in the more enviable position
160                                                    160 on the table top slams in a fresh magazine and smiles
Next time -- don't hesitate
He leans his machine gun over the edge
161                                                    161 aims directly above him and fires twice into the underside of the table
The bullets rip through the table and Marco, who  beside McClane

Eddie moves to lock up after him
Sorry to water your time
Merry Christmas
Powell goes out

34TH    -                      164 McClane rolls out from under the table, goes to the windows, and looks down in time to see Powell heading for the car
Oh, man, please, no -- Desperate, he leans on the glass
which  again, on the verge of going
McClane thinks
looks over his shoulder at the body of Marco
165
'   -                        165 Powell check in on his radio
Unconsciously he begins to the Muzak he overheard in the lobby
One Adam Ten to 6421
We had a wild goose chase on that 436
Everything's okay here
Over
(waiting, loosening his tie, he murmurs) 'Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the
the uh, dum, de dum's delightful
' ' Roger, One Adam Ten
We thought it was a crank call anyway
Clear to code eight
Roger
(putting the car into gear) '
let is snow, let it snow, let it snow -- ' Suddenly Marco's body  onto the hood of his car
(terrified) -- Jesus
Christ
(grabbing for his radio) 6421, this is One Adam Ten -- Suddenly a barrage of    from Alexander on the third floor drowns out his call
Powell ducks and flattens against the seat as bullets blow out the front window, covering him in glass
' Roger, One Adam Ten, please repeat
But Powell accelerates in reverse away from the building, keeping his head low and praying he doesn't hit anything as the bullets follow him, digging into asphalt
half block away his car runs off the pavement and down a , finally to a jarring  in a parking lot which is destined to become police
a few pages from now
Powell sits up and clutches the mike
One Adam Ten, under automatic rifle fire at Nakatomi
Requesting immediate backup and  assistance

34TH  -                            166     * McClane looks down at Powell and grins
Welcome to the party, pal

He covers the mouthpiece, because he's become aware of what's coming from the scanner

Officer pinned down by automatic weapon fire at Nakatomi, Century City -- request assistant -- () ' (intermixed with all this) -- guys, you want to cut through the red tape
They practically turned this car into Swiss cheese --

He drops the phone, pick up another
Shouts -- Mary, this is Dick

Powell sees them, waves them back, points to the third floor
168
-   -                   168 He leans back and closes his eyes, luxuriating in the sound of
He looks at Holly
never through 'd love to hear that sound

(in mid-speech) -- all of you, stay at your posts
We knew that police action was inevitable
(an odd smile) In fact, it's necessary
So let them start their feeble efforts; until them, stay calm
We have the hostages, remember
We are still in charge
Suddenly Hans'  crackles to life
(picking it up) told all of you
want radio silence until further -- : 169-    - 34th  -                      169-    * He's got a  on the table and , and his cop's notebook is out again
He's already upgraded the
to "12 (
) minus 3 = 9" and added other information
As he speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped, their sidearms, etc
Gee, 'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message
You shoulda put it on the bulletin board
Anyway, thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that  waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy
So  invited some of the guys from my card game
In the office, the terrorists , startled, as McClane name-drops
* How
how does he know so much about -- (waving for silence) Ah, how nice of you to call assume you are our mysterious party crasher
You are most troublesome for a
security guard
170
34th  -   -               170      * Moving down the corridor
Now armed with Marco's machine gun and carrying Heinrich's kit bag, he seems more lethal
* (into ) Sorry, Hans, wrong guess
Would you like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change
He rolls Heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of Gauloise's in the man's pocket
He takes them, pats the      * dead man's face
(sotto, to the body) Bad for your health anyway
Who are you, then
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans
The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass - McClane  in mid-speech
He's just opened the kit bag Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died
Now McClane takes out the contents
dozens and dozens of marked "" and a  of cello-wrapped the size of an electric razor
He  in surprise to himself
In the office, Hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns to Karl
* Check on all the others
don't use the radio
See if he's lying about Marco  and find out if anyone                  * else is missing
* He moves
Hans goes back onto the
Meanwhile, McClane   * at the tell-tale  as Hans goes off and on
He knows what's happening
Now, he starts to walk down a corridor, eyes   elevator to the stairwell doors
Mr
Mystery Guest
Are you still there
wouldn't think of leaving, Hans
Unless you want to open the front door
'm afraid not
But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you
(scornfully) Just another American who saw too many movies as a child
Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne
Rambo
Marshal Dillion
Actually,  was always partial to Roy Rogers
really dug those sequined shirts
(harsh) Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr
Cowboy
blinks on the elevator
(long pause) Yipee-yi-yea
mother-fucker
McClane goes quietly through the stairwell door and is gone by the time the search party steps onto this floor
Hans sits quietly
thinking

The other man is Heinrich, and  found his body upstairs

He had the detonators

How is your schedule
Theo moves to his computer screen which shows a schematic of the safe and blinking icons and the words  #2 and #2
Three down, four to go -- Then don't waste time talking to me
Suddenly all  to a nearby  transmitter which broadcasts
' This is Sergeant Al Powell of the Los Angeles Police Department
If the person who radioed for help on this channel can hear me, acknowledge this transmission

33RD  -   -                   172     * (to ) read you, Powell
You the guy in the car

173 Powell stands in front of his destroyed cruiser and looks up at the building
Behind him technicians, City Power and Light personnel,  officers in protective gear, etc
, arrive from all directions
trailer is being backed into a parking lot, which will become the police center of operations
It is like watching a small town being constructed right before your eyes
(to ) What's left of him
Can you identify yourself
: 173-                                              173- Listening intently
Maybe later
Just listen fast because this is a party line and the neighbors are trigger happy
Now here's the skinny:  There's thirty or so hostages on the 30th floor, with probably 2 or 3 guards to cover a group that size
The leader here is named Hans, and besides the pea shooter he ventilated your car with,                            * they got machine guns and                            * sidearms up the yin yang
On top of that one of 'em had a big enough chunck of plastic explosive to orbit Kate Smith
* :  The following dialogue is said  McClane's
We have to find him and shut him up
He's telling them everything -- (shaking his head, calming) The police are irrelevant
We've                    * waiting for the
Until they                     * arrive, we can't finish out work
Meanwhile, let this fool waste time for the police
Fritz, go help Uli                  * find the bag
The    him We must find those detonators
They leave
173-                                              173- ' How many are there
(thinking about it) Figuring there's at least one to cover the lobby, a couple with the hostages
'd say they came in with about a dozen
but they're down to nine now, including the skydiver you already met
These guys are mostly Europeans, judging by their clothing labels, and they're well financed and very slick
How do you know
've seen enough phoney 's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune
Add all that up and  don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay
We notice that everything McClane has said about "clothing" and 's and police jargon, etc
, has set off a little buzzer in Powell's brain
hear you
(on a hunch) Partner
And 's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em
'm ahead of you
partner
Uh, what do  call you

McClane smiles
What the hell
'Roy'
Got it
'Roy'
Now listen
If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay
In the meantime  want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job
Understand
(to ) They're all yours, Al
Good luck
McClane turns off his  and sits against the wall

Stocky, his hair a little too perfect, the very fact that he is the Deputy Chief of Police Operations on a Christmas Eve gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order
His name is
and he moves brusquely past police technicians and goes to the forward group of officers
Who's talking to them
Powell turns around am, Sir
Sergeant Al Powell
Dwayne Robinson
Well, what have you learned
What do they want
The terrorists
Don't know, Sir
We haven't heard a peep from them
(puzzled) Then who the hell have you been talking too
We don't exactly know, Sir
He won't give us him name
He appears to be the man who called in the report
he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others
(exasperated) He claims
Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain
Or some kind of nut case who -- don't think so, Sir
In fact
think he's a cop
Maybe not , but definitely a badge
How do you know
hunch
Things he said
Like, knowing how to recognize a phony -- (exasperated) -- recognizing phony 's
Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know
Something draws Robinson's attention
He looks at: 178

Richard Thornburg gets out, starts supervising the            * positioning of cameras

179                                               179 Hans examines building plans at Holly's desk
Behind him the  is , the sound muted
cops triumph over oafish bad guys
Hans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly
have a request
Oh
What idiot put you in charge
(evenly) You did
(on his look) You murdered by Boss
Now
(waving towards the hostages) They're looking to me
Personally 'd pass on the jab
don't enjoy being this close to you
Hans is impressed by her candor
And she's easy enough on the eyes
Go on
We have a pregnant woman out there -- (on his look) -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good
'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa
No
But 'll have a sofa brought out to you
Good enough
Good enough
And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom
(nods) Yes, you're right
It will be done
He nods to one of his men, and she is waved to the door: As she goes: Mr
Takagi chose his people well, Mrs
Gennero
Miss Gennero
He nods, thoughtful
She goes out
Hans suddenly notices: 180      -                                           180 slide " " has appeared
This changes to a of the Nakatomi building with "" supered over it

This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to you live from Century City

We're  Argyle in the back seat of the limo
(reaching for the remote) What else is new
The    and we  the Nakatomi Building rise up in the b

behind Thornburg
(stunned) Holy shit
We're told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits
Argyle is already bailing out of the car

(on ) Since all the telephone lines have been cut, the only contact with the building had been through the use of communicators which the terrorists brought with them
Strangely enough, so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police
but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to indicate
Argyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front seat and turns on the

Men and vehicles
The  of weapons and breeches
Footsteps running in unison
Powell picks up on this, turns to Robinson, who is standing with the  Captain,
What's going on
What's it look like
We're going in
(flabbergasted) Going in
are you out of your mind
There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know -- -- all we know
We don't know shit, Powell
If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom
If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands
All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio
What about the body that fell out of the window --
Who the hell knows
Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement
Chief, we're ready
'm coming

(over radio) Yo
Begin your reconnoiter

He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost

Robinson looks at him warningly, shakes his head
'm here, Roy, but 'm, uh, kind of busy
Let's talk later, okay
Al, what's wrong
Did something -- (realizing) -- Oh, God
You're coming in
That's it, isn't it
Christ, Powell,  told you what you're dealing with here -- said we'll talk later, Roy
If you're what  think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up
and when to pray
Hating himself, Powell , watches  snaps on in the parking lot to illuminate the area
Also hating himself, McClane does the same thing
Pale, he moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be brutal
188-    '  -                               188- He hunches over his communicator
They'll be coming
Get ready

Eddie waves his card at the sensor and a crashes into place
They hold their weapons behind it, ready

Screen after screen pinpoints all the police activity outside, down to the last detail

Suddenly we  that tune he's been whistling
It's "Singin' In The Rain

193                                     193 Mitchell and Robinson watch from behind the cover of a police car as the  officers remove a portable welding torch and begin cutting their way through the locks

33RD  -                              194 He moves painfully to the window and looks out
He can't see a thing because of the lights
(to himself) No
195
-         195 Suddenly rifle fire sounds from the building
(worriedly) They're shooting at them (calmly) It's panic fire
they can't see anything
(under breath) They're shooting at the lights
More shots ring out from the building going over the officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head
The glow fades
moment later the next light twenty feet away dies
They're going after the lights
The two  officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear
Call them back
No, they're almost in
Suddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the men become sitting ducks

As the car starts down, they remove an anti-tank gun from one of the crates

At the window, they prepare the weapon for use
Outside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the sheltered side of the vehicle
Alexander quickly sights on the armored car

Hans, you motherfucker, you've made your point
Let them pull back

McClane slumps to the floor below the window
He feels helpless, then notices his kit bag

On the police radio channel we  the screams of men inside

We've got one dead
Everybody's hit
Rodriguiz's bleeding bad

That's an order
Hang on, we'll get you out

33RD  -               208 - Like a football
It sits on the seat of a secretary's chair with castors
We     McClane press three detonators into the top, then cover the explosive with a typewriter, tying it securely in place with electrical cords
209         -                    209 wheels the chair to the service elevator, opens the door and block them with a fire axe
He looks in -- the top of the car can just be seen thirty-five floors below

3RD                                         210 James hands the shell to Alexander, who expertly loads it into the anti-tank gun

Geronimo
motherfuckers
For a long moment there is nothing, then:  the shaft is filled with light, then  -- an ungodly  -- and McClane is thrown back across the elevator corridor against the other back of doors by the concussion wave
212       3RD                                       212 The explosion, like a firestorm, rips across the floor: 213                     213 214                                          214 215      , , ,          215 216
216 The police take cover behind their cars
Powell, Robinson, and Mitchell look like they've seen the face of God as the building rocks from the blast
Henry's cigarette falls from his mouth as a desk is sent hurtling across Avenue of the Stars into the trees across the street

Oh, Jesus

Yep
Thornburg looks at his competitors still setting up

Only Hans is relatively calm
They're using artillery on us --
You idiot, it's not the police
(pause) It's him

(on ) Safe and sound, thanks to you
What the fuck was that
The plastique  found
(worried) Is the building on fire
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors
(looking off, nodding) One spotters say you got two with that blast
Two
Are you sure
Before Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him
Is that him
Yessir
(reaching for Powell's ) Give me that
(angrily at McClane) Now, listen to me, mister,  don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'
There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass -- Glass, my ass
Who the fuck is this
This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne
Robinson, and 'm in charge of this situation
McClane leans tiredly against the elevator door
Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne
haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein
Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass
Listen asshole --
(exploding) Asshole
'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national , Dwayne
Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem
Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on
McClane is so furious, he's out of breath

33RD  -                           227 still seething
There is a long pause on the , then: ' Hello, Roy
How're you feeling
(pissed) Pretty fucking unappreciated

So hang in there, man
Hang in there

We're in the studio set
(as the picture stabilizes) of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber
of Hans appears behind her
At the same time, the We realize we're on   , and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his "guests"
He smiles modestly as they "recognize" him from the on air shot, returns to the office
(on ) member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own
(on ) Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation, it's safe to say that Gruber's terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight are well, terroristic
As the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly , head towards the terrorist "office"
Immediately the chief guard here, Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis
Where are you going
'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first
them
or your husband
(to the approaching Fritz) Hi there
(worried) What are you going to do
Hey,  negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast
can handle these clowns
(to Fritz) want to talk to Hans
Hans
Sprickenzie talk
He doesn't wait for an answer
Fritz follows him
Holly worries
230                                                 230 (in mid-speech, angry) -- you wouldn't let me kill him when  had the chance -- If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already
don't want neutral
want dead -- at a rap on the door
Ellis is there
Hope 'm not interrupting
(to Fritz) What does he want
As Fritz shrugs: It's not what  want, it's what can give you
Look, let's be straight, okay
It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am right
Karl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug this asshole right now
But Hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis
(politely) You're very perceptive
(flattered) Hey,  read the papers,  watch 60 minutes,  say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening
They want something
Now, personally, don't care about your politics
Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business
figure, You're here to negotiate, am  right
You're amazing
You figured this all out already
Hey, business is business
You use a gun,  use a fountain pen, what's the difference
To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building
(smiling) Hans, baby
'm your white knight
(dryly) must have missed 60 Minutes
What are you saying
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up
can give him to you
As Hans reacts with real interest for the first time, we: : 231                                                    231 By the

You all right

He grimaces, mouth full
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies
Yucck
What do they put in these things
(reciting) 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5
' (laughing) You sound like a man with a couple of kids
Not yet, the wife in working on our first
You got any kids back on the ranch
McClane swallows Twinkie with a grimace, takes out his wallet, flips it open to a picture of himself and Holly and the kids in happier days
Two
And 'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior
It's a date
You buy the ice cream
McClane laughs, stares at the photo, when suddenly another besides Powell's comes over his radio
' (o

, on ) Touching, cowboy, touching
(pause) Or should  call you Mister McClane
Mister officer John McClane on the McClane

McClane
My friends call me John Mac
You're neither
shithead
' have someone who wants to talk to you
very special friend who was at the party with you tonight
McClane's face falls
Oh, God
Eyes closed, he waits for the voice that tells him it's all over
' Hello, John boy
McClane's eyes open, showing equal parts of shock and hope
In the office,     Ellis as Hans gives him the
Ellis
Ellis has a cigarette, and a terrorist brings him a Diet coke
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you
know you think you're doing your job, and  can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out
None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works
(carefully) Ellis, what have you told them
told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party
McClane sighs, partially relieved
Hans meanwhile, narrows his eyes
Ellis
you shouldn't be doing this
Tell me about it
He looks at Hans, who gives him a nod
All right
John, listen to me
They want you to tell them where the detonators are
They know people are listening
They want the detonators of they're going to kill me
Ellis gives Hans a big "ok" sign
Hans returns it
236
-  ,  -      236 and others listening intently
McClane closes his eyes and leans his head back again
He knows what is going to happen, even if this poor bastard Ellis doesn't
' John, didn't you hear me
(to , quietly) Yeah,  hear you, you fucking moron
John,  think you could get with the program a little
The police are here now
It's their problem
Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt
Hey, 'm putting my life on the line for you buddy
Don't you think  know that
Put Hans on
Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but  do -- Good
Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life
You're not part of this equation
It's time to realize that
Saying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling
Ellis smiles, too
What am , a method actor
Hans, babe, put away the gun
This is radio, not television
That asshole's not my friend
barely know him
hate his fucking guts -- (desperately sincere) -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me -- John, how can you say that, after all these years--

Ellis looks at Hans and shrugs, "Well,  tried
" Hans nods understandingly
He takes the , presses the  button, and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to Ellis' forehead and

'  -                           239 He throws open the door to let McClane and the police hear the screams of the hostages
Hear that
Talk to me, where are my detonators
Where are they or shall shoot another one
Sooner or later

(after a beat) Go fuck yourself

Goddamn, didn't you hear him
He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them -- Christ, can't you read between the lines
He did everything he could to save him
if he gave himself up they'd both be dead
Maybe
And maybe they'd at least be talking to us
Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this 'll put him behind bars myself
(amused) He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him
Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling

We have no wish for further loss of life
What do you wish for, Mister Gruber
have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison

now it can rattle it for me

Hasseldorf, what can we expect in the next few hours
Well, Gail, by this time the hostages and their captors should be entering the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome
As in Helsinki, Sweden

Finland
Basically, it's when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and projection of dependency

(over Hans' ) What can only be described as a strange sort of trust and bond develops
We've had situations where hostages have embraced their captors after their release and in one case even corresponded with them in prison
249
-                           249 Hans turns, looks up at the ceiling
Too dim up there to see from here
He sighs, sets his gun down on a buttress, starts to climb up, not enjoying it

Right over there
Robinson looks at Powell, adjusts his clothing, fixes his tie
(dryly) You want a breath mint
Robinson glares at him, then they move together towards: 255                                      255 Headlights still on, dominating the area where it sits
Robinson steps up, sees: 256

And then Hans turns, looks up
The transformation in his expression and bearing are mind- boggling
Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: --ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, know it -- (thrown, unsure) Whoa, whoa, easy man
won't hurt you
Who are you
What are you looking for
Hans' eyes dart towards: 260                                      260 Where a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible
261                                                 261 way up to the roof
thought could signal for help -- He starts in that direction
Forget it
They got a guy up there
You want to stay alive, keep moving
Hey
You hear me
Hans realizes this tack won't work
He follows McClane
You
you're an American
(friendly, easing the man's fears) Only if New Jersey counts
It works
The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile
: 261-                                           261- (in mid-speech to ) We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five hostages, probably on the 30th floor
seven, maybe eight terrorists
(to Big Johnson) Sounds like a standard -7 scenario
Big Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson
Thank you
We'll handle it from here
When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know
He starts to move away with his partner
(angry) Aren't you forgetting something
Johnson and Johnson turn
Robinson wants Powell to shut up
Such as
(pointing to the building) John McClane
He's the man who gave us all the information we've got
He's the reason you're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve
He's inside
Who is he
(nodding) He may be a cop
we're checking on that -- One of yours
(too quickly) No, sir
(after a moment) If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage
he's just not part of the equation
They start to walk away
(indignant) that's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said
(interested) Really
(to Big Johnson) That's one good thing
Sound like we're dealing with pros
They leave
: 262                                            262 McClane and Hans walk together
Hans is still a "nervous wreck
" (nodding) There was a party -- celebration -- all of a sudden they were there -- shooting -- threatening us -- 263                                                  263 McClane looks at this poor civilian, on the edge of going to pieces
He puts his hand on his shoulder
Relax, man
you smoke
Hans nods, still "frightened"
McClane takes out his spoils of war, the Marlboros
Two left
He sighs, takes one, offers the other one with an expression like a little boy forced to share a cookie
McClane takes out a lighter, does his and Hans'
Hans nods, grateful
then peers at McClane
You
you don't work for Nakatomi
and if you're not one of them
'm a cop from New York
(puzzled) New York
(explaining) They invited me to the Xmas party
Who knew
Hans' eyes take in his bare feet
Better than being caught with your pants down, right
(extending his hand) John McClane
(shaking hands) William Clay
(smiling) Call me Bill
McClane nods, friendly like, and his eyes glance casually over at: 264       -                   264 In alphabetical order
the "c's":  , : ,
: ,
265                                                 265 Bill, you know how to use a handgun
(hesitant) One weekend  went to a combat ranch
(apologetic) You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint
Must sound pretty silly to you
Sounds better than nothing
McClane takes out his Baretta, pops out the magazine, jams in a fresh one and hands it to him
Time for the real thing
McClane turns, moves on
we   him until he  to a He slowly turns: 265-                                                  265- Hans is
well, Hans again, from expression to posture
He holds the pistol aimed at McClane's face and talks calmly into his radio in German
Karl
Franco
'm on 33
Come quickly
(to McClane) Put down your gun and give me my detonators
McClane just looks at him
Hans
Your Hans
(nods, indicating McClane's gun again) Put it down now
That was tricky, with the accent
bet you do a great Ed Sullivan
Why do you need the detonators, Hans
already used the explosives
'm going to count to three
(cold) Yeah
Like you did with Takagi
McClane raises his machine gun, aims at Hans
Hans Click
Astonishment
Click-click-click
McClane steps in carefully, reclaims his pistol
You think 'm a shmuch, Hans
Hans pales as we hear the ding of an approaching elevator
You were saying
McClane whirls in time to see: 266-                                                   266- 269                                                          269 260     ,                                  270 Coming out of it,

He  to Karl in German: The glass
Shoot the glass
And, saying this, he demonstrates
Karl follows suit

Big with electronic  and  as a million Gigabytes goes to  heaven
McClane reaches the end of the counter,  and rolls to the floor: 282                                                   282 goes right down on a jagged

284                                               284 Karl looks pissed as hell
Behind him, Hans sifts through rubble, then comes over, smiling
He's holding the bag of detonators

McClane tries to wrap paper towels on the foot but his grimace shows that is still hurts like hell

What's the odds
You don't want to know
Suddenly remembering an  course in first aid from ten years ago, McClane removes the improvised bandage, check the cut more carefully

You liked lousy coffee, or what
Powell doesn't answer right away
At the same time, McClane swallows, seeing a gleam inside his foot
He gingerly probes, and pulls out a shard of glass almost three inches long from its angled gash, his mouth twisted in a silent scream all the way

He turns back and looks at her
He smiles
Mrs
McClane
How nice to make your acquaintance
He raises his weapon
but he only shoot it into the ceiling, making everyone jump
(shouting) On your feet, everyone
Upstairs, now

Uli nods and he and Eddie help herd everyone towards the stairs

grabs Holly himself

Better this way, isn't it
mean, any faggot can shoot a gun
This time Karl doesn't take the bait
Then, when he does charge, it's unexpected
The two men fight brutally, Karl bringing years of martial training to this moment, McClane bringing nothing but the street

334                                          334 Following them with their eyes, for once sharing the same opinion
335                                          335 They see their very own Christmas decorations, the friendly copter lights, and begin to smile and cheer
Uli smiles to himself, moves towards the door: 336                                                  336 Theo closes the lid of a bond-stuffed case, carries it out of the room
Holly's eyes follow his exit while the others continue
(to Hans, scornfully) After all your posturing, all your speeches
you're nothing but a common thief
'm an exceptional thief, Mrs
McClane
And now that 'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite

Another one
McClane is staggering
He gets in one hard punch and then Karl charges at him
McClane falls backwards, drives his legs upwards, propelling Karl into the air: 338                                                   338 Karl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes entangled
339                                                    339 jumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain

McClane snatches up his Baretta from the floor, runs out

Smoking Baretta in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped twitching
As the hostages  and , McClane snatches up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof
He charges through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof
She meets him halfway
Where's Holly -- The took her -- after they saw the kids on television -- What

Closer yet
He turns,

All of you, get down to the lower floors -- you're all in danger
What are you, crazy
We're being rescued
Those helicopters -- -- there won't be shit for those helicopters to land on, because the whole top of this building is wired with explosives
Now get below -- But
we're safe up here -- Safe, my ass
This ain't a helipad, it's a launching pad
And he  over their heads
They , head for the door as he hoped
He  again, raking a line across the roof
They really haul ass
344         - -                         344 is here with a rifle and a partner
(into throat mike, looking out the door) Flight leader, this is Wing
think they're on to us
One of the terrorists is firing on the hostages
345                                      345 (into mike) Roger, Wing
We copy
(to the pilot) Swing around
(raising his rifle) Give me a clear shot
The pilot nods
346
346 (supervising the work) Schnell, schnell
der zeitz ist kurz
Something catches his eye
He turns, looks at: 347        --
347 Through the glass here he can catch a glimpse of the hostages coming back into the room
: 348                                                    348 McClane herds the last of the hostages inside, starts for the door himself, when with a  and a  of rotors, the lead chopper zooms overhead
McClane throws himself down on the ground, looks up as the chopper banks in a tight turn and then from the open side  erupts
Shocked, McClane  out of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door
349      -    (  )          349 descending,  and  as a chopper  past a window on a loop back towards the roof
350                                               350 Both Johnsons Bank and we'll nail him
351                                               351 Hans whirls towards Kristoff
Blow the roof
Now
But Karl and Uli are up there -- to show the remote detonator on a table
Hans goes to it
352                                                    352 McClane  away from another burst
You assholes, 'm on your side --
They come in on another pass
Desperate, he looks around, see a fire hose
Makes up his mind
With the chopper behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose, unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs
He looks over the edge, hesitates: Fuck this
Bullets  all around him
He : 353                                               353 Hans extends the antenna
the button
354       -                                    354 The helipad
rolls into the sky
355                                                355 lose their footing on the floor
Dust and debris fall down, but they're okay
356       '                          356 to avoid the rising fireball
can't
It's  in the explosion
It tips over, a rotor hits the roof -- it , , tumbles down the side of the building
357                                                    357 Dangling against the side of the building, he  and winces as   soar past him
358       -                             358 Flame   it, engulfs it
It  on its foundation 180 degrees as several bolts slip: 359                                                    359 several more feet
He swallows, then  against the side of the building, his bloody feet leaving smears
The shatterproof glass doesn't budge
Wincing as more sizzles by, McClane levels the machine gun,  off from the building,  back ten feet -- reaches the zenith of his arc --  the gun and sails back in: 360                                          360 McClane  through the shattered glass,  inside, rolls onto the floor,  through furniture and decor
Finally he , catches his breath with relief
rises to one knee: 361                                                361 The fire hose mounting is  off the roof,  past the : 362                                         362 The hose mechanism tumbles downward
363                                                     363 McClane is  off his feet, dragged towards the window
364        -                               364 It  down the side of the building
The hose on the edge of the windowsill, dragging McClane towards his death
365                                                    365 at the floor
no help
Inches from the shattered window, he braces his legs against the sill, groans as he fights the weight of the hose and the reel
One foot
Only his already wounded foot keeps him indoors
He scrambles to untie his improvised rappeling rig -- gets free just before the hose nozzle  out and into the great beyond
Winded, strength ebbing, he staggers to his feet -- just in time for: 366                                                    366 to  from another staggering explosion
367                                                367 They scream, cry out: 368                                             368 As Holly covers her head from falling plaster, the men work like automatons, piling up the bonds
369                                                    369 recovers from another , runs up the steps -- is momentarily amazed to  a "ding" from the elevator -- he looks at: 370                                                   370 where suddenly the    as an , swinging on its cable like a demolition ball on a crane
371                                                371 McClane runs up the steps as brickwork flies past his head like schrapnel: 372                                                372 reaches the apex of its swing, drops down in an arcing turn: 373                                                   373 the elevator  into the stairs
The section McClane in on
At the last minute McClane  towards: 374                                       374 and catches it as stairs and elevator  behind and beneath him
With his last effort, he hauls himself onto the balcony and them moves off
: 375
375 The police are scrambling for cover
Powell and Robinson are open-mouthed
376                                              376 Argyle is huddled down on the floor of the back seat, the stuffed animal held over his head as much for company as protection
As the building ceases to  Argyle sneaks a peek out from under the fur
and sees: 377
-                                      377 at the delivery truck
He steps into a white paramedic's jumpsuit and zips it up
He hops into the cab and pulls the truck away from the loading dock
378      -                              378 He creeps forward, looks carefully into: 379
-                                 379 They're getting ready to leave with the bearer bonds
Suddenly the
380                                                380 McClane's face shows his anguish
He checks the weapon he took from Uli
One bullet
(under his breath) Shit
He checks his Baretta
One bullet
He thinks, desperate
Decides
He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to the Baretta clip
He slams the pistol clip back, really worried
Mind racing, he looks all around the room
his eyes fall on a tape dispenser
He thinks again
steps towards it: 380-                                            380- Theo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into the back
car engine fires up inside the delivery truck
381                                                     381 Realization dawning, he vaults into the front seat
382                                                  382 paramedic van shoots out of the back of the Pacific Courier delivery truck
Flooring the limo, Argyle  into the van, which  into the wall
383                                                     383 Theo staggers out in time for Argyle to deck him with one punch
(looking around) Where's the camera when you need them
: 384                                               384 Let's move
The last of the money is piled on
Hans hangs onto Holly while Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags
Kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape
suddenly he is   by a rifle butt
385                                                      385 McClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above
He holds the machine gun ready
Hans
Hans turns, not that surprised
Grinning, he yanks Holly into view
No words need be said
John
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this
(taking in the vault) So that's what it was
fucking robbery
(thinking) So why nuke the building, Hans
(with a shrug) When you steal six hundred dollars, you can disappear
but when you steal six hundred million, they will find you
unless you play dead
(tight smile) Which happens to be your next role
drop your gun, please
McClane hesitates
Hans pushes the gun against Holly again, really hurting her
Eddie quickly raises his weapon
(to Eddie) Nein, dies ein ist mein
(to McClane) This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly
That was Gary Cooper, shithead
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes
(slowly putting down his gun) Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy
'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'
Now you are fucked
He aims: Holly, now
Instantly, Holly sidesteps,  her elbow into Hans' face
386      -                             386 At the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta from its hiding place       , Hans high in the chest
The bullet passes right  Hans, and the  behind him  with blood and
Even while this is happening, McClane : 387      -  '               387 Eddie takes a gunshot,  just like on Gunsmoke
388                                                388 Hans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock
389                                                    389 You were right about us Americans
(he blows smoke from his pistol barrel) We are cowboys
390       -                                     390 Incredibly, Hans still stands, eyes filled with shock and disbelief
He , falls against the windowsill, starts to -- and then he  his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he : 391     '                                          391 and she is  off her feet
392                                                392 Hans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him
McClane forward, catches her inside arm near the elbow at the last minute
393
-                               393 The roof still in flames, McClane hangs halfway out of the window, jagged glass raking his face, straining to hold onto Holly as Hans drags her out
McClane braces himself against the window frame and strains to pull Holly closer
With a , she catches the windowsill with her inside hand
McClane  with his other hand, begins to  towards Holly's wristband
394     '  -                                     394 death grip on the watchband
We ,  that, blood flecked teeth , he is  with his other hand to bring up the gun he is still holding
395                                                    395 Holly's  alerts him
Hans locks eyes with McClane one last time, starts to pull the trigger, as: 396                                                  396 McClane  the latch on the watchband
The overtaxed metal , links flying: 397                                                      397 Hans' face registers his horror as he and most of the watch suddenly drop
We  to his scream all the way down, finally  him
McClane pulls Holly back into the room and holds her
It's okay, babe
It's okay
He looks down at Hans' body, then back at the scrap of wristband he's still holding
You got a warranty on this
She laughs through her tears, holds onto him
: 398
-                                   398 Smoke drifts up from what has suddenly become the top floor
Thornburg's remote truck careens into the parking lot
399                                                     399 crowd watches as the front doors of the building open
We McClane, who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by men
As  start shouting questions, McClane breaks free of his entourage, and, holding Holly, pushes into the crowd
(calling out) Al
Al, you here --
The crowd eddys and surges
suddenly Powell is there, and McClane knows it's him
They stare at each other, ten feet apart, and then they're grinning, extending their hands
But somehow a shake isn't enough, and they're embracing each other like men who've lived through combat together
which, in fact, is the truth
(emotional) Al
Man, you were my rock couldn't have made it without you
Bullshit
'm serious
Hey, this is my wife
Holly Gennero
(taking Powell's hand, correcting) Holly McClane
Hearing this, McClane grins, pulls her close
* (to her) pleasure
guess John doesn't need me to give you that message anymore
(puzzled) Message
McClane begins to make silent "ixney" gestures in Powell's direction
You know, about him being such a jerk -- and how he's really sor -- (seeing McClane) -- ee
Uh, 'm sure he'll fill you in
Just then Robinson barges forward
want you for debrief, McClane
You've got some things to answer for -- Ellis' murder -- property damage -- interfering with police                    * business -- causes McClane to turn
400
400 There in the doorway is Karl, clothing and body scorched
Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane, he holds his machine gun
401
401 As the crowd panics trying to escape, Karl locks eyes with McClane and levels his gun
McClane throws Holly to the ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinson's sidearm
But he doesn't get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl -- knocking him back through the doorway
McClane looks back to see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his
38
His hand is rock steady
He sees McClane's look
(shrugging) You were right
You couldn't have made it without me
They smile
Suddenly McClane and Holly squint as  pan onto them
Thornburg pushes his way forward, mike extended like a weapon
Mr
McClane
Mrs
McClane
any comment on your incredible ordeal
What are your feelings now that it's all over
Without a beat, Holly   in the chops
He , dropping the mike with an electronic
McClane looks at his wife, amazed
Behind them, Thornburg sits on the ground, * nurses his lip, turns to his camerman
(eager)                                       * Did you get that
McClane and Holly continue on, turn towards:                  * 402     '                                          402 It's a little smashed up, but still running
Argyle is standing beside the open door
McClane and Holly get in and Argyle closes the door
(getting in the front) If this is their idea of Christmas gotta be there for New Year's
the read window where McClane and Holly are kissing
As they drive off, we: Twentieth Century Fox 10201
