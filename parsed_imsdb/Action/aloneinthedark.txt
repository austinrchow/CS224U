The forest is pitch black
Young Edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything,  for breath
He doesn't turn to look behind him
He just runs as fast as he can

Its is skewed, inhuman
It is gaining on him
As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees
Something is up ahead, something bright
Edward runs towards it
Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light
: The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge of the forest
What is making the light isn't visible, only Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light

There's a   sound
Deputy Adams stops
He carefully peers around behind the transformer
The space is too small for a full-size person
But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young Edward

He takes off his jacket and wraps it around Young Edward's shoulders
Young Edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles, still scared, but happy to see the Deputy

He sits in a large commercial airplane
The compartment is full of seated

The Small Boy's  (early 40s) sleeps next to him
Did you have a nightmare
Carnby looks at the Small Boy, curious
He doesn't respond
(') You ate cheese with dinner
My mommy says cheese gives you nightmares
Want to see my coloring book
The Small Boy has a Halloween-themed coloring book open on his lap
It's a graveyard scene, full of cartoon drawings of ghosts, werewolves, and vampires
(') think there's a vampire living in my closet, but my mommy says vampires and ghosts aren't real
She says there's nothing to be afraid of in the dark
Carnby weighs what he's going to say
Your mother is wrong
Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive
The Small Boy's eyes open wide
Everybody else tells me not to be afraid
That's because they don't know the truth

He doesn't carry a suitcase
(
) So, maybe you're thinking 'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason
But that's where you're wrong
Because 've got my reasons
There's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see
You've willfully closed your eyes
But your fear of the dark is not a weakness
It's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see
My eyes were forced open a long time ago
Now  know
Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you
Carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row
The taxi shifts into gear and drives off
Another taxi is parked up ahead

But it is clearly not a human face
Carnby puts the carving back in his trench-coat pocket
You travel light
Trust me, 'm carrying enough baggage for the both of us
The Cabbie  as he steers through traffic
That's pretty funny, man
What do you do
You really want to know
Yeah, man
Hearing about my passengers' lives keeps the job interesting

Get the fuck outta here

'm an effective solution to unusual problems
Carnby turns to look out the back windshield

For Dr
Hudgens, from Dr

It's probably an error
It must be for the big Abkani show

What the hell's Abkani

They were this super-advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared

Hudgens

We've got Abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world

Aline holds it up, fascinated
Where is Hudgens anyway
The show opens in a few days

So he sticks you with the work
At least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend

Hudgens stands over the large, barnacle-covered container
The container is secured with a heavy rusted lock
Two large, muscular men, the   and  , check the chains connecting the container to the huge crane on the deck
They are preparing to load it onto the truck on the Dock
Don't you want to open it
Make sure it's what you're looking for
The conditions must be perfect
Otherwise, there will be
consequences
Captain Chernick steps up to the barnacle-covered container
He notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten scraped off in the transport
Under the barnacles, the container is revealed to made of gold
Chernick look startled
Captain Chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and looks closely at it
Is this made of solid gold
Did you know the Abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables
They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits
Thousands of years later, we don't even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place
Now, let's load it onto the truck
Captain Chernick exchanges a look with the First Mate and Crewman Barnes
They both give him a subtle nod

He looks through the peephole in the door
The peephole is dirty, hard to see through
Something frantic is happening outside the door, but it's hard to see exactly what
There is more  and then
Short  of follow, and more
And then, all is quiet
Hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door handle, wedging it closed
He backs away from the door
The only weapon he can see is a box-cutter
He grabs it, holding it out in front of him
Suddenly, there's a  at the door
Something pushes at the door, trying to get in
The door  and  from the impact
Hudgens, still holding the box-cutter, strains against the door, using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut

He looks around the Deck
Mist blows in off the water
The night is quiet
Bodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate, Crewman Barnes, the other Crewmen
Their weapons lie next to their slashed, ripped open bodies
Bullet holes are pocked around the Deck
Streaks of blood are smeared everywhere
Shell casings and corpses are all that remain of the battle
Tense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the empty gold container
He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container
The panel opens, revealing a small artifact
The artifact is a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one end
It is covered in Abkani symbols
Hudgens takes out the artifact

That information's classified
If you were still an agent, you'd already know
But since you're not, stay out of my way
Burke turns to stride away
Carnby grabs his arm
Burke turns back, annoyed

Burke grabs Carnby's arm, trying to twist it away
But Carnby's fast enough to slip out of Burke's hold
Now angry, Burke grabs Carnby by the collar, shoving him against a stone column

He brings up a series of anatomical schematics of the xenomorph creatures
Two years ago
They've been 713's top priority ever since
But it's been almost exclusively in rural areas
This kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented
Have you isolated any weaknesses
Fischer brings up an image of the periodic table
Most metals pass right through them
So normal bullets and blades are useless
But they're vulnerable to elements 76 to 79
Osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold
Negates their ability to disrupt electricity
If they disrupt electricity, why did my flashlight still work
The closer the current to its power source, the less disruption
Fischer takes a hand-held para-meter scanning device off a rack
It is a sleek, updated version of Carnby's para-meter, similar to the Agents' rifle-mounted scanners
(') This is calibrated to track their disruption field
It won't help you see them, but you'll know when they're nearby
Fischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures' disruption field, displaying how it works
(') They live almost exclusively in darkness
Sunlight's lethal in large doses
But only certain light frequencies hurt them
Fischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the counter in front of them

The cage appears to be empty
But suddenly, an invisible creature  into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens
As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second

Hudgens turns up the dial
In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature

Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light
He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station
Carnby unwraps the items
They are the three Abkani artifacts from the Museum
Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around

Carnby fiddles with the artifact
Suddenly, the artifact telescopes out
Instead of one thick ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled on the other, with a common hollow middle

The computer processes the information
Hundreds of map images flash across the screen as the computer searches for a match

Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them
Barr clearly respects Carnby's abilities
The Loft is still dark
Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no longer registers any creatures
We're clear, sir
Burke looks around at the remains of the battle
The Loft is totally trashed

Sir, this one's infected too
Agent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse
His scanning device
She has a spinal-worm too
Got another one here
Burke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby
The red laser- sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest
Taking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all train their weapons on Carnby
Several glowing red dots hover on his chest
Drop your weapon and get down on the ground

Something grabs the Agent,  him back against the wall, and rips out his neck
It's another , with the same fierce, gaunt look and clear irises
Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening
Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke
Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby
Carnby's bullet  past Burke and hits an  dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead
The Orphan was about to pounce on Burke
There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another
Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life
The  attack
They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage
Like Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast, and deadly
They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with sunken eyes and nearly clear irises
The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce
They bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw around the Agents and tear them apart
The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking through the darkness

Spinal shot's a kill shot
With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand against the Orphans' attack
The Orphans are fast and deadly, but they have no organization
Now that the Agents have a handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns
Soon, the battle is over
Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and dead Orphans lie littered around Carnby's destroyed Loft
Only Carnby, Aline, Burke, Miles, Barr, Cheung, Marko, and Turner remain alive

They shine their lights around the dark room
They are in a large abandoned Bureau 713 Lab
Thick dust covers all surfaces
But it was once a high-tech facility
On one side of the Lab is a sliding metal door
What is this place
Medical equipment, scientific instruments, and computers have been left as they were, untouched for two decades
series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall
In each tube, a spinal-worm lies dead, floating in gelatinous liquid Aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another wall
They are anatomical schematics for the spinal-worms
There are also diagrams of the human body with markings isolating key areas of the spinal cord
Carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins, each about the size of a child
() 90
: Each basin has a small metal tag on it
Carnby wipes the layer of dust off one of the metal tags
The tag reads:
This is where it happened

Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors
Next to the hangar doors is a control panel
Barr pulls the front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank
Barr pulls on the hand-crank
It won't give
Carnby joins him and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank
The hand- crank  into the open position
An old mechanism is engaged
The hangar doors slide open, revealing another doorway behind them
But this one is clearly not part of the Lab
It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani symbols
The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock
It looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door
In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening
line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door
One symbol is prominent among the others: the
Edward, look
() : (2) Aline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device
It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door
The same   pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin
So it's a key
Burke surveys the room with a grim expression
say we got two options
One, we open this door, deal with whatever's on the other side
The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea
Two, we set enough -4 to bury this place
Keep whatever's in there, down here for good
Carnby stares at the gold door
The answers 've been looking for my whole life could be in there
Some doors are locked for a reason
Carnby looks away from the gold door
Barr
how much -4 you got left
Barr pulls open his pack, revealing several packages of -4
Enough to blow this place to
Barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head
Blood spurts out as Barr collapses to the ground, dead
Hudgens stands behind them, carrying two pistols

Before they can react, Hudgens presses a pistol to Aline's throat
He points the other pistol at Burke and Carnby
(') Now drop your weapons and back away
Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back
Carnby glares at Hudgens
It was 713
Our early work was crude,  admit
But eventually we perfected the implant process
You were our last failure, Carnby
If you hadn't escaped, 713 never would've shut down the experiments
Burke's eyes flash with anger
There's no way this was sanctioned
Before your kind took over, 713 had very different
priorities
Now, you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it
've wasted twenty years working in secret because of short-sighted men like you
Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding

Aline's expression is firm, unafraid
She grips the device tightly
Hudgens is about to pull the trigger

Enough people have died today
Aline sees Carnby is serious
She holds out the device to Hudgens
You couldn't have opened it anyway
Not without this
Hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on the Erebus
He hands it to Aline
Aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at the bottom of the device, turning it into place
The device is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom
With one pistol pointed at Burke and Carnby and the other at Aline, Hudgens directs her to the gold door

But knew it was something more
It was the first

The doorway opens up into a vast Cave, hundreds of feet high and wide, stretching off into darkness
The cave walls are rough-hewn rock, untouched by human hands
The walls of the Cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds of tunnels, pocking the rock like a hive, leading off into the depths of the mountain
Hudgens moves into the Cave, tentative, but excited
Suddenly, there's a ,  sound
xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels
Out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph
And a third
Across the vast cave, dozens of xenomorphs creep out of individual tunnels
Hudgens steps further into the Cave
The xenomorphs approach him, their heads darting about
The xenomorphs surround Hudgens on all sides
His steps are careful
He reaches his hand out to one of the creatures

Great clouds of dust and rock fragments billow out of the Entrance Hall
he whole mountain  from the detonation

181J Aline and Carnby get to their feet outside the Storm Cellar
Smoke pours out of the Shaft
But as he sees where he really is, Carnby is stunned
He stares up at the Orphanage
They were under us the whole time

/                                           181K Carnby and Aline walk through the Orphanage
It is clean, well-maintained
But no one is there
The Orphanage is empty
Where are all the children
The door to the Children's Room is ajar
Carnby opens the door

Sister Clara lies dead on one of the children's beds
The blankets and sheets are soaked with blood
bloody gash has been sliced up each of Sister Clara's arms
blood-stained straight-razor sits on the bedside table
crumpled piece of paper is clutched in one of Sister Clara's hands
Carnby takes the paper and uncrumples it
The notes reads: " ,

-                                             181M Aline and Carnby step out of the Orphanage
Carnby looks around, troubled
No one is visible outside the Orphanage
Something's very wrong
182, 183, 183A - 184                                                                      184 Carnby and Aline walk along a deserted street
The sun rises above them
It's a beautiful day
Shops look ready to open
Cars are parked along the streets
But no one is driving
The neighborhood is empty
185, 186,  187 - Carnby and Aline walk down a wide street in the middle of the city's downtown core
No one is visible anywhere
Edward
what's going on
Carnby looks ashen
They stand in the middle of a downtown intersection, empty streets stretching out in all directions
Remember what Hudgens said
was his last failure
He said he perfected the implant process
() It can't be
Then where the hell is everybody
Where's everybody gone
We look down at Carnby and Aline, alone in the intersection, empty streets all around them
We start to float up above them, getting a wider and wider bird's eye view of the city
We swoop up higher above them, but still, no one is visible anywhere in the city
We float up until the entire city stretches out below us
Nothing moves
No one can be seen
(
) (') Here's what  know
There are two worlds on this planet
world of light and a world of darkness
For millions of years, these worlds were in balance
But now, the lights of human civilization burn everywhere
The dark places are disappearing
We forced them to come out of the shadows
Now, it's my job to force them back in
My name is Edward Carnby
'm here to protect you from things you don't believe in
We start to drop back down, faster and faster, the ground rushing towards us
We are descending directly above Carnby and Aline, standing alone in the empty intersection
We swoop down right in front of Carnby
His trench-coat blows in the wind
Aline stands next to him, ready
Carnby reloads his revolver
(') Aline
Yes Edward
It's going to be a busy day
The sun shines down above them, illuminating the deserted city streets
Carnby's expression is determined
