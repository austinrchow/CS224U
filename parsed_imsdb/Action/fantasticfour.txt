Heya Susie
(under breath, to Reed) One more thing he's got
Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug
Ben, it's been too long
She gives Reed a polite handshake
Victor watches carefully
Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze
little tongue-tied
You're, you've,  mean, how have you bee-- Never better
Victor sizes them up
He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder
This isn't going to be a problem, is it
Not at all

Victor smiles, eyeing Sue
Good

We could save lives
Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings
Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it

They look at Victor
How does he know all this

Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no
But Reed
drops a nod
Done
Victor smiles, offers a handshake

'm just worried about what he wants
Speaking of which
Reed follows Ben's eyes to
She joins them
Doors shut

He nods, head down
He doesn't want eye contact
Those solar winds are flaring, but factored them into my coordinates and -- was talking about us
Working together
Sue holds her eyes on Reed
He is clearly uncomfortable in her gaze
Did the elevator just get smaller
(thinking, talking fast) Well, uh, based on our history
you can handle the biogenetics, and 'll focus on the molecular physics
Or, uhm, maybe  should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho-- (droll, a little annoyed) Right
That's exactly what  meant
She shakes her head -- same old Reed
He looks at her -- what did he say wrong
Ben smiles, patting Reed on the shoulder
Way to not overthink it
(to Sue) So when do we leave
'll schedule the launch
Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
She offers a business card
Reed doesn't take it

Ben grimaces

Isn't that your speech
He's made a few changes
This is your dream, Reed
You should be the one up there
Victor's better at these things
Just past the press area, they see

This is , Ben's fiancee

Ben looks at the little   on her finger
Soon as 'm back, 'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock

(to Reed) You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man
Reed nods, smiles
Debbie gives Ben a last kiss
Ben turns to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile
What the hell you smiling at
Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs -- Actually, the engines are SMEs

Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it
Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would bring that up

Reed cuts it: Let's start loading those samples
Get your suit ready, Ben
Victor keeps his eyes on Ben
So you still do all the heavy lifting
Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed
(') Maybe you should have stayed back in the lab
Field work never suited you
Reed doesn't defend himself
Ben steps up
He does the talking

Victor holds tight to his smile
He nods, condescending
Got it
So take a walk, Ben

Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart, each containing a variety of plants
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister
'Course not
Strictly business
Yeah, well, his eyes say different
Hey, two hearts got busted last time
Maybe she's not over it either
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God
Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp
Hmmm, it's a toss-up
Put your tiny little mind at ease

You've been with me two years now

She treads lightly
It's been a good two years, Victor
The company's accomplished so much
Right, of course, the company
But you see, 've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with -- Uh, Victor,  hope  haven't done something to make you think

Ben's still out there -- So reel him in
But we came here to do a job
So let's do it

Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window

This is serious
Turn around
Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him
Ben turns and sees:   , rumbling toward the station
Not close, but not far
That gets Ben's attention
( ) Roger that, on my way
He turns back towards the ship

Sees the others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching cloud on another
Anxiety creeps across his face

They heard the automated voice
It panics Reed
Come on, Ben, come on

The cloud's tendrils snake toward him

Sue glares at Victor
His lack of compassion shocks her
( ) Not until Ben is back inside
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us
Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response
He takes over the console, punching keys

Raising the shields
You can't leave them out there
Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster
Watch me
Reed had his chance
You can't help them any more than  can

With one final glare, she bolts from the room

Thinks

Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage
He's not going either

Not panicked
With determination

In agonizing, weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside
The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange stains
Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him
Ben hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether

: Just  the exterior air-lock door closes, a zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben in the back, ripping through his suit
The exterior door shuts and seals
The station loses all power

Power quietly flickers on
Silence
Time resumes
All four pick up exactly where they left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them

He stands, checks his body
few scrapes, nothing serious
thin, throbbing  on his head
He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding

They try to remove his helmet

He's not responsive -- Ben

Stable
We're looking at low twenties
It's a good number, considering the fallout from -- Reed's disaster
You know,  half- think he did this to me on purpose
Sir, 'm sure he wouldn't put himself -- But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing
Get me on the  shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal
(staring into silver tray) 've got to do something about this scar
Make sure they only shoot my right side
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you
And that's a good thing
Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect
It glistens in the silver tray
His eyes are bloodshot, sleepless
You know, maybe you should get some rest -- Later
First, 've got some unfinished business
deal that needs closing
Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread
beat
Sir, 've always wondered
Why Sue
You could have any woman in the world but -- That's why
Because  could have any other woman
You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine
" - Two dozen  sit and eat
Others serve themselves at the buffet
Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall -- can only stay for one drink, Ben
've got to meet with Victor
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting
They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door
(') Hey Reed, what are you doing here
(before he can answer) Great, why don't you join us
He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table
Ben's stomach ; so loud that they all can hear it
(') God, 'm starving
Gonna hit the buffet
Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time
- The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners
The room is darker, more romantic
Ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously
Pardon me
Sue and Reed stare at him
Ben's stomach growls again
Are you alright
think  need to lie down
Bad shrimp
This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well, unsteady when he walks away
He looks down at his stomach
(') Really bad shrimp
: Fireplace
Sue looks gorgeous in the light

long beat
Reed doesn't know where to start with this woman
Feeling better
Yes, thanks
That's good
That's uh
good
You always had a way with words
(an awkward beat) should be getting back
Sue gets up to leave
Exasperated, Reed tries to think of something, anything, to say
'm really happy for you and Victor
She slows down, looking at him
She was hoping for more
You're happy for me and Victor
can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship -- Which was
Passion
We see surprise on Sue's face, and
(') For science
(frustrated) You are such a dork, Reed
You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics
As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around her
The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze
What
What did  say
She looks more disappointed than angry
It's never what you say
It's what you don't say
What you don't do
She lets that hang
lot of history here
Quiet, hurt -- she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion
just wanted to -- As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly
disappears
It's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy
(standing up, hurt) You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants
(Reed looks down) And it's nice to be wanted sometimes
To be heard
seen
Reed, look at me
He looks up
but all that's left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes
He drops his fork, shocked
Uh, Sue
can't
What
What do you mean you -- Sue
look at your hands
She raises her hands, but we don't see them
We only see a medical waistband
floating
Her watch
floating
Her clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air
Sue is invisible
She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a off the table
: The glass flies off the table, tumbling
Reed instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits -- Then snaps back into place
Reed stares at his arm in disbelief
Sue's eyes widen as well
The rest of Sue reappears
They look at each other: mutual alarm
(
) You guys will not believe what just happened
They look up to see  in the doorway,  except for the nurse's   wrapped around his midsection

Victor strides out, heading for the door
He runs his hand through his hair to comb some strays

He He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair
His
It is longer than the bandage now (as if it )
Victor peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray
Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected
-  - burst open
Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently walk
It has to be the cloud
It's fundamentally altered our
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
Reed glances over his shoulder
He stares
Sue follows his gaze to see: Johnny's  are on fire
He  his fingers
They
He's totally unharmed
Now what is up with that
(deadpan) The cloud has fundamentally altered our
Cool
What'd it do to you guys
Apparently  can disappear
Please tell me you go silent too
Only one thing on Reed's mind -- We have to find Ben
-  '  - Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive bursts of flame
He turns it on and off, like the "
" Flame on, flame off
Flame on, flame off -- Johnny
He does it again
Flame on, flame off
(') Stop it
Okay, "mom
" Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the banging, moaning and pleading inside
Johnny smiles
(') Oh, you dawg you
Better not be my nurse
- '  - (
) Ben, are you there
creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough and craggy
of grinding heavy rocks
(
) Open up Ben, we need to talk
It all stops
beat, then all four legs of the bed give way and it crashes to the floor
Under the covers, he groans in pain, and his voice is , , but definitely : -  '  - Reed decides they can't wait any longer
He kneels to the floor
He concentrates, not sure if it will work
Suddenly, his arm , - '  - Reed's arm wriggles under the door
It bends upward, swiping clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob
Rubbery fingers find the latch and unlock the door
-  '  - Reed focuses, and pulls
His arm snakes out from under the door and snaps back into place
His flesh and bones reforming before their eyes
Johnny stares at Reed
Ewwwwwwww
That is disgusting
They hear a tremendous  from inside the room
- '  - They open the door
The room is trashed
Every stick of furniture smashed to splinters
Ben
Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used to be
They rush to it
Looking out they see in the distance, running away
What is that thing
think that thing is Ben
Reed looks out, emotions roiling
Is that his best friend
Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage bigger)
What's going on
Victor, are you feeling alright
He considers, but never shows weakness
He nods
Just a little banged up
couple scrapes
Why
Ben did this
Ben did this
He's had some kind of
reaction to exposure from the cloud
And he's not the only one
We need to find him
Victor redirects his attention to Sue
(') Victor, 'm sorry  -- (cold) Just find him
Victor strides off, leaving the others
Anybody know where the big guy's going
We   on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed knows exactly where Ben is going
He's going home
- view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance
down to   , where we find empty cargo trains
We   on the main track, where

We hear a cargo  slide open, then
Big  hit the ground
Someone, or someTHING barrels into the night

Jackets rip, shoes split
He needs an extra extra extra large

It's Ben

Big fingers try to push keys but they're too large
Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more and more frustrated
He manages to press "0" with his pinky
Hello, Operator
Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a modest, working-class home
His eyes go soft when he sees Debbie grab the phone
(') Deb
It's me
need you to step out front
Out front
You home, baby
got a surprise for you
He blinks hard
Sad, dark
got a surprise for you too
- Debbie steps out
There is " " sign over the door
She looks out
The wind blows softly
Something shifts in the darkness
Debbie pulls her robe tighter
Ben
(
) Don't come any closer for a sec
This is gonna be kind of a shock
You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"
Baby, you're scaring me
hanging beat
And Ben
steps into the light, where we : he's , easily twice the size he once was, and
Debbie sees him
Fear washes over her, not sure what to think
He reaches out, a little tentative
She flinches back
Oh my -g-g
What did you
do to Ben
Deb, it's me
It's still me
He reaches out
She recoils
It's too much for her
Tears swell in her eyes
Covering her mouth, she backs away
He takes a step closer
She backs away faster, tripping over her robe, falling into the street
car screeches to a halt
Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries back
Don't
don't
'
Her shout wakes
Lights flicker on
Ben knows he has to go
He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time he'll see her
She trembles, terrified
His eyes go moist
love you, Deb
With that, he turns away
The " " sign flutters, falls to the ground
tragic tableau
As more lights go on around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn

The driver is too woozy
Ben can't get to the button
Frustrated, he simply    , and '  right out of the cab

They raise their guns
Ben looks at the cops

The whole bridge is  of bumper-to-bumper traffic
We one car: three doors pop open, and out come

They look through smoke and mayhem to see
their first full look at Ben
Reed stands gutpunched
Not even Ben deserves that
- Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it
He lunges behind a truck
The cops try to follow, but  push them back
Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious
He tries to hide from  around him and  on walkways overhead

Reed
What do we do

Sue gets closer to him

Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod
What

She understands
She concentrates, and starts to turn invisible
#1 What the hell is this
magic show
But her clothes don't go invisible
Beat
Reed mutters: Sue
Your clothes
Lose them
What
(realizes) Oh
She unbuttons her blouse
Not thrilled with the idea
She wriggles out of her pants
Down to her skivvies
She reaches back to undo her bra
momentarily loses concentration and becomes visible
The sight of Sue in her undies grabs the ' attention
Everyone watches, stunned
The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of bricks
Cops are transfixed
So is Reed
This is wrong in so many ways
You've been working out
Shut up
Sue takes a deep breath
Closes her eyes
Focuses
Nothing happens
She's embarrassed and furious

Jaws drop
Uh, Sue

She walks away
The cops watch her, gaping
By the time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone, disappearing into the clouds of smoke

He tries to see over a big , and his neck
He finally sees
Reed wraps around a car, and
His face snakes right in front of Ben
Ben jumps
What the --
Ben
Are you okay
Am  okay
You wanna explain that
He motions to Reed's neck
Then to his own body: (') Or this
What the hell am
'Cause sure ain't Ben anymore
Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer

The air seems to  around her hands, like -
She looks at them, surprised, confused

Bits and pieces tumble down at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet
All deadly now
The swoops down, with men
Ben
with all his might
Ben
His muscles ripple, and
he takes his first step
back
Another scream
Another step
Another
Another
Epic, painful
He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch
His footsteps
With monumental effort, he levels the truck
Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing over Ben
Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort
Ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted
Wary cops close in to cover him with weapons, but
The  slowly begin to
The crowd of onlookers joins in as well
Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised, touched by the reaction
But Ben seems uncomfortable
Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats; he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue
- Ben sees a familiar face in the masses:
Ben steps toward her, but she stops him with a look

Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand
Uh, sir
Larry King called, to cancel
(seeing the , a beat) Apparently, there's a bigger story
Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her with the jacket
And the penny drops: he's
As it hits him, he feels something odd
He looks down at his hand
at glints of gleaming  poking through flesh

They get ready to go, but the   enters, stopping them
There's some folks outside, want to talk to you
We're not going public with this
We're scientists, not celebrities
Too late, son
He turns on a little   in the corner plays on all stations, with the tagline:

The Fantastic Four
Nice
Johnny heads for the exit
Johnny, slow down
Let's think this through, a second
Johnny pauses
Rubs his chin once
And
Okay
Done thinking
He runs out
Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny cannot be their spokesman
They take off after him, out to -- -   - Fifty cameras flash
The field is full of press
Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd
Johnny eats up the attention

That'd be me
No seriously

Uh, during our recent mission to the Von Doom space station, we were exposed to as yet-unidentified radioactive energy, most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun-- Nobody came for a science class
crush of questions overwhelms Reed: What happened on the bridge
Does it hurt to stretch
Were you really on fire
Is it true that one of you can fly
Working on it
And it's a lot harder -- We don't know much more than you do, at this point
Which is why we will be going directly to the lab, where we can diagnose our symptoms and -- #2 Symptoms
So it's like a disease
Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt
Ben is lost in thought, looking at Deb's
Johnny leaps in
Symptoms
Please
If having powers is a disease, then yeah we got it
And we are gonna blow your minds
There's a new day dawning
The day of the Fantastic Four
#3 That thing doesn't look too fantastic
The Reporter nods toward Ben
Ben's fists tighten, the sound of rocks crushing together
Reed feels the pain
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde-- What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot
Reporters laugh
Ben turns his head away
Reed burns
Look, we went up to space to find a way to understand , to cure disease, save lives
Well, now it's our , our disease, our lives on the line

No more questions

You've got a week, Victor
One week to turn this around

Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we    -- -  - Victor and Leonard stride out
Victor is writhing
Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know preferred stock from livestock
Leonard is thinking all business
Sir
Reed's comments at that press conference killed us
How are we going to turn this around
Victor considers
His mind races, eyes narrow
Very simple

As the doors close behind him, he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed
-  - The elevator rises
Reed roils with guilt
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us
That's what we're here to find out
If it happened to him, then it could
Happen to all of them
Reed nods softly
Wait
You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic
Grow up, Johnny
You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
Is that a trick question
'mon, can't be the only one who thinks this is cool
Reed considers
But Sue cuts him short with a look
The elevator stops
-  - The elevator opens
They step out
They might be on the 20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor sixty
It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above -- Reed leads them into another area filled with separate "apartments" and all the amenities of home
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
This place is deluxe
You got cable

Let me show you to your rooms

No cameras flash
Victor tightens, and enters the building

She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a
She flips through it
It's filled with pictures of Reed and his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia globe
She stops at a picture of her and Reed in
noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to see
He smiles, standing at the door, watching her
God, 've been so worried about you
She notices the scar on his head
Victor, your scar -- told you, 'm fine
It's you 'm worried about
'm sorry  didn't get a chance to -- Please, no apologies
've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos
You'll have round-the clock care

But she stops him

Thank you, that's generous, but think  should stay here

Standoff
Made more tense by -- (

What are you doing here
They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand
'm starting to wonder the same thing
How much do you know about what happened to you
Not much
We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
Victor pauses
He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay
Well, let me know if there is anything can do
We're all in this together now
Victor shakes Reed's hand
His  is so tight that Reed's fingers
Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts her hand out
He smiles, and shakes
He heads off
Reed looks at his hand
Shakes his wrist
He looks at Victor
-  - Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger
Reed catches up
Victor wait
just wanted to say, 'm sorry the mission didn't go as planned -- Victor suddenly  on Reed
Lights flicker
Didn't go as planned
It was a catastrophe
You ruined the lives of four people -- ruined
With all due respect, told you to abort -- Abort
Reed,  put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and  will not let you make me look like a fool -- Victor, if we could understand what happened to us -- don't want to understand it
This isn't one of your science projects just want to fix it
Fast
Reed sees Victor's  maybe growing
Lights dim
(
) There a problem, Vic
They turn to see
down the hall, leaning in a doorway
Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body
No problem, Ben
He turns back to Reed
Close, quiet
Lights flicker
(') Just pay your goddamn electric bill, and get to work on a cure
Victor steps away, toward the elevator
He passes Ben, who just smiles and waves "goodbye
"  Before Victor's finger taps the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit responded to him)
Reed exhales, shaken
Victor steps into -- -  - The doors close, and Victor really

Well why didn't you say so
You want me to lift some weights or something
Reed shakes his head

No, just sit back
We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck
We need to find the source of your strength

Flames escape through the vents of the chamber

Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000 degrees Kelvin
They are essentially taking his temperature

Machines go haywire
His feet even start to    ,  a foot or two
He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter

His body steams
So does his temper
(') You're really cramping my style here
You were at 4000 Kelvin
Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- Sweet
That's the temperature of the sun
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
Gotcha
Okay
Supernova bad
Reed looks at the control panels
He cooked the equipment
Frustrated, Reed looks at the smoking system

He "sees" her through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature
He's having a hard time concentrating
He focuses on his work
It's not "invisibility" per se
You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field
That's what you projected on the Bridge

No boots, no gloves

You look like an eighties rock band

If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity -- (realizing) And reverse the mutations -- (talking more to himself) Curing countless diseases, not just ours

But we're the focus, right Reed
Reed
Of course
Of course

Ben gives a sad shake of his head

Then: He's working round the clock

All analysis, no action
Wasn't that the problem with you two
She holds tight, keeping cool
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us
Then why is Reed dragging his feet
Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass

You're finally the perfect woman for him

Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by one, furthest to closest
He looks around
Unnerved by the darkness
Hello

Victor steps out from shadows

Gave me a little shock
No hard feelings, right
Nothing personal
Victor says nothing
Ned keeps going

He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension

Smoke rises from his body

He remains scary calm
It's pronounced Latveria

Victor walks away, the final lights going to

He turns to the light switch, and the lights come on
He approaches his screens, and the monitors flicker to life
His powers are growing

Sir, is everything okay
What happened to your
Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed

He got what he wanted

he took from me
He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed

Victor's eyes narrow, zooming into

He zooms into key words: ,  , ,
And Victor gives a slow, thin smile
new plan forming
(') Now 'm going to take it back
Piece by bloody piece
His fist clenches
We hear
-   - Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal man could balance
But he is not normal
His arms are wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine
He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees
overseeing a group of
They are boxing up Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research
Victor wears a bandage, covering his scar
Reed eyes a glint of
Victor, are you
are you okay
Victor turns away
Don't worry about me
Worry about yourself
Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out
What are you doing here
What  should have done a long time ago
Applications and patents, Reed
This all belongs to me
Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box
But 'm not done with the machine -- Which is precisely the point
Analysis is over
It's time for action
My men could have mass- produced this by now
Reed shakes his head, defending himself
Mass-produced
This isn't a toaster
You have no idea how it works
Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the intricate  of the
He points to parts: Re-create the storm, invert the polarity here, reverse the mutation there
Don't talk to me like 'm some schoolboy
've got the same Phd you do
Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with his machine
He points to a   on the blueprint
The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill us
Victor slows
Is Reed getting to him
Or giving him ideas
(') Victor, please
We need time to verify the data
We can't afford any mistakes -- there's only enough ions for two or three attempts
Victor considers
He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle
Reed
'm not asking permission
(a final verdict) We'll build it, while you check the specs
Victor walks out
Reed looks unsure, as we   -- - The  slowly rise

They wear the  jackets
Reed watches, worried
Sue enters
She sees the shields, the technicians, the logo
And she is deeply worried
She steps over to Reed
Sparks fly behind them
Drills scream
Can  talk to you
- '  - Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed
Quiet, urgent: Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- He was going to take away all my data, equipment -- Better than your life
Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing
We are
Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool
Which is why 'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable -- Every variable but yourself

You can't live in your head like -- (finally losing it) 'm not the only one in there

Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst

So clear it out
Get out of your head
Get out of here
He looks at her, knowing what she means
Where she means
- Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street, mind tossing and turning
People stare, point and  run up to him
Mister, Mister
Please help me
My kitty is stuck in a tree
She gestures to a tree next to Ben
Looks up
(') Please save Miss Lucy
Ben rolls his eyes
Looks up
Considers climbing the tree, but thinks better of it
He has another idea
Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap out of it
The cat falls into frame
At the last instant, Ben sticks out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm
He hands the cat to the girl
Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks
He just moves on
- Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses of his bust
He stops, steps back to take a look
It's exquisitely rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the haunting anguish in his eyes
Ben is amazed, and touched, but
(under breath) Eyebrows are a little big
beat
He stares at these images of himself
(
) figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window
He turns to see
in the doorway
How'd you know it was me
'm blind, not deaf
Wanna come in
He steps toward her
But he sees
a  in the back part of the gallery
Ben pauses, a little insecure
'm not really dressed for a party
Relax, it's casual
No,  mean

dusty
She smiles, a thought forming, as we   -- -  - '  sprays a thin stream of water at Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin for his cracks
Intricate, intimate work
Ben enjoys every moment
He eyes a couple, large  in the corner
Those yours too
My step-dad's

was wondering when you'd walk by
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals
"Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship
" This ain't permanent
My friend Reed's working on a cure
think
She gets closer, running her hands across his arm
Bennie
You feel pretty good as is
Ben bristles
He doesn't want to stay this way
You don't know what it's like out there
Walking around like some kind of circus freak
People staring, whispering -- wouldn't know anything about that
mean
Tell me
When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know
(a beat) You went your own way then
You didn't listen to people
So why start now
As he ponders that, we hear a   on the   -- - Fans swarm
He signs autographs, poses for pictures
Then his eyes move to
an incredibly long stretch tinted window rolls down
Victor's face emerges
Need a ride, Johnny
/
- Johnny climbs in, sees
three impossibly gorgeous
few fans
Hope you don't mind
Gotta take care of the fans, right
He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them
Look,  built my business knowing what people want
And right now, the people want you
Johnny eyes the models, all lusting
And we don't want to let the people down now, do we
No we don't
Which is why we need to strike while the iron's hot
'm talking action figures, videogames, sponsors -- Videogames
You serious
Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook
(') You talk to Reed and Sue about this
Johnny
Let's be honest here
Ben, Reed, Sue
Good people, all
But stars
(shaking his head, a beat) don't want to break up the band, but you're the one they want
Don't you think it's time to go solo
Victor subtly nods to the models
They envelop Johnny
(') Take the car for a spin
Think about it
Is this the life you want
Or would you rather live in Reed's lab
The car stops
Victor gets out
He stands on the pavement
As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny
The door shuts, and
The windows all suddenly
- on the ceiling
drones about the galaxy
In the  , we find: Reed and Sue
Reed is thinking about work
could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage -- Reed
Shh
Just be quiet
And look up
He slowly looks up
The stars seem to calm him
(') Remember our first date here
God, was so nervous
You were
Of course  was
'd read all your papers on bioethics
Some of them two times just so 'd have something to say to you
Reed smiles softly, thinking back
You know,  bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
gave him twenty
They laugh
Sue looks up to the stars
Quiet: (') didn't want that night to end
Reed looks at her
Wrestles with a decision
Then quietly: Sue, you were right
It wasn't complicated
just wasn't ready to be
to become
(a beat) You can be a little intimidating
She knows
He trails off
Sue looks at him
(') You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you
speak his mind
One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted
did
did, Reed
but  wanted you to be that man
Someone  them
They slump down further
Closer
(') When  walked out,  waited ten minutes outside your door
Ten
Waiting for you to come find me
Why didn't you say something
That would have kinda defeated the purpose
And Reed
(closer, emotional) 'm saying it now
Their eyes lock
heated beat
No more secrets
Their faces are close
kiss is coming
Closer, closer
Sue disappears
(') (quiet, playful) Come find me
Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and
(
) (') That's my nose, genius
These are my lips
Reed's face is  on both sides by Sue's invisible hands
She pulls him into a
Lips touch
Soft, tender
Stars twinkle
And we slowly   -- - Ben and Alicia step out together
The crowd quiets, turns
few whispers flutter
Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips her arm into his
The party goes back to normal
Look around
'll get us drinks
They always let blind girls cut the line
She walks off
He watches her go
The way her hair moves
The lines of her neck
The light on her skin
This woman is the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen
He's falling hard
Ben steps through the crowd
The swanky guests give strained smiles, polite
Ben is starting to feel comfortable here
He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests
Ben hangs back, happy to watch her
few patrons pass him, thinking he's just an inanimate statue
don't know about this one
It lacks a certain
realism
Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia
He overhears two , who assume he's a statue
#1 She's always had a thing for runaways and strays, but this is ridiculous
#2 know
Did she really think these sculptures would sell
#1 Like anybody would want this thing in their house
That girl's a one-woman charity
Ben just stands there, frozen
His eyes dart around the room, paranoid now
Aware of people staring, laughing
He glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else
Ten seconds ago, this would have been dreamy
Now it's damning
We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging where she left Ben
She has a  of wine in hand for him
But Ben is gone
She looks disappointed, hearing his heavy  get softer and softer in the distance

About me
How sweet
Come on
Let me buy you something to eat
Looks like you could use the company

- Victor and Ben sit in a window booth
waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared
Victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at Ben
Ben burps: it rattles the plates
'Scuse me
know it can't be easy
Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny
At least they can go out in public
But for you
People staring
Whispering behind your back
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job -- 'm just saying,  know what it's like to lose something you love
To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back
The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth
Reed's gonna fix me up -- For your sake  hope you're right
'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
Skeptical
Ben doesn't trust him
But Victor is hitting pressure points
Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can
You're his best friend
So what possible reason could he have for taking his time
(a beat) mean, other than getting close to Sue
Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted
He can't help but find truth in the words
And we   -- -   - Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close
Reed turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see
He sits waiting, scowling
They stop laughing immediately
Yeah,  have that effect on people
The construction of the   is complete
The Technicians are gone now
Ben -- Oh, you remember my name do you
You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body
We're working as hard as we can -- Yeah
can tell
Victor was right
He motions to Reed and Sue together
Come on, this is nothing
Sue looks a little hurt
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work
Ben,  don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse

Look at me
He grabs Reed's face, his fingers  the skin
He Reed back
Reed slams down to the ground

That's why  can't make a mistake
've got to get it right, and it's not right yet
We need to test this
Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed

For what
So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while 'm the freak of the week
Reed tries to stand, but Ben  him back
Reed slams into the wall, and stays down this time
Ben
Stop it
Or 'll stop it
She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields
Stay out of this Susie
As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to  Ben up like a python
They struggle
Ben runs back into a wall to shake Reed
Their faces are close, heated
(') Good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back
'Cause you're on your own now
Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go
Ben walks out
Sue comes to Reed's side
He's bleeding

Just go, go after him
Stop him
She heads out
Reed slowly stands
He looks at the transformation machine
It's not ready
But
Reed steps toward it
As he walks, his image goes grainy in -- '  - Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every step
This is what Victor has been waiting for
His screens flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull back
He sees:

He sees Johnny coming in
Christmas come early
Check it out
He holds up an   of : a horribly bloated body topped by a tiny pinhead
Johnny pushes a button and -- ' '
, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall
With his other hand, Ben grabs the toy and  it into the wall, inches from Johnny's head
The toy lodges into the plaster
Hey
That's a prototype
Go back to the drawing board
He strides away
-   - Sue speeds out of the elevator
No sign of Ben
She runs into
who shakes off the encounter
Johnny
Did you see Ben
Yeah, for the last time,  hope
'm done with this freak show
'm moving back to the real world
Is that what you call it
"Real"
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project
This hits home
Sue is quiet
Johnny turns to go
Johnny, slow down
Think
You know mom didn't raise us to -- Look around, sis
She's not here
So you can stop talking to me like 'm your little boy -- As soon as you stop acting like one
Come on, you're smarter than this
You think those people out there care about you
You're just a fad to them
He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door
Let's try something new: you live your life
And 'll live mine

Bar tricks and stealing chicks
Johnny does one more trick
taps the guy's drink
igniting it into a burst of flame
The Boyfriend drops the glass, which  on the ground
catches the floor on fire
The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out
What are you doing
You could have burned somebody
The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk off
She turns back for one last comment

The couple leaves
Johnny glances around

He sees how quickly they can turn
The crowd parts slightly
He looks very alone

The ominous chamber sits with its door open
Victor enters from the control station
Ben, come in
What is this
Where's Reed
Where do you think
With Sue
Ben looks at the flickering lights
Suspicious
Victor turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark room
(') (quiet) 'll take it from here, Leonard
Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here
Yes sir
Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben
What do you want, Vic
To help you
've run every test known to man
And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready
Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but
Reed said it'd be weeks till -- He also said we'd avoid that storm in space
And we know how that turned out
Ben nods
Reed was wrong before
Ben gets closer to the machine, drawn to it
He wants to believe, so badly
(') He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass
Yet another mistake for "Mr
Fantastic

Power it up
Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little around him

Ben keeps his eyes on the machine
His dream is alive
Let's do it

Thing enters
He looks around this sterile box
An animal in a cage
Victor pushes a control; the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal
Thing shuts his eyes
He just wants to be Ben again
: Victor initiates the transformation sequence
As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in the lab
Energy pumps into the chamber
The storm swirls faster
Lights flicker
there's not enough power, until -- -- Victor walks over
grabs hold of the machine with both hands
and
countdown begins in the control panels
on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window
The chamber activates
The storm strikes hard
The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony
Struggling violently inside
To escape
Extend the moment: Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes
- The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie glow
Suddenly, a   emerges from the window of the Baxter Building
The rest of the city lights dim slightly

The chamber rattles dangerously, as the power seems to  the very foundation of the building
And then it's over
The light dies down

It still pulses along with the chamber

And
steps out
Not The Thing
No more rocks

Now 've got an unlimited supply

Dead serious: Where is Reed

She tries to stay calm
What has he done to you
Reed's eyes shift to see
Doom emerge from the darkness
(
) How romantic
Victor, please -- It's Doctor Doom to you
He steps closer
Electrodes course over his metal skin
We know the machine works
It worked on Ben, it'll work on you
We can turn you back -- Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts
She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her
Victor
You always thought you were god
Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast
Sue please, let's not fight
No, Victor
Let's

But he simply shakes it off, and steps up
Too powerful

She lays there, beaten, visible
In the distance behind Doom, city lights , fading in and out
Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through the machine)
Reed looks up
Could it be
- Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him
He's running out of options, when he spots: floating in the water ahead
Thinking fast, Johnny does a fly-by and  a fireball at the barge
The flames ignite and spread quickly
He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him
Fifteen feet

Just as it's about to hit -- and falls toward the water
As he tumbles through the air, we    -- - From their vantage point, they see the missile explode
Flames dance
Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck
Reed tries desperately to move, but he is
It takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes a  sound
One more down
Now it's just the scientist and his specimen
Sue and Reed lock eyes
Reed tries to move his mouth
He has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips and get the words out
Sue
The only thing  ever knew without thinking was
(his lips fully freezing) love
He starts to say "you," but his lips , mid-word
Sue whispers to him: Me too, Reed
Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow

It's my time now
An elevator

Reed recognizes the voice
So do we

Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting the tubes from Reed

Just "a little larger than life"
Maybe you'll listen to me next time before -- The  shifts
