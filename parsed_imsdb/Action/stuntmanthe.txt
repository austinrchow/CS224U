Marcus Adaptation by Richard Rush From the novel by Paul Brodeur -1- : 1
- strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest
There is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway
few 14- are scattered across the big dusty parking lot
Morning sunlight glints off their chrome stacks
It bakes the asphalt and warms the mangy hides of stray  asleep in the dirt
hovers about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird
It's the beginning of a perfect day
highway   slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and parks beside the slat and shingled building
are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge
2      - High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps to work, their bodies forming a "
" One of them suddenly turns, pointing at a nearby treetop
Lookee there
He grabs a   from his belt, cocks his arm and hurls it across the open stretch
It lands smack in the middle of the tree
rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a comes flapping out
The lineman cackles over his marksmanship
3        - The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky, flapping for its life and suddenly
It crashes head-on into 3A   the bubble of the passing
4 The ship rocks as the  wrestles the controls
There are in the cabin
The man beside the pilot,  , is sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple
He glances up in irritation
Hey, will you stop wiggling
-2- Don't yell at me
yell at the goddamn crazy bird
It tried to kill us
(back to his manuscript) Oh yeah, that's your story
What's the bird got to say about it
Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful    He tosses it out the hatch
5
- The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch and falls on the slanted roof of the   beneath
It rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked Highway Patrol car
6 Something hit the roof
So will the Chief
if we don't grab this guy Cameron
They climb out as we see a    sliding up behind them
emerge from the second car
7
- They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance
As they pass an open  the
serves behind the long counter where  on stools eat watching the overhead
There is a   in action
The policemen are seen  b
g
ambles up and straddles a stool
Gettin' hot early
It's gonna be a scorcher
The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher, then move down the counter
-3- 9 He sits a few stools away
He's about 25, even-featured, bone- weary
His appealing face needs a shave
The cook fills his water glass
The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles
His eyes are riveted on the policemen
10   ' Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one policeman moves to a  , another stands near the looking at a magazine
They seem nonchalant, but are placed to block all avenues of escape
11 Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm
He whirls to face the man beside him
That's really a beaut
really a beaut
The  is staring at the  which shows below the rolled-up sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate scrollwork and a patriotic slogan
The man pulls up his own sleeve to show a small tatoo of an anchor
(') My wife still yells about this
but yours -- that's some eagle
like a billboard
(eyes on police) Yeah, that's the grand old bird
(a half-smile) Right now  just wish the son-of-a- bitch could fly
Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine
12 The  wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the balls
-4- Hey Morton, you think your ass is connected to the machine
You wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go where you want
12A   Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the  above the counter
On it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as ) bending over a bowl of dog food
Her ass, too, 12B   wiggles engagingly
The pinball player leaves the machine
Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks closer; like the cat to the mouse hole
Hey, you're lucky
Somebody left a free ball
Uh huh
Cameron shoots
The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights and buzzers flashing
Another policeman approaches
You got 20,000
You're gonna win
Win what
free game
Terrific
He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about
Escape seems hopeless
(') that's just what  needed
one more chance to lose
In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over Cameron's wrists, snapping the  on
The trap has sprung
13 Cameron nods his head in resignation
big uncontrollable grin breaks and spreads over the cop's face
-5- Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for the back door
He flings it open
The cops are moving toward him
One has almost got his gun out
Cameron
Halt
'll shoot
Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the screen door still blocks his path
He tears through it, but gets stuck halfway
(panicked) No
God, don't shoot
Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he breaks free and runs
14 As Cameron flies down the back steps, a  stationed at the rear door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his back
Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences, between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the other side
Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot
15
-     - As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not alien to him
He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen cones
Sweat pours down his face
His breath rasps in his throat
He breaks into a clearing and
suddenly face to face with a who crouches, blocking his path
It is one of the telephone linemen we saw earlier
16 The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron
The other lineman is halfway up the power pole
They both stare at Cameron's handcuffs
Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked
The man on the ground grabs a  and moves forward with the same gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree
Stand right there like a good old boy and do what  say
You wanna try and mess with me, you've had fair warning
was a combat Marine in Korea
Okay
-6- The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away
Korea
No shit, so was my old man
(he suddenly stamps his foot and shrieks) Aaaaaaaargh
The lineman jumps in surprise
Then, enraged like a startled bull, he lunges forward with the wrench
Cameron uses the man's weight against him, his moves those of a trained fighter
hard knee to his stomach doubles up the lineman
The handcuffed arms slam down like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground
kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out
The other lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one step back up
Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed grasp and dashes off into the forest
17     - He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds his head and drinks
the terrain
There are no pursuers, the forest is silent
18     - The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting the cuffs around Cameron's wrists
He lifts his knee from the cutter handle
His arms are now free
He wedges a chisel against one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it
We hear his sharp outcry
19 Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain
The bracelet is still intact
He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above
20
- Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the mountainous pass
He crosses a bridge
Through the arches of its low stone railing, he sees a   twenty feet below rushing toward the sea
Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert
-7- 21   ' In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him
22 He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from this hidden vantage
23 The speck grows larger
The  of the engine is faintly audible now
Sunlight flashes from metal and glass
Cameron's apprehension suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as he had feared, but something else
Moving in the shimmering heat wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War  vintage with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him
24 He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride
The Duesenberg roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust
Suddenly there is a screech of brakes
25 The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop
Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and climbs in beside the
26 Thanks
thought you didn't see me
The driver, , is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and deeply agitated
Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he talks half to Cameron, half to himself
Damn it
Screwed it up
Lost my nerve
Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his nostril
-8- (') Goddamn sinuses
Can't even see straight
Cameron looks at him, puzzled
You want me to drive
Burt whirls on him, enraged
What the hell is that supposed to mean
(confused) No offense
thought you might
Every one of you jerks is a goddamn hotshot expert
Thanks for the vote of confidence
If you think you can do any better, just come and try it
He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard
27 Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the momentum
Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows
Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred- eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron
28 - Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond
-9- 29      - Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down
His hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways
The big spinning tires brush him as they pass
We catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield
As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed, expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence
He opens his eyes, climbs to his feet
The road is empty
The Duesenberg is gone
Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off
There is nothing below but the rushing black water
Here and there bubbles swirl to the surface
They could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current
30 His thoughts racing
Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole thing
Suddenly a  appears, hovering, almost at eye level
Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe
31 It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence
It has swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing, catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide
Can be seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away
The man beside the  is
He grabs the radio microphone and begins speaking into it
Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a field
The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water, hovers
Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks, away from the road
32    - Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a barreling toward the sight of the accident
In the back, are frantically putting on black wet-suits
They look, from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each other
Cameron runs on
- 10 - 33
- few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround a sandy cove beyond which is the sea
There is a fishing pier, boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with sunbathing
The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow , which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the sandy cove
Cameron appears on the bluff
34 Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours
He reaches down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear
He pulls off his worn boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the town below
There are crowds to get lost in down there
He unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his wrist
Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet against it
It won't open
Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward the town
35 The  is yellow and on it are the words: '
' and we realize the words are on the back of a that jiggles as its wearer walks
It is Cameron
Beyond him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with the sun
Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis
The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors, whom Cameron deftly avoids
Then, he looks up at the sky, perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling
Cameron watches it warily as he walks
35A has formed at the railing of the pier
Many of the people with   at the sand below
Cameron notices the helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open cockpit
It is a     with
35B Cameron works his way through the crowd
All eyes now look upward at the plane
is  coming through an electric - 11 - All right, people
Quiet
We're losing the sun
This is a take
You're welcome to watch, but please, no flashbulbs
They'll spoil the shot
Cameron's world has become more ordered again
It's a film company shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg
His eyes go to the scene below
36 suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane is  the surf where  in German  uniforms unload ashore
The bright little plane has started a lazy dive toward the soldiers, its engine whining
From here it looks as fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron
37 As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous explosion
In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats, ammunition and people are blown sky-high
The smoke from the exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene
38 The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their pleasure turns to horror and disbelief
39 As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a horrifying reality
Bodies are scattered about
One man has been severed in half, drenched in blood
Chunks of meat, arms and legs litter the beach
40 Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe
(shouting) Something went wrong
Then, people begin to moan and scream
- 12 - 41 Staring tensely at the carnage
By reflex, a shout escapes his lips
Medic
Get the medics
41A     sags into a faint
small child in the crowd is crying and clutching Cameron's leg
42 As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn
(
) Cut
said
That's a print
Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human beings before our eyes once again
43 The crowd reacts in various ways
Sighs of relief, laughter, anger
The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their trouser legs
(yelling) Beautiful, Harvey
You gave everybody a heart attack
, the Second Unit Director, yells back
Eli will hate it
He said he wanted the shot in one
Now watch, he'll do six hours of pick-ups
The crowd disperses
turns to Cameron
Great
but why do they always use so much blood
It ruins the realism, don't you think
- 13 - (still shaken, quietly mutters) asshole
The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn by the beating sound of the helicopter
He glances up
44   ' The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a landing site
45 Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away from the landing site
Suddenly he stops short, caught by something he sees
Excitedly he points and begins to shout
Hey
Hey you
46   ' Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man in the Duesenberg
Hearing the shout, the actor stops and tentatively turns
It's a mistake
Clearly the features are different
It's not Burt
47 Cameron is puzzled
He watches as the red-haired actor looks about to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by a    holding a parasol and offering her autograph book
Mr
Bailey
Aren't you Raymond Bailey, the actor
Would you please sign your autograph
Write 'to Emily
for eternal peace
' Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a million times
He has those special rugged good looks that belong to Marlboro men and movie stars
- 14 - (') 'm certainly glad you're all right
lost my husband and my son in the wars
The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers for a landing
The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads for the landing site
48 As it touches the ground and its doors fly open
Out step the and
The   rushes up and shouts over the hissing blades of the idling chopper
What happened on the bridge
(deeply upset) All the divers found in the car was the goddamn camera
(stunned) And Burt
(anguished) No Burt
All gone
caught in the current probably and
they're diving downstream and searching the riverbanks, but
don't say anything to the crew yet
(softly) Jesus Christ
Yeah, Jesus Christ
What do you want to do
- 15 - don't know
call my mother and have her tell me it wasn't my fault
(desperately) What the hell could have happened
Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly rises
The sudden  from its blades blows some screening off a pile of equipment
It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been approaching Eli and topples her into the surf
She is trapped in a tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats
Before she can regain her balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea
49 Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched this mini-disaster
The undertow from the wave has swept the Old Lady directly beneath him
Reaching down toward her, he yells: Hey
Hey, give me your hand
He can't quite reach her
As a last resort, he drops off the edge into the water by her side
50 He grabs for the struggling Old Lady
Don't be afraid
You're gonna be okay
Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts, grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water
She is choking, gasping for air
She turns her face toward him
51   ' Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away
She frees her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the on which is the melting putty and make up
With it goes her wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl
- 16 - My God
(choking on water) You're
know you
that girl from the actress
Nina
(sputtering) Franklin
The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face, ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to that kind of "movie star" beauty
It's something Cameron feels in the pit of his stomach
My God
Why the hell
(laughing and choking) Makeup test
it's for the film
Regaining his composure enough to attempt flattery, but he means it
They gotta be crazy to cover that face
(laughing) 'm only old at the end of the story
As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any reason to hold her
He starts to put her down
No, don't do that
Rescue me
In three feet of water
Oh come on, please
always wanted someone to rescue me from something
Grinning, he carries her toward shore
- 17 - Eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at the water's edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down
Nina
You damned near scared me to death
At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry
Oh hell, it's all ruined now and wanted you to see the makeup, Eli
Where were you
even got Raymond's autograph and he didn't know
You'd have been proud
Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking pictures, all shouting at once
The  closes in, excluding Cameron to the outskirts
(to the
) Get her into a tub, then bed
and want to see her in makeup and costume again before dinner
hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for Cameron
then spots him
Hey
Thank you
That was really gallant
rescuing an old lady
Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away
53 He moves toward Cameron
Wait a second
want to thank you, too
As Eli trots up, Cameron tenses, finally facing this man who saw him from the helicopter
(') - 18 - Don't run away
What is that, a habit with you
Yeah,  also smoke too much
You and Burt on the bridge
how about telling me what happened
Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support the pier
Cameron hesitates, but Eli's manner compels him to follow
don't know
He must've gone crazy
He tried to run me down
Oh
Why would he do that
(flustered) didn't ask him why
All  know is he was comin' at me very fast
(quoting an axiom spouted by top sergeants in a thousand boot camps) 'You want to get home for Thanksgiving, you better figure the guy comin' at you is tryin' to kill you'
That's one thing  learned from the gooks
Gooks
That has a nostalgic ring
They have reached the pier
Eli stops, he is watching something (') You guys really used to call them gooks
thought that was just Time Magazine
- 19 - That was 'Nam
What should  call 'em,
Nobody'd known what was talkin' about
He turns to follow Eli's gaze
54   '  - has driven onto the beach
From it, have emerged
They are armed and efficient looking
The moves to greet them
Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt)
, the Chief, is irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance
All right, this time you've had it
Where is he
Chief, 'm glad you dropped by
Eli says you gotta do something about all these people on the beach
(bellowing) Thirty minutes is what you've got to get your goddamn equipment off this beach and out of town
You tell Eli Cross if your men are on the streets after four o'clock, 'll throw their ass in jail
55 Eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling, smiling up at Cameron
Speaking of jail
would you get upset if  asked how many cops were after you
(suddenly grim) What are ya talkin' about
- 20 - (off-hand) Your
bracelet
the look on your face
the way you ran from the bridge
(with exaggerated delicacy) don't suppose you want to tell me what you did
Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him
No
don't
(brightly, with humor) Could  try categories
Cameron half laughs despite himself
(') (glancing
) Ever done any stunt work
What
How'd you like to be a stunt man
You look like you're in pretty good shape, fast on your feet
You could do it
(getting to his feet) Besides, You're not gonna have much choice
Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the Production Manager
Eli puts his hand on Cameron's shoulder and steps out into the sunlight
(softly, to Cameron) Now, don't get hasty
And, remember your ass, it's just like mine
maybe  can save them both
- 21 - (trailing after Jake) but we've gotta have three days to finish this picture
(striding toward Eli) You said you'd be gone four days ago, before the season started
You lie, break promises
(he is now close enough and shouting at Eli) Cross, 've gone out of my way, but this time
beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and leaving him sputtering
As it departs, Eli seizes the moment
Jake, it's been a rotten morning
You're hot and tired
Let's go in, have us a drink and find out what's eating you
(turning beet red) Don't treat me like these other morons
You know goddamn well what's eating me is that Duesenberg on the bottom of the river with the dead man in it
There is silence
Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his toe
Then Jake starts shouting again
(') mean, that is a goddamn public bridge and a public river
You go there without permits, without any precautions and get a man killed
(gently) Jake
No more bullshit explanations
Just go
before  figure out how to hang you with a manslaughter charge
- 22 - (after a pause; quietly) No explanations
don't have any
But, maybe he does
(staring at Cameron) Go ahead, ask him, Jake
Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality
(wide-eyed) Now wait
You're not blaming me for
(wheeling on Cameron) Why not, Burt
Because you're a fake
Because you're just a goddamn daredevil with a head full of marbles
Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this madness
Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately
(') He grabs the bread, blows the shot, screws you up
screws me up
He's dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't dead yet
So do me a favor, put your handcuffs on this son-of-a- bitch and put him some place where he can't get hurt
The Chief is dazed
If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously alive
Jake goes to Cameron
How did you get out of the car
He didn't get out
Our divers got him out
and brought him back in the chopper
The Chief stares at Cameron
His clothes and hair are wet
There is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the Duesenberg
He looks the part
Jake turns to Eli with resignation
- 23 - Cross, when these three days are up, 'm going to arm my men with shotguns and tell them it's open season on any fruit carrying a camera
He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by  snapping pictures
He glares at them, angry at the world
Eli puts his arm on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd toward the hotel
Eli is now easygoing and friendly
You did that very well
didn't get a chance to say a word
just listened
There are only a few actors in the world who have mastered that art
Anyway, it was a good audition
You landed the part
How
What about the crew
They going to look at me and say, 'Hi, Burt
' Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth
' Don't worry about my crew, they'll call you anything  want 'em to
Look, 'm not being callous
Burt is a fucking tragedy, but there's nothing in the world  can do about it
've gotta have this location for three more days
and you need a place to hide
They have reached the steps of the
has stopped in front
are piling out
The   pulls up and parks nearby
Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd
(shouting in b
g
) Eli
The crew's waiting
We need the next setup
- 24 - The hand
Close-up of the hand
Be there in a minute
An Eli minute or a real minute
Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps
By tomorrow the local cops'll know what  look like
can't hang around
(expansively) "Burt," stop worrying
Haven't you heard of "movie magic
" (pointing to the etched glass doors of the hotel) That door is "the looking glass," and inside
is Wonderland
You're gonna pose as a stunt man, who's posing as an actor, who's posing as a character in a movie
who's posing as an enemy soldier
In that big a crowd, who's gonna notice you
People like to believe in things and cops are just people
The have reached the front door
Eli holds it open for Cameron
(with mock confidentiality) Frankly, your problem's so simple, it's almost beneath me
Have faith, 'Alice
' Close your eyes and enjoy
In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his eyes
' Open your eyes
and don't touch
It's wet
- 25 - 56
-   ' His eyes open
He stares at his face in the mirror, pleased at the subtle transformation
His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red, somehow changing his whole aspect
He rubs the red mark on his wrists where the bracelet has been removed
56A Part of the laundry room is being used for the film's Hairdressing Department
Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron, surrounded by dryers, wigs, etc
In b
g
, washing machines churn constantly
, the Hairdresser, an attractive earthy woman of thirty-two, stands over him
He is still wary and trying not to show it
(looking in mirror) Could be worse
could be green
think  like it
Of course you like it
ask anybody
Denise gives great hair
Got any grass
(shaking his head) Nope
She touches his hair to test the dryness, holding her hand there for a moment longer than seems necessary
He grins at her, rises and crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look
What else don't you have that need
She moves to a basement window and gazes out
57     - Through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while Eli rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star,  , (who Cameron earlier saw on the beach)
Bailey is dressed as a World War  British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era
' Our male star isn't going to like you
- 26 - - (moving toward window) Why not
You're too good looking
His idea of a perfect stunt double is two- hundreds pounds of hamburger in a red wig
He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina
What's she like
've seen her on (irritated by his interest in Nina) At selling douche powder, she's fabulous; dog food
'm not sure she's sincere
What are you sore about
'm not sore
Isn't that what you wanted to know
(with sarcasm) Or did you mean, what's the real Nina Franklin like--without the greasepaint and tinsel
Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around with the toe of her shoe
(') You mean, what's she like -- underneath
Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of (Nina's) lace panties
He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade
- 27 - (') (moving toward him) What do those say about the girl who wears them
Shy
Delicate
Sensitive
She reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile with Cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on his, amusement on hers
(') (touching his hair) Still wet
very wet
Cameron is trying to remember: what was it Eli said
"Close your eyes, relax and enjoy
" Across the room the washing machines churn, whirl and heave
59 Eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick-up" shot for the explosion sequence we saw earlier
Eli and , the cameraman, are lying beside the camera
Before them, the "severed" arm protrudes from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight
You sure he can breathe
(a mumbling assent from beneath the sand) Where's Raymond
(Raymond kneels beside him) Remember, you just crashed
you were wandering the beach behind the German lines looking for a place to hide when you saw the explosion
You're stunned by the carnage
That bomb was dropped by a guy in your squadron
Okay
Roll the film
60 Through the ,   the 'arm' protruding from the sand
We o
s
yelling: "Turning"
"speed"
"action
" We see the fingers begin to move spasmodically
Eli's voice yells: "Okay, Raymond
" Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and bigger
like a rubber glove filling with air
then
The (balloon-covered) fingers
- 28 - 61 Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including Eli
Gabe is patting Eli's face, Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately as one would a pet dog's
(cackling) Gotcha that time
Didn't we
(through his laughter) Yeah, you got me another half-hour behind
Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides
Cameron, now wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the sidelines
(gently, grinning) Thought the chief could use a little cheering up today
(turning quiet and serious) So you heard the news about Burt
(nodding) Any more word
(bitterly) Afraid not
there's no picture ever made that's worth it
(shaking his head) 'll never understand why these guys do it -- take the chances
- 29 - (thoughtfully) Don't know
Trying to beat the system,  guess
we all know that some day we're gonna die of nothing more important than wrinkles
and that makes us so scared and crazy, we'll do anything
Go off bridges
fight windmills
wars
anything
There is great sadness among them
Eli breaks the mood lightly
(') That's what our film's about -- or didn't you know
(sees Cameron) Hey, Burt, come over here
Cameron crosses to them
He and Raymond stand appraising each other, red-haired men in identical uniforms
As Raymond offers his hand: (to Eli) My new cock and balls
(quickly) Not new
It's important not to let that get around as yet
So, for the time being, let's make like he's the same guy
(adding a touch of color) But no longer known as "Bad-assed Burt
" Ever since his 'fortunate rescue,'
we call him "Lucky
" 62
-    - is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film
trots up and presents a receipt book
Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently
Your film from that camera in the Duesenberg's on the way to the lab
Put it on the plane with my own little hands
- 30 - When do we get it back
Don't know
Stamped it "rush
" If  stamp "rush" on my mare's ass, she'll still take eleven months to foal
Call the lab and find out when
(quietly) lost a man today
wanna see that footage and find out why
As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands waiting, circles around him, sizing him up
Cameron is no longer wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt
Done any stunt work
Not really
Not really
You have or you haven't
(good-naturedly) got out of Vietnam in one piece
Let me tell you that wasn't a bad stunt
(skeptically) That's ancient history
Seems like yesterday
(pointing at church steeple) Could you jump from that tower to the that roof
- 31 - 63      ( ) Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the   and the roof of the nearby
He unconsciously grimaces at the four-story drop between them
(being glib) Once, to save my ass,  jumped out of a banana tree into an oxcart full of buffalo shit
Does that count
We'll see
Put these on
He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in the churchyard
(puzzled by the pads) Where do they go
(tapping his knee) Under the pants
(pointing to lines he has drawn) want you to jump from here
to there
Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet
Okie-dokie
Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for approval
Very good
Except you're dead
Your brains are scattered all over the goddamn pavement
You landed on the edge and fell backwards four stories
Where do we send the body
- 32 - (returns to the starting line) Don't bury me yet
He takes a running start and leaps hard
While he's still in mid- air, Chuck yells
You're still dead
You fell over the other side of the building
Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit shaken
(') You wanna try it right, once
You should land in a tuck-and-roll
Show me, sergeant
Chuck launches himself head-first
His hands touch the ground just beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder roll, he somersaults to his feet
Very fancy
He takes a running start and does the same
Not quite as well, but well enough
As he rolls to his feet: Okay
Better
My speciality is Hopscotch
Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting
- 33 - And Burt's specialty was drowning
You know one goddamn daredevil on this picture was enough
What the hell was Eli thinking, giving me a smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when need a stunt man
It's a little different running across that roof when they're pumping tracer bullets over your head
(eloquently pleading his case) was running for twenty-six months with guys shooting at me
not over my head
at my head and 'm alive
knew daredevils
got nothing against them
it's just they're all dead
So ease off and give me a chance
Cameron is surprised to see that Chuck is grinning
(') (genuinely) Hey, were you putting me on
Me
wouldn't know how to do that
Chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at Cameron
64
-    - (pained) Can you imaging Eli doing a World War  picture without horses
Do you know the gags  could do with four runaway horses pulling a caisson
Cameron sailing into the
Chuck ducks slightly, catching Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault
Cameron lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building
Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak
The church steeple can be seen in b
g
(and we now realize time has passed and we are no longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the building)
- 34 - (') Next time hit me higher
(climbing to his feet) What's Eli got against horses love horses
Don't butter me up
Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his shoulder
Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat
Cameron scrambles to follow
(as he walks) We'll draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here, while you're rolling
Now there's nothing very difficult
But this is where you gotta think
Your mind can't be on snatch
It's gotta be on grabbing that gutter
They have reached the lower edge of the roof
Cameron looks down at the drop
Or my brains are all over the pavement again, right
(walking away) You know a good falling horse makes more money in four minutes than a bank president does in a year
Picture's not over
Maybe you'll still get your chance
Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the crew is setting up a shot in a room below
(sadly) Naw, all they care about is story
64A - 35 - They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a They gaze down at a   two stories below that juts from the side of the building-wing across the court
(') Now here's where the scuffle ends
When the pipe breaks loose, you fall and hit that awning
Then Eli yells "cut" and old Raymond takes your place for the close-ups and the glory
That's where the German soldiers catch him and throw him in the nuthouse
They're shootin' that scene downstairs now
(staring at awning) That's supposed to hold me
Probably doesn't hold rain
It's not a real awning, it's a catcher
65
-    - Cameron's face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from the growing strain of some physical effort
' It's no harder up here than it is on the ground
to reveal Cameron dangling from a section of rain gutter, four stories above the ground
'  (') It's the same gag
it's just a little scarier
And that's what you get paid for
(alert) Yeah, how much
You're stealing candy with this gag
You get six hundred bucks
(almost falling) - 36 - Jesus
Christ
Watch it, will ya
(helping Cameron onto roof) What did you think a stunt man is
He's a professional
If the camera jams, that's another six hundred and if Eli says "try it again," six hundred more
(exultantly) Yahooo
Six-fucking-hundred-bucks
66
- In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in a World War  military asylum
In it, Eli's crew is filming a sequence -- a dozen enraged  in tatters, heads shaven, wild- eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of Cameron's exultant yell)
67 Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated derelicts suddenly swarm over him
One, like a mad dog, goes fro his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club
Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams
Get away
For an instant, the inmates stop in stunned silence -- broken only by a distant shout overhead
' (on the roof overhead) Six-fucking-hundred, gorgeous, beautiful dollars
can't believe it
The slavering madmen look up, then out at the camera, madmen no longer, simply bewildered actors
' All right
Hold it
Hold it
68 - 37 - Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene
He is waving for order
Save it, everybody
(storming in) Jesus Christ, what the hell was that
Somebody get their ass up on that roof
(cutting him off) Never mind
didn't like it anyway
As Eli steps down from the , a solemn, quiet man approaches him from among the onlookers
It is   (the writer)
What's wrong
The scene's wrong
(yells to the
) Call a break
The
Calls "Five minutes" and the crew moves toward the coffee urn
Eli wanders toward the door, Sam pursuing
(fighting for his scene) Eli, it played like a dream
My God, it was Marat-Sade
(glumly) It played like shit
- 38 - (desperate) Well, who was that on the phone in the middle of the night when you first read it, raving about the magical madhouse scene, the upstairs maid
Eli rips the page with the "madhouse scene" from his screenplay as they stride out of the building
69 There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby
He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane
Behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the Production Manager, , half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum, all looking concerned
Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli, squatting beside him on the sand pile
What do you wanna do, Eli
They're all waiting
While Sam talks, Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sam's shoe
Suddenly noticing, Sam yanks his foot away
(') (irritated) Being childish isn't going to help your movie
You know, there's nothing wrong with the story
(removing his shoe and shaking the sand out) The real problem is since  wrote this thing two years ago, you've had Watergate, the energy crisis, Women's Lib, the economy is down the tubes
You want to talk about burning issues
There's arsenic in the glue on the back of food stamps
That's why you don't like the "madhouse scene
" Your goddamn war story has lost its relevance
Don't be negative, Sam
We can start a new one in time for the preview
- 39 - Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand into Sam's other shoe
Cut it out, will ya
70
- Eli is at the head of a long table,      a dozen members of the company dining with him
Nina sits beside Eli listening with rapt attention to Sam's monologue, her dessert fork sensuously lingers at her lip
Two years ago you were all charged up to make a great big anti-war statement and they wouldn't let you
Now they let you, but you haven't got a war
What you've got is egg on your face because Vietnam's long gone and it's too late
Our picture's not about fighting wars
Oh
It's about fighting windmills
The truth in Eli's statement registers on Sam
Cameron sits farther down the table, watching Nina watch Eli
and wishing she were watching him
War isn't the disease
It's only one of the symptoms
(hooked) What's the disease
- 40 - That's the big question, Sam
Name the disease and you've licked the screenplay
(indicating Cameron) Ask him
'Cause he knows what the film is about
Right Lucky
Tell 'em
How'd you like Vietnam
How'd you like bubonic plague
You drafted
No
See, Sam
Here's another one who hates war
but he enlisted
(to Cameron) You fought in Vietnam for two years
mean actually were out there killing people
Hey,  didn't kill that many people
Don't be modest, Lucky
Everybody digs a little violence
What was that you said on the beach
Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with Nina watching
About what
About getting home for Thanksgiving
(tentatively) that you better figure the guy coming at you is trying to kill you
- 41 - Yeah
See, Sam
That's what the disease is about
being scared shitless
Inventing enemies
Whistling in the dark
wish you'd talk to the kid, Sam,  mean it
You know, really, you guys should room together
(getting the last word) Hey, Lucky, give me your cot by the window and 'll let you read a great madhouse sequence
They all laugh
(surrendering) All right, Eli
'll write you another scene
What difference does it make
The studio will cut it all out anyway and what you got left is a lot of swell battle scenes, which, when  was back there they said were "just terrific
" (simply) No, they won't
Yeah, what makes you different
(quietly) Because they know if they cut my picture, 'll kill 'em
The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is suddenly an awkward silence at the table
Cameron eyes Eli with a wry smile
You mean, bang
Kill 'em, just like that
- 42 - (matter of fact) No
'll kill 'em and eat 'em hate to waste anything
(laughs) They call him "Eli the Terrible
" Sam, my picture is the only kid 've got
If the studio said your daughter, Jennifer, would look better with her fingers chopped off, what would you do
Being an insecure writer, 'd call my agent
and get another opinion
Everyone laughs
Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the table
Cameron spots him and starts to rise
If you'll excuse me
(arriving) Don't go away, Burt
want you
(broad welcome) Jake
Long time, no see
You taken care of my problem with the beach
'm not talking to you
(to Production Manager) understand you got that film out of the Duesenberg
(cutting in) It's at the lab, Jake
- 43 - 'm talking to this gentleman
(to Production Manager) We want to see it
Cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as Eli says
Tell the Chief it's our pleasure
Soon as it gets back
but ask him why
(choked up with its importance) You can tell your Mr
Cross this inquiry comes from a source so high it is not his to question
(now at a loss for proper words) it is his to do it, or else
Someone they're looking for may have been on that road when the car went off
(to Cameron) Burt, you see anybody
Then, suddenly noticing something different about Cameron's appearance
(') Hey, did you have red hair before
(indicating Denise) She sprays it every day so  look like Raymond
didn't see a soul
(to the rescue) Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy being brilliant, he wouldn't have noticed Jesus Christ walking on the water
Jake pulls a  from a manila envelope and hands it to Cameron
71 - 44 - wire photo, front and side views of Cameron, taken at his military induction
War ages a man
he looks younger and quite different in his  Haircut
(
) Hey, Burt
You got it upside down
The eyes go on top
72 Cameron hands the photo back to the Chief, who passes it around the table
Denise receives the photograph, studies it and glances up at Cameron, expressionless
He returns her gaze
(
) couple of telephone linemen say they saw him headed this way
Eli takes the photograph
Looks like a nice clean-cut kid
know about fifty guys who don't think so
What'd he do
(to Production Manager, ignoring Eli's question) The minute that film gets here you give me a call
(yawning and rising) don't know about those fifty guys, but  know one weary guy who's gonna crawl upstairs and hit the sack
Eli looks at Cameron with grudging admiration
know a weary guy who's driving to Cape Long to dance and booze all night
- 45 - (camping, takes Gabe's hand) know a weary gay who's going with him
They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of Raymond's strictly masculine looks)
Eli shouts after them
So long as you're back in ninety minutes
It's a work night for some of us
(loftily) Those who give a shit
Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her shoulders -- Cameron watching silently
Then, charging from across the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed
Miss Franklin
Miss Franklin
Your 'Feminique Spray' commercial is on My God, it's simply heavenly
73
'   -    - Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his few belongings into his pockets
It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc
, in evidence
Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the dresser
He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty
He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door
Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false teeth, which he finally finds
Now, annoyed at himself for being a "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly exits
- 46 - 74
- As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company pulls to a stop in the driveway
Nina, Raymond and a few others emerge from the car
Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance
Bet they're looking for that nut who killed all those campers in Montana
(drunk) Too many campers, weed 'em out
Imagine, sitting an hour at a roadblock
We should have waited, it wouldn't have been an hour
74A   They've entered the hotel
Cameron continues to the bottom of the stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina
75    ' Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about her face -- a hauntingly romantic image
76 He watches for a moment with hopeless longing
Finally, turning from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk
There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby spot to light a night shot
There's the
He stares at it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen if
' What next
Do you rescue the maiden from the tower
She has come up behind him, unnoticed
He turns, startled, and there she stands
- 47 - (smiles) Hi
For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions
Then she glances at the tower
Yes
It does look pretty high
(with concern) Are you worried about tomorrow
Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she would know him instantly
But his answer is simple and sounds sincere
Not much
guess if there were any real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do it, would he
(quickly, reassuring) No
'm sure it's safe
(abruptly, with a boyish grin) Good
Then you jump
(laughing) Okay
She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in Eli
Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge
Well, come on
(willing, but flustered) What, right now
For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay
Then acts on his decision
Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her toward the tower
She holds back, struggling playfully
- 48 - (') Wait, 'm afraid of heights
What if  freeze up
(pulling her along) Don't worry, 'll give you a push
Isn't that what a pal's for
77
- It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded them
The city lights are seen beyond
Below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting
Just beyond is the overwhelming silhouette of the huge
Nina and Cameron reach the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the railing and lean over
Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine fright
(gasps) Oh, my God
It's terrifying
You can't jump from this
you'll get killed
It's crazy
(laughing) It's not that bad
It looks worse at night
Chuck says it's like robbing a candy store
(getting angry) Now stop that
'm going back
She whirls to go
He stops her, taking her by the shoulders
What's wrong
Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her child for running in the street
It's just dumb
to strut around trying to talk brave
His arm still restrains her
She takes hold of it, then suddenly softens with a look of slight surprise
(') - 49 - Oh
you are scared
aren't you
(seriously) Not really
Yes
You are
You're trembling
After a moment, he answers quietly
So are you
and you're not even gonna jump
It's true
She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear
He slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his
And then they are devouring each other
Abruptly, they're illuminated by a fierce blast of white light
They separate and stare, blinking in shock and confusion
(
) Okay, hit two and three
They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs
Quickly she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing
78
-    - Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane
Beside him Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes
(business as usual) could kill this brute and fill with juniors
You'd get a halo around the tower
(struggling to resist) Got no time
it's an establishing shot
two seconds on the screen
(giving in) You got six minutes
Gabe smiles, scurries off
Eli glances at the tower, grins, having toyed with them long enough, he yells
- 50 - Hey
While you're up there, be useful
We're lighting
Stand up and look towards the sea so you're in profile
79       - As Nina's arm raises into view with the middle finger extended
(
) (hollering) Light this, Eli
80
-    - The church door swings open
Nina and Cameron emerge, covering their embarrassment with bravado
Nina is prattling as though to a tour guide
81 And those bells are so interesting
Imagine four hundred years ago by boat from Amsterdam
Thank you for the tour
It was so informative
'm going to write my father
He's so interested in God and things like that
' Hiya
Want a lift
Eli miraculously appears from above
He descends and rides around beside them in the bucket of the crane
(ducking) Oh, for Christ's sake
There once was a maiden fair, smooching a guy with red hair
Eli, get away with that thing
- 51 - Could it be Raymond who's turning this dame on
Or his double, young Lucky Pierre
Unable to elude Eli in his basket, Nina turns on him in mock frustration
It's gotten to the point where have to look under the stopper of the bathtub when  take a shower to make sure 've got some privacy
(broadly gesturing to group) Thank you one and all and good night
Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then disappears around the corner of the building
He is left holding the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket
It has now dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron
Step right in, folks
the "Killer Crane" ride of the century
Thanks, 'll walk
Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at Cameron, riding beside him while he walks
Ah, youth
Six hours in town and caught with the leading lady
Not bad
Shouldn't be so upset
Okay to be upset about what happened in the dining room
Why'd you promise to show that cop the film
He'll recognize me
You really don't trust me, do you
Hop in
got a present for you
- 52 - He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that Cameron drops Sam's bag
Eli picks it up and plops it into Cameron's lap
Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on
probing, disarming, quixotic
(') You constantly amaze me
You don't go to movies
What's that tatoo, a disguise
You a Commie
Don't you know that King Kong was only three feet tall
He came up to Fay Wray's belly button
If God could only do the tricks we can
What are you worried about the film and the cop for
Now, hanging ten stories above the city, Eli is adjusting his viewer, looking at a cluster of
He hands the viewer to Cameron, who looks through it
81A   We see a telescoped view of    at the end of a highway with cars waiting to get past
' (muttering) What am  worried about the cops for
' Another one over there
81B      to a second police roadblock at the other entrance to town
'  (') It's a pair
81C (puts viewer down) Is this my present
No, your present is a piece of good advice
Keep it
- 53 - (patting Sam's beach bag) You've got that look again
That gleam of the sprinter about to set a record for the 50-yard dash
Is that why all those cops are chasing you
What are you, some kind of sex freak running across America with your fly open
Is that why they're after you
You're close
What's your advice
Button your fly and be at the airport on Sunday at three o'clock with the rest of the crew
Climb aboard our chartered 707 and fly away with us to where the setting sun bleeds into a million swimming pools a man can hide in
You do swim as well as run
(overwhelmed by the offer) 'll swim like a fish
You really mean it
(Eli nods) Why are you trying to save my ass
Eli hesitates, then answers quietly -- for him there is great meaning in it
Because you're as crazy as the guy 'm doing the picture about
(then grinning archly, the mood broken) Besides, 've fallen madly in love with the dark side of your nature
- 54 - 82
-   - The thunderous clang of bells
Cameron ready, coiled tight, heart pounding as loud as the bells
burst of machine gun bullets tears through the railing beside him, sending splinters flying against his face
83 (Second Unit Director) and   behind the , looking up tensely
Harvey gestures, yelling
Now
84 Near Cameron, the
, crouched out of sight with a walkie- talkie, stabs a finger at him
Go
Go
burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron
Sparks fly, as stray bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells
85 50-calibre  , a    in Levi's and sport shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower
86     - The Second
slams his hand down on a , setting off a series of explosive squibs
Like machine gun bullets, they start shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the edge of the tower
Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower
Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand
He shoves out, launching himself into space
Twisting, hurtling across the gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof, crawling and scrambling for a hand hold
The relentless tracer bullets chip the slate beside him
Crouching low, Cameron, like an animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower
Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the tower
- 55 - Moving around the tower, suddenly there are running at him with bayoneted rifles
He wheels and there stands (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his rifle butt
The blow glances off Cameron
They grapple, kicking, clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum
87 The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop
Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles in space toward the ground
88 Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his eyes glazed, he pulls himself back on the roof
89 Chuck, lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which caught him on the ground, looks up, cups his hands and shouts at Cameron
Go
Go
90 Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the soldiers shooting down at him from the roof's peak
He reaches the far end, looks down
There is the awning jutting from an adjacent wall two stories below
He scrambles off the roof
Clinging to the down spout, he starts descending it
91 Looking up from the ground, he yanks a control rope
92 The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose
The spout starts to fall away from the side of the building
Cameron clings to it, riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree
- 56 - 93 At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe landing and smashes against the awning
Instead of holding, it rips apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas toward a skylight one floor below
94 Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's body
He hurtles downward toward a blur of images
95 Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall
The  and  who were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll entwined with him
Cameron is dazed
Like a drowning man, he rages to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh
painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is in is thrown open, revealing: 96 Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War German army brothel
In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row of cots separated by makeshift screens
jump up from the cots startled
line of partly naked   waiting their turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's unorthodox entrance
They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron fell and now struggles with the couple
97 Gabe at the  , Eli beside him, photographing the scene
Keep rolling
(calling out to soldiers) The clothes
Do the clothes
98 The men tear him free from the couple shouting playfully
(dialect) What are you a field marshal
- 57 - (dialect) Wait your turn like the rest
Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes away, passing him back toward the rear of the line
(dialect) Where are your manners
(dialect) This is a whorehouse, not a stable
Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in glee
As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters, the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body
' Cut
Instantly everything stops
Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his knees at the end of the line
Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has caused this humiliation
Then the  begins, the  and applauding his stunt
People slap him on the back admiringly
robe is thrown around him
He is helped to his feet
Suddenly Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the mouth
'm so proud of you
could just die
He is pulled away from her by the backslappers
Now Cameron is responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public acclaim
He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't noticed
Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake blood inside; the "wound" is gone
He starts feeling Cameron's shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage
(quietly to Chuck, wincing in pain) Why didn't you tell me about the awning
could have been killed
- 58 - No chance
You were in your mother's arms from the time you hit the sugarglass skylight
Those stunt men you fell on would have got you out of anything
Stunt men
The one with the tits and the other guy
Why didn't you tell me
Afraid 'd chicken out
Eli likes some things spontaneous
Makes 'em more believable
You're okay
Whaddya want
Not to think 'm going crazy
99 He is moving through the crowd
(yelling) Where's Raymond
Raymond, were you watching that closely
(appearing) What can  tell you
'm a brave son-of-a-bitch
There is general laughter
Eli, raising his arm like a referee
All right
We're doing the coverage
Camera here
Eli continues toward Cameron
Chuck is spraying ethyl chloride on his bare tattooed shoulder
- 59 - (') (to Chuck) Careful
Don't blind the eagle
(to Cameron) owe you six hundred bucks
(acknowledging the compliment) If anything bothered you, be happy to do it again
Eli laughs and moves off, Cameron staring after him
(to Chuck) can't take my eyes off the son-of- a-bitch
Everybody does what he wants them to, even me
feel like thankin' him 'cause  fell on my ass
(sarcasm) It's just a crush
You'll get over it
99A Approaching Eli, who turns to Sam, eager, vulnerable
What did you think
You are a smug, insufferable son-of- a-bitch
When  read the insane asylum scene to my wife and four children, my wife cried, my oldest son shook my hand for the first time in his whole life
So, why is it, Eli, that this vulgar little scene turns out to be so much
stronger, more moving
- 60 - (touched) God knows, Sam
Maybe
because you get the feeling that the enemy might just be some poor horny slob like you, lookin' for the nearest whorehouse
(putting his arm around Cameron) How about that, Lucky
When that stunt man's boob hit you in the mouth, was it just another boob
or did it taste like kraut
The crew laughs and so does Nina
Cameron feels humiliated by Eli's patronizing tone
It tasted lousy
But what do know
You try it, Eli
You're the expert in bad taste
(for the group) Uh-oh, sounds like the soldier's got his feelings hurt
Naw, naw
just don't know about Germans
Where  was we only raped gooks
100
- As though continuing previous dialogue
(genially) Oh, is that why the cops are after you
After all this time
(sarcastic) Damn
You finally guessed it
100A Revealing Eli and Cameron walking through the hotel  toward a replica of the lost Duesenberg which a  works on
- 61 - Really
Rape
No
think you're putting me on
Come on, now, no more hints
(he thinks) Let's see
Christ, could be anything
know a guy in this state got 20 years for having cunnilingus with his wife
(studies Cameron) No
guess you're not the type
More likely some hideous crime of violence
Eli is getting under Cameron's skin
They stop at car
(to mechanic) Have you seen Harvey
think he's in there
Mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage
Eli pats the fender of the Duesenberg
Cameron views it with a strange sense of unease
Putting his arm around Cameron's shoulder, Eli leads him toward the back door yelling to mechanic
You'll have it ready on time
Yeah, but don't look under the hood or you'll find a Chevy
100B   At the door, Eli can barely open it to squeeze through
101 An incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny smoke-filled room, peering over each other's heads toward a lighted area at the far end
(shouting) Harvey in here
- 62 - (yelling) Quiet
We're shooting
(then back to business) Come on
let me have a little more face
a little more face
Eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers and tugs on Cameron's sleeve to join him
102 Hazily, through the restless shifting limbs, male and female, like the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the forest, we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter epic: Two people screwing in a rowboat
Raymond suddenly throws his hands up in despair
(screaming) Cut
(indignantly) Jesus, Kenneth
Great control
All right, who's doubling for Kenny on the inserts
103 Cameron and Eli rise to their feet
Can you believe this
They spend the whole day working in a whorehouse and look how they relax
That's dedication
You think sex can save the world
(grins at Cameron) That's not my bag, Eli
Sex, or saving the world
The world, that's your special job
And Jesus, are we all lucky to have you around
Suddenly Cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes against it to get in
- 63 - 104 It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina
(to Eli) Hey Chief, ya lookin' for me
Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the room
Cameron steps toward her without thinking
He wants her out of there
What's happening
What's going on
(joking) Look who's here
Nina, we need you
Still got your makeup on
Nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs
That's a daring touch, Raymond
The rowboat
Terribly symbolic
There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron
He surprisingly finds himself angry at Nina's presence here and everyone's easy familiarity toward her
She sees Cameron and Eli through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling
Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din
(kidding her) Just like the old days, huh kid
Remember the sunglasses and garter belts back when we got our start
Make you nostalgic
More laughter
Nina turns to Cameron
Hi Lancelot
What's a nice boy like you doing in a place like this
Going to rescue the maiden from the boat
He just asked if he could do the rowing
Didn't you, kid
- 64 - Having fun with me, aren't you
It's Eli's potty training class
Show little Lucky the pretty lady
Make dirt on the pretty lady
Watch little Lucky puke
Trouble with you is you think the whole world is your own personal crapper
(Cameron starts to exit) Have yourself a time
Just wallow around in it, man
Watching you makes me feel like Mr
Clean
Cameron storms out in a rage
Eli watches with a thoughtful smile
Sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to Eli, furious: Goddamn little prudish bastard
No more than you and me
it's the human condition
We just hide it better
Are you kidding
If That guy in the rowboat was a Marine sticking a bayonet in her instead of a cock, that uptight son-of-a-bitch would have saluted
Eli starts laughing
(') Fucking Fascist
What are you laughing at
It's just
that girl in the rowboat, she looks exactly like your daughter, Jennifer
(outraged) Goddamn you, Eli
That's not funny
He grabs Eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist
(laughing and wrestling) - 65 - Get 'em, Sam
Sic 'em
Kill 'em, boy
That's my uptight killie doggie
Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into Eli's trap
Where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish as Cameron
Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sam's neck
Son of a bitch
(still laughing) See what  mean
Old Victoria's still got us all by the balls
God save the queen
Only difference is, we like to make movies about it
With hardly a pause, he turns
(') Harvey, dailies at six o'clock tomorrow morning
We're shooting at seven
Rubbing his hands together (the old pro taking over), he starts pushing his way through the crowd
(') All right now, let's put a little bit of class into this production
He elbows his way to center stage
105
- On the folding chairs facing the  , a dozen people are silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies
Cameron enters, pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark
- 66 - 106 In the dimness, Nina sits separated from Eli, Sam and a few others
On the screen, a World War  British biplane in steady flight is interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts
Another subliminal flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen
It's a ""  -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the night before
What the hell is that
The watchers all break up, recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe
Hey Nina, there's your toothpaste commercial
love her smile
As Nina laughs good-naturedly, the airplane is back on the portable screen
107 Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last night, he walks over and sits down beside her
(whispering) How they get the film developed so fast
Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some distance away
He is stunned, then angry
Then confounded
Then resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her
What's the matter
(turning on him) Don't let the fact that Eli treats you as an equal go to your head
You're not
Thanks
' - 67 - Nina, we're watching dailies
'm sorry, Eli
But he can say anything and that's okay
That's right
That's great
What goes on in that dim little head of yours
How dare you open your mouth to him like that
Have you the vaguest idea what he's trying to say to people with this film
That man is the most dedicated, kindest
Eli's voice interrupts, angry, like a schoolteacher dismissing a child for talking
' Nina, you can go now
Nina, close to tears, quickly gets up and hurries out of the theater, as Cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen
107A On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the cockpit of an airplane
He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it go
Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in "")
' Who says nothin' changes
Like to see one of our boys in a -52 try that
Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track
The angle on the portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face
- 68 - Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we see the same biplane flying low
An object drops from the cockpit (the boot)
Then there is a burst of flame in the engine
Trailing smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to )
It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our eyes during the crash
There are groans, laughter and raspberries 107B
(    ) Jesus, Eli, 'm sorry
'll do a pickup
(laughing) It's so awful, it's beautiful
Wish could use it
(sarcastic) That's all we'd need
107C (getting morose) We goddamn well need something, Sam
Something better than we got
(tight-lipped) Better
How better
Wilder, crazier
(starting to shout) Dropping a dead man's boots over his own airfield, out of chivalry
that's not crazy enough for you
They did it in "Wings
"    Even the dummy was bored
- 69 - (anxiety at the breaking point) Eli, please
You simply will not accept the fact that we are living on borrowed time
But Eli and Sam are not listening
You can't shake your finger at 'em, Sam
If you've got something to say, you better slip it in while they're laughing and crying and jacking off over the sex and violence
He should do something
outrageous
(belligerent) Like what
Something to catch the stink of madness behind all that good clean fun
Why the hell did we pick World War  in the first place
The ultimate romantic insanity
(shouting) Like what
Like
don't know what
What would Lucky do if he were on the wing of that plane
Picture that because it would be a hell of a lot realer than that flapping dummy
108   Cameron is startled
He was not aware that Eli even knew he was in the room
Is that what you're after, reality
thought you wanted something outrageous
- 70 - Reality can be pretty outrageous
Look at soldier boy there, jumping off fucking buildings, risking his ass every day, doing stuff way over his head
What would you do in that plane, Lucky, if you were about to die
(off guard, embarrassed) What else
'd dance for joy
'd probably do a jig
Great
That's what we'll do
Eli
All right, not a jig
a Charleston
Charleston
On the wing of the airplane
(contempt) That's ridiculous
You're damn right
The Charleston is silly
They won't believe it
(excited) 'll do it so they'll believe it
(smugly) You'll get a laugh, Eli
- 71 - Only when  want them to laugh
(toward rear of the room) Right, Lucky
109   (   ) -      - It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every direction
The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground
The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black smoke through which we see a brightly colored  descending
The  dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze
It is Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform
110 To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him, steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness
With the camera, they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four- legged creature
Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some advancing German soldiers back toward the woods
The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning
Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet
Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British plane
It is a single-seater
It starts to pick up speed
He grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing
111 The bucket hanging from the giant  descends
Smoothly Eli guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket
The bucket rises, lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with Cameron on the wing becomes airborne
112 Behind it is a    who jump up and down shrieking
to show Nina among them, her excitement hardly more controlled
- 72 - 113 The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane, completing Gabe's spectacular shot
Now we see a  drop into frame, photographing the plane from the other side
The chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun
114 Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly against the struts
His white silk scarf streams into the tearing wind
Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds it up
The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream
Laughing, he passes a glass to Cameron and pours from above
The liquid is lost in the wind
Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron
Cameron drinks
The champagne pours down his throat and face and, holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet
The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his bottle back
Cameron now seems drunk
He lets go of the strut and stands leaning against the wind
As the pilot toasts his courage, Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut
Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of the wing
Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane
The pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm
" And Cameron dances the Charleston
115 Gabe at the eyepiece of the Mitchell, slowly tilting up and down to follow the action
Fan-fucking-tastic
Whaddya been feeding that soldier-boy
brave pills
Through the plastic bubble, the biplane can be seen in the distance going through its antic maneuvers
It's not what he's eating
it's what's eating him
that makes it sort of interesting
(through intercom) Okay, drop the package
116 - 73 - Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go
Then, the pilot is struck by a bursting shell
As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips and drops off into a spin
Cameron clings for his life as the sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space
117 Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane
The crewmen shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving
Cameron is, indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the centrifugal force
But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet instead of to certain death
118         - How is it
(panning and tilting) Su-fucking-perlative
(into walkie-talkie) Okay, now level out
119 Easing some levers back
120 As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out, Cameron regains his footing, perches on the wing and looks forward in growing horror
121 As the swinging arm of the crane glides the plane forward toward a stand of trees at the edge of a clearing
- 74 - 122     - We see the rapidly approaching trees
Closer and closer, until with a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off the wing like a crumb flicked from the table
123      - Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending impact
gasp and then a sharp cry
But instead of the crash
the   and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm
With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina, who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time
124     -
'   - They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite), untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the leftovers of a room service dinner
Nina caresses his back, noticing bruises
She kisses them gently and starts to giggle
He looks at her quizzically
That's twice for me today
Now
And when  watched you do the stunt
The   on the dresser
He sits up, puzzled
(') have to study my scene for tomorrow
The Old Lady at the cemetery
It's brutal
set the clock in case we dozed off
Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock, but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig
He runs his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring
How come they cast you as an old lady
start out as a young girl hiding this American flyer
'm Austrian
Will ya turn off the clock
Subtly, we sense something is bothering Cameron
He ignores the still-ringing clock
- 75 - (') Anyway, his patriotism is stronger than his love and he leaves me with another little patriot in my belly
During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing in the mirror
Why can't  double for both of you
could use the money and  don't look half bad
(seriously) Honey, you'll ruin it
Take it off
He does
(') The clock's electric
It'll ring forever
Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress on a hanger
He looks at the dress appraisingly
Eli might really go for that, the big soldier as a little old lady
Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and adjusts the wig properly on its stand
What's wrong
Everything's beautiful
They embrace and cling to each other
She starts back for the bed, but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and again it
What are you doing
- 76 - We've got to consider Eli
If you don't study the scene, he'll be mad
then you'll get mad
and 'll get shot out of a cannon
With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed
Did you fall on your head today
want it to ring
Why
For me, that's why
That's Eli yelling for you to work on your scene and us saying, "Up yours, Eli," and  like that
Do you want to leave
want to make love to you while Eli is screaming his head off
The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing
He gets on the bed with her
They struggle about, giggling at the absurdity
can't make love with the clock ringing
Betcha can
While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at the clock
It falls over, but keeps on ringing
By now, Cameron has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that, than in the clock
(to ringing clock while making love to Nina) You tell 'em, Eli
- 77 - In the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback, splattering shards of light against Chuck's intensely watching face
He is highly disturbed at the unseen image
(to himself) Crazy bastard
, showing a small   has been converted to a makeshift  , where Chuck sits working the
Slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway
There was no way it could go wrong
unless he just went ape
Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more time
Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward, he realizes he's seeing '   in the water
Now Chuck has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward again
125A     - The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and sinking beneath the surface
Burt goes through the motions of a man trying to free himself
The harness is okay
the roof is holding
it all seems fine
But look at him struggle
Badly
Eli wouldn't use a foot of it
poor slob died for nothin'
126 Sweat is running down Cameron's face
Finally, with dread
That crack
in the windshield
- 78 - What about it
Probably from the impact
No water coming in
Cameron's face reflects immense relief
At least he's not guilty of that
The flung stone was not the cause
Now, abruptly, Burt's body begins to move more violently
' There
Look at that
He's starting to panic
Will you, for Christ's sake, tell me why
As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and windshield
For an instant, the current changes the light and the crack glows brightly, like a spider web
Burt reappears, his face now toward camera, wild with terror
The slow motion lends a bizarre elegance to his agony
Abruptly, the
Shit
That's where it stops
That fuckin' Henry
got spooked and took his finger off the remote button
Is this how the story was supposed to end, with the flyer dying in the water
Sure as shit ended that way for Burt, didn't it
127
- In one of the private   off the lobby, tables and chairs are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in progress
Some early morning  have gathered outside the entrance, watching
few members of the kitchen staff peer through an inside doorway
Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as Eli rehearses with Nina
- 79 - (gesturing) The graveyard's over here
(he takes a few steps) Her car's parked here
(sets down a folding chair) Lots of these little graveyards along the roadside
most of the stones are unmarked
He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on the floor
(') You're tired
you're broke
all things which meant so much are gone
What's left is a single memory
that brief bright love
Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye
Among the tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his costume slung over his shoulder
He nods to her with a small tender smile
Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews her concentration
(') You spent your month's pension in hiring the car
You just can't look for his grave any longer
so you pick one
any one
You kneel
then lay the flowers down
(yells to the prop man) What have we got for her
got roses
No
something she picked herself
wildflowers or something
Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina
- 80 - (hesitantly) Eli
An idea, maybe
Instead of flowers, what if she brought him the things of their life together
of their sexuality
like her nightgown, her underclothes
Eli looks at him thoughtfully
(') 'Course they'd be rags by now, but let me show you this
From a paper bag, he takes a    of a  and on a  beneath a tree
He sets it down
128 Sam's hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze
There is a whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays
The girl begins to swing
The bear slides toward her
She mechanically lifts her bronze dress until they meet, performing their clockwork love rite
Nina giggles
' It's authentic
Early Victorian
Mechanical bronzes were quite a thing
129 Eli shakes his head patiently, kindly
Sam, you'll get a belly laugh
What do you mean
It'll break their hearts
Eli begins to beam
Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the trap, winces, chagrined
Eli grabs him in a bear hug
Welcome to the picture, Sam
Sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as Eli dances him about in joy
130

' (trimming his hair) You're confused
He got it into her in five minutes
To get it out of her

There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target
The thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron
'  (') Oops

The effect is stronger than she had expected
Now compassion sets in

"  know that is hard to believe
(shrugging) Anything is possible, signora

() As soon as  am gone, you will take everything away
No

We loved each other
Where else should these go
The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a who've gathered beside their   watching
() Yes,  know 'm ridiculous, but you laugh without knowing anything
You would buy a plastic wreath for a man of such importance
She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down, stumbles and falls
Now, like some confused child, she searches among the garments
Taking a  from a wooden box, she shakes it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler
() President Wilson
from the President of the United States
for heroism
To me for sheltering him
(smiling to herself) How silly
'sheltered' him to be with him
He was my beloved
Where is it
Oh, here, did you see this
She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash
() Given to me by Adolf Hitler
for our son
Our son
Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory
() Our son
(then, with simple reverence) thousand years of peace
is what he said
That would be very nice
The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into a , which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the grave and shattering all illusion
The Caribinerri stands there - 85 - with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the grave
Nina stands in speechless horror
133     - (quietly) Cut
Eli, 'll kill myself
and print
It's deadly silent as Eli walks over to Nina
They stare at each other for a moment
(eyes brimming over) Thank you, baby
They fall into each others arms like lovers never do
134    - Everybody is applauding, wild with joy over Nina's great performance
Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sam's nose
Only Cameron is sullen, seething with anger and jealousy as he views them in the light of his recent information
(through bull horn) All right, that wraps the graveyard
Don't pack it
just stick it in the truck
Come on, we're losing sun, everybody
In ten minutes at the farmhouse
Cameron is standing aside, while Nina vainly looks around for him
Denise is unpinning her wig
Chuck approaches Cameron
- 86 - Change of plans
We're making the stunt a fire gag
When you come out of the barn, you're in flames
wanna try it
Cameron, still watching Nina and Eli in the now dwindling circle of admirers, doesn't answer
(') Look, don't do it if you don't wanna
What does Eli say
You know Eli
"Tell the soldier it's an extra hundred bucks and he'll do it without the asbestos
" Whaddya say
Tell Eli to do it
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you
'm tired of being somebody's goddamn clown
(moving into the shot) Hey, you don't want to do it, don't do it, but be happy
It's a great day
Did you see her performance
Terrific
It's a day for humility and brotherly love
Fine, Eli
Let's be brotherly
Milk brothers, sucking from the same tit
- 87 - 135    -
- As it explodes, Cameron is     --
He tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with muddy water
Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a an   hurtles toward him, the driver dead and mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror
Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him
He rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson barely missing him
Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all about
Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell
136 As Cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden  near the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest
137 Who said that
Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry, the assistant cameraman, uneasily faces Eli
We had a film run-out
(to Gabe) How many feet are left in that camera
(checking the Mitchell) Thirty-six feet
Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a rage we have not seen in him before
Goddamn you
How many times are you going to do this to me
How dare you yell cut on my set
- 88 - (defensively) Thirty-six feet is nothing
It's twenty-two seconds
In twenty- two seconds,  could break your spine
could pinch your fucking head off like an insect and smear it on the pavement
could put twenty-two bullets in that fat gut of yours
The only thing  can't seem to do in twenty-two seconds is keep you from fucking up my film
Cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an  is burning through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the pleasure of savoring Eli's anguish
138      -  (
'  '  - ) Rosy-faced and dewy-eyed and wearing a big floppy hat
Sensing trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault, she has decided to do a campy, cutesy Blanche Dubois stepping off " " number, ten years too soon
(southern-belle sarcasm) can't tell you how pleased was with your conduct
When you congratulated me after my scene this afternoon, all the other glowing tributes faded to nothing
139     -
'  ' Sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm
Cameron lies on his bed in a -shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching Nina's performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room
- 89 - (') Nevertheless, 'm cancelling your invitation to an intimate party given by my parents, who arrived unexpectedly to honor me on the occasion of my birthday
but don't feel too badly
As consolation for a lovely evening missed, 'm presenting you with the "good-sport- of-the-month" award
From behind her back, she takes an  with a tiny cocktail parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron
Cameron lies glaring at her with mounting rage
(') Mr
Baum, will you notify this young savage that it's customary to cover one's privates when accepting an award
It's one of the common courtesies, like
congratulating people
(coldly) What should  congratulate you for
The fucking scene or for fucking the director
Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly
For fucking the director, honey
(biting into apple) Didn't you know that's how little girls get into the movies
She leaves
Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and storms into the bathroom
Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes typing
Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the bed
Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his knee
Sam's typing stops
(quietly) Young man, taking my life in my hands,  must inform you that you are an asshole
Cameron ignores Sam
- 90 - (') Being a devout masochist, it follows that 'm Eli's best friend
know quite a lot about him and Nina
You and the entire crew, buddy
(wryly) He met her three years ago
Two lonely people rattling around New York
brutal winter
Eli's marriage had just broken up
(interrupting in anger) All she had to do was tell me
' She could have done that in four seconds
They went to bed once and they were lousy as lovers
But they had a problem
They liked each other
They recognized some area of mutual sensitivity
'm boring you
You telling me he banged her once three years ago
' (disgusted) 'm going to see if they can put me up in the employees' toilet
He begins to type again, then philosophically
'  (') think he 'banged' her twice to confirm the awful truth
Was she supposed to be a virgin
Yeah
But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he has reached him and it touched
- 91 - had a virgin once
Had to go to Guatemala for it
She was blind in one eye and had a stuffed alligator that said, "Welcome to Miami Beach
" Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets
Then he gets up, goes to Sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes
Sam watches him curiously
So how's the new ending coming
got fourteen versions
Take your pick
(worried about his clothes) What are you doing in there
(overly casual) Fourteen gory ways to die
Thirteen
In one version he lives
turns the girl in, opens a gay bar in Berlin, gains fifty pounds and changes his name to Goering
(now deeply concerned) Please, anything but the sweaters
You'll stretch the hell out of the sleeves
140 The pleasant   is on the pier over the water
Cameron, now wearing Sam's sweater after all, is searching about the crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family
He is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a  and in their early fifties and a -- , attractive despite the baby fat
Something about the composite of all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look
In doing so, he sees a half-eaten   on their table, in front of an empty place
He goes to the table
- 92 - (hesitantly) was sort of invited to a birthday party and  can't seem to find it
and this seems to be a birthday party
The , a hearty, bluff, good-natured man, looks at Cameron amiably and with a father's intuition
birthday party is a birthday party
sit down
(Cameron does) Who was this birthday party for
animal, vegetable or mineral
, the fourteen-year-old, giggles
Mineral
Will you stop teasing this young man
She's really worth finding, ma'am
She's a very rare mineral
(pleased with Cameron) How old is this mineral
This morning she was acting about ninety, but she might be lying a year or two
The father now really comfortable, recognizing a fellow humorist
No, you got the wrong table
this one's acting like she's six
but the missus tells me birthdays are very emotional for the ladies
At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen Nina behind him
He turns
141 - 93 - Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is walking toward them
At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room
Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing with tears of happiness
142     -    - He moves forward and kisses Nina
We now realize we are at her She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar
With their mouths barely parting: 'm sorry it got so late
that damn five o'clock makeup call
feel as bad as you do
In the same place  do
Will you take a raincheck
(slipping her room key in his pocket) permanent one
He puts his hand on the pocket and grins at her

(smiling) Good night
Closing the door

- On  (the   who Eli screamed at), his luggage beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him on the bar top
(looking up) Lucky
hey Lucky, come over here
- 94 - shifts to include Cameron a few stools down
He looks up from his beer and crosses to henry
(') Guess who tole 'em to take their job and stuff it
Ya quittin'
Fuckin'
Gettin' out tonight
But not without splittin' a Schlitz with the one guy, 'cept me, who wouldn't take shit from that screwball
As the  is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger down on a
(') Change is for you, except that
That's a very special dime
(holds it up for Cameron to see) Know what this is
Ask me
It's a dime

It's Eli Cross' ass
People think 'cause you're easygoin' they can walk all over you
Bull-shit
'm blowin' the whistle with this dime in that phone
killin' a man and hiding it from the police
are you kiddin'
Who is he think he is
Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can expose him to the police
He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers and drops it into a
What the hell you doin'
Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the

He's mine, Henry, all mine
Just leave that son-of-a- bitch to me
They have reached the
By now, Henry is convinced Cameron means business
He stops
Do whatever you wanna do, but better do it with ya
You'll need help 'cause that goddamn looney is dangerous
(blustering) Not to me, he ain't
'm going to the cops
You gotta earn your living in pictures, but  don't give a shit
He can't hurt me
Don't be too sure
Damned psycho nearly strangled me
Don't believe me
Wanna see marks
(tears open shirt collar to show bruises) Lucky to be alive
(confused) Henry, what are you talking about
watched that whole thing today, he didn't even touch you
- 96 - Not today
When Burt went into the water
(Cameron is wide-eyed) could tell from up there in the chopper something' was wrong
So, stopped shootin' and that crazy man gets me by the throat and starts screamin' to roll the film
mean that guy's down there dying and he's screamin', "Keep shooting
Keep shooting
" Then, he starts fighting me for the switch and it falls down
like a crazy house up there, with him thrashin' on the floor
He didn't care about Burt
All he cared about was to get that man dyin' on film
Sickest thing  ever seen
As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken
(') better grab that cab
Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through the door, looks back for a parting shot
(') You tell 'em everything
don't mince words
As he goes towards cab, some  push their way into the lobby
144 Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant
The merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments
Cameron turns and walks across the   and  the
his pace increasing until he is taking them three at a time
145 Cameron's hand thrusts  into the hole, flings open the '  and barges in
(overwrought) Nina
your crazy Eli
- 97 - He
Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the bed
Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed, utterly disconsolate
The three stare at each other, an absurd tableau
Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him, almost off its hinges
146 He comes down the steps like a madman
Raging, Cameron stomps across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of Eli's grotesque wonderland
He collides with a group of returning night  still in their slickers, carrying their equipment, their catch wrapped in newspapers
For a moment he is tangled in their tackle,     along the marble floor
Jesus
don't step on 'em
Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and up the stairs
147
' As Cameron bursts in
She stands in her robe in the center of the room, glaring at him
(screaming) Get out of here
Hearing  running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the bathroom empty
He moves to the closet and slides the door so violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond
(') Get out
(raging) 'll have you thrown out
She crosses to the phone
Is there anybody in this whole company you haven't screwed
147A   In the , a little group of   turn in wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway
Nina leaves the phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces with all her strength
- 98 - (furious) You stupid, ignorant bastard
How dare you storm in here like you won me in a raffle
Cameron, realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed or frightened, she is livid with rage
(coldly) My girl gave me her key
am not your girl
am that man's girl
That man and  have been lovers for six months
've known you two days
(ironically) Then gee, ma'am,  sure hope you didn't tell him about all that ballin' last night
Don't you dare be clever with me
He came scratching at the door tonight like a beaten dog, begging me to say that you were some twenty- four hour nonsense
(against her will she starts to cry) and  had to tell him  thought was falling in love with
(not giving an inch) You couldn'a said that with your clothes on
Nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage
Goddamn you
The wounded stud
He is entitled to some dignity
To lose his "pure and faithful lover" without the new boy barging in
Where do you suppose he is now
Did ya look in the laundry hamper
- 99 - Get the
Cameron crosses to the door
Searching through this madness for some kind of logic, turning on her
don't have any rights
don't have the right to be pissed off
You don't have the right to breathe

Do you understand that
Before  met you
If we were frightened, we woke each other in the dark
we slept in each other's arms
(interrupting) The word is "fuck
" All right, the word is fuck
You narrow, insensitive, stupid
(interrupting) Don't
Don't push me
don't know this freaky world you live in, but know that there still must be a couple of places where people somehow believe in
He is at a loss for words
Believe in what
You're blushing
place where what
Don't get embarrassed at this late date
place where a guy has a right to blow his top if he finds his lover screwing
(interrupting) Raymond's lover
Raymond's lover
Say it
Raymond's lover
- 100 - Cameron, exhausted, slides down the wall and sits on the floor
(') 'll have it typed up and notarized
Raymond's lover
And you will sign where it says, agreed
He says nothing
She on the bed and he on the floor, are drained of all strength and emotion
(') (quietly) You won't turn me into some rotten whore because your papa once told that a woman is a certain way "and that's how it's gonna be 'til Gabriel blows his horn
" (wearily) Okay
okay
just want to sit a couple of seconds without having to say a word
Because if  start trying to say, "'m sorry  caught you and Raymond fucking," 'll start laughing and when  laugh too hard, get the hiccups and they can last for days
(after a long beat; softly) Don't get hiccups
(quietly) Isn't anything what it seems to be
(quietly) No
- 101 - (quietly) Don't you think that's kind of lousy
(quietly) Yes
They sit there unable to leave each other, unable to move to each other
They just sit there

- Dailies are in progress
Eli watches, surrounded by a few crew members
Cameron sits in the back row with Nina's , and
Nina is not present
On the   is a shot of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running pell-mell along a willow-lined  , dodging children and 148A   bicycles
She collides with an  , her basket falls, its contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected with her joy of life
He helps her refill the basket and she rewards him with a sausage and a kiss
The old man watches her wistfully as she runs away
149 There's a tear of pride in Nina's mother's eye
Father gently puts his hand on top of hers as the room lights come on
' You okay back there
Happy as clams

Isn't it amazing how they put it all together and

Their mouths meet
Their bodies writhe

Their once gentle hands grip each other like iron claws, trying to squeeze away the nightmare
153 In shock and anger, leaning forward on the edge of his chair, looking from Eli to the parents, not knowing what to do to stop this
154 She sinks down in her seat, her surprise becoming malicious pleasure at the reaction of her parents
155 (upset) Sweet Christ
told 'em to hold that
(starting to leave her seat) 'll stop it
- 103 - (restraining her, resigned) Too late now
only make it worse
We hear the passionate murmurings from the screen as Eli scrunches down in his seat
156 The lovers convulse with erotic abandon as they approach orgasm
157     ' Like a Charles Addams' rendering of a Brady tintype
Their faces wear the stiff frozen smiles of the hopelessly insane
158
- She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties
Everything about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain and loss
She is reacting in anguish to something
But, even though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true
Eli steps into the shot
(to the crew,
) All right, save it
159 On the sidelines, as he coldly watches Eli put his arm around Nina and stroll her away from the crew so they are out of earshot
160        - Nina
The shame of it
the shame
You've lost your son, your lover
You want to tear his throat out
but you stand meek
your guts burning with the shame of it
God,  don't know what's wrong with me
She has looked up at her parents, who stand off to one side like zombies, watching

Let me say bye-bye and get 'em on their way
It might help
She starts to move towards her parents but Eli puts a restraining hand on her

For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera, only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned into her father's memory
And yet, that shame is so similar to the shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this mockery of her son's death

mother has lost a son
The sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those German newsreels of Hitler victory rallies
(') This sacrifice in blood brings closer man's noblest dream
a thousand years of peace
The   of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil
Sieg Heil
" has shattered Nina's isolation
She is now aware that her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick, and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically making her performance even more poignant
The crowd on the playback roars with fanatic zeal
164
-    - Striding rapidly down the hall, looking like a man who hopes to find a fight, to dissipate his residual anger
He rounds a corner, almost colliding with Eli, who comes rapidly from an intersecting corridor
Eli puts his arm around Cameron's shoulder, hurrying him along even faster
Giddyap, soldier
Last one there's on Medicare
Cameron shrugs his arm off in annoyance as they round the corner and hurry down some
- 106 - Where are we rushing to
Was asleep
Trouble staying awake, huh
They reach the bottom of the steps and move swiftly down another corridor, as Eli fishes through his pockets and comes up with a (') Stick of gum

Short words
Eli finds a  he has been looking for and hands it to Cameron

But before Cameron can even register who they are, Eli is saying
'm sorry, gentlemen, but 've got exactly two minutes of borrowed time
'm in the middle of a scene
(to projectionist) Get it started
Immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the screen
In the dark, the men in the room fumble their way to seats
On the projection screen we see a helicopter Cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him
His eyes dart around at the official-looking faces staring at the
film
One face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it

Do you mind if we see that again
Help yourself, the room is yours
But 've got thirty people on the set being paid for doing nothing
(moving toward the door and calling) Come on Burt, you've got some reading to do
Cameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again
Hey Burt, glad you're still alive, considering who you're working for
166 Cameron moves swiftly down the corridor behind Eli, who starts up the stairs, still blithely chewing his gum
Something wrong
Why are you lagging
'm trying to figure it out
That film
Where was
How tall is King Kong
Three-foot-six
- 109 - Good boy
got all kinds of versions
Wanna go back and see some
Cameron understands the implied threat and Eli, knowing he has made his point, continues good-humoredly
(') 've even got a version where you fly the helicopter and 'm driving the Duesenberg
It's a dilly
166A   They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the grounds toward the set
What about the version where  go over the bridge and die in the water

That red dye must be eating through your scalp and affecting your brain
Why would  want to hurt you
Because you don't like my tatoo

It's heroic
think it's a major work that may rank with the Edsel grill
Now goddamnit,  gotta go back and do my picture
Will you take this thing and read
He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to reach out and take it
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the leaving the building, heading off in another direction
He stares at the booklet

who stepped on a bouncing Betty booby trap
Stepping on it wasn't his problem

So all - 110 - he could do was just stand there
It was getting light

So we left

Grinning, he sticks the booklet in Cameron's shirt pocket, turns and walks off

Why don't you let the kid go before he gets hurt
Chuck keeps an eye on him
He's dangerous to have around
Stop playing games, Eli
Tell Jake you've replaced him
What are you so hooked on
He helps me understand the kid in our story
Bullshit

' Scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost completed packing for tomorrow's departure
Nina lies in bed staring into nothing, Cameron beside her
Each is talking aloud to himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact with the other

" That's kind of witty
- 112 - (still in her own world) Could've handled it later on
It doesn't look so raunchy after it's cut
Maybe 'd of got them stoned
something
but for Eli to trap them like that
(eyes on the book) Beautiful
There's a second school of thought that says the first school is all wet
It says, "Keep the windows rolled up tight and wait for the air bubble
" Say it was an accident
benefit of the doubt
But then to use me that way
like a gadget
Why would Eli do that
He's not a cruel man
(not looking up) He's not a cruel man
He's a crazy man
maniac
What
(reading) "The water pressure at two hundred feet can crush a man into the size of an egg
" He wants to get that on film
so he's gonna kill me
(jumping out of bed) What in God's name are you babbling about
It's a rotten shame about your folks and your naked ass, but dying always scared me a little, okay
- 113 - and you are beginning to scare me
You're talking like a wild man
Did you know that Eli almost strangled a man because he stopped the camera when Burt got killed
What is going on in that head of yours
You take the word of some
malcontent
technician
saw the bruises
And  saw Eli that night when he had to tell Burt's brother on the phone
saw the tears
She saw the tears
Did you ask him what he was crying about
'Cause you can bet your sweet tits, it wasn't over Burt
He was crying over losing his fucking shot
To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts repacking
Didn't they give
tests in the army
What did you get
minus twelve
Haven't you figured out yet why he's working himself to death
What his film is all about
He's trying to tell people not to kill each other
And you know what
You want the shock of your life
understand what the son-of-a-bitch is saying, and he may be right
which makes me what
Minus twelve, the dumb schmuck with a gun
That doesn't change the fact that he's crazy
If he had his way, there wouldn't be a soldier left alive by morning
But - 114 - all he's got on hand is me
don't know if he is doing it consciously, but it's a hell of an idea
If he can really get it on film, a genuine dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before your very eyes,  mean the real McCoy
that's gotta help his picture
Then he's killed two birds with one stone
It's got a nice logic
Trouble is, both birds are me
Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron says
Stop it
sweetheart
'd die if anything happened to you
The
Her head whips to look at it
It continues ringing, but she doesn't move
It's my father
won't talk to him
You're all driving me crazy
won't talk to him
Cameron calmly picks up the phone
Hi
hello
(whispering) Tell them 'm not here
Tell them anything
Tell them 'm working
(glancing at Nina) Okay, Chuck
'll meet you in an hour
(he hangs up) For me
Amazing how they keep secrets around here
He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her
She leans against him, the trembling subsiding
What if  told you  wasn't going to do the stunt
- 115 - 'd say fine
And what if  told you  was gonna get out of here tonight
and that want you to come with me
(upset and confused) But there's just one more day of shooting
What if  can't wait
have two more scenes
That's a shame
could meet you
When he doesn't answer, Nina resorts to her last defense, irrational anger
(') Look, don't do the stunt
If you believe Eli's a killer, call the police
Why are you doing this to me
That's all  need right now, with all 've been through
For you to give me now-or-never ultimatums and tell me my director is insane
By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her
- 116 - 169
-   - Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim
Chuck and Cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the Sunday Special on a used car lot, Chuck the "hearty" salesman, Cameron the reluctant customer
Look at this mother
'll bet these guys could build an Arabian out of a jackass
Why not
You built a stunt man out of one
Stunt man
Three days and you've already grown those big brass balls
Jump up and down and let me hear 'em clang, and then do me a favor and leave 'em home for this gag
(yanks open the door) There's just enough room in that Duesenberg for a normal guy
who thinks
(Cameron slides in) Show me how long you can hold your breath
Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch
- 117 - Now, look around
Whaddya see
No roll bar in the roof
That's because the roof caving in really looks gassy on film
You got your protection in the back of the seat
steel sheeting
If the roof goes too far, you get your goddamn head down quick
You listening to me
Nod Your head
(slapping Cameron on back) You got good lungs
(buckles Cameron's seatbelt) You got no shoulder harness because it would show on camera
So when you hit the water, you brace yourself against the steering wheel
It's reinforced
You couldn't break it loose with dynamite
you gettin' light-headed yet
Cameron shakes his head, "No
" Keep your hands off the doors
You're leaving through the window
You lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure
What are you waitin' for
'm not gonna be down there holding your hand
(Cameron lowering windows) Slower
When you hit bottom, the windows are open and you're gonna make like a minnow
But first, a little fresh air wouldn't hurt
You reach down under the seat and, what do you know, a respirator
Make like you're reaching for it
There'll be one there tomorrow
Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator
(') No, keep your face forward, the camera is behind you and it's still running
- 118 - By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to hold it
(') You feel like your lungs are gonna burst
Good
That's the way you're supposed to act like you feel
The moment that water gets above your nose, you gotta look like you're drowning
Remember
Burt wasn't so good at that
That knocks the wind out of Cameron
He sure as hell convinced me
Chuck clicks his stopwatch and scowls
(defensively) Things happen crossin' the street
If somethin' goes cockeyed
screw the scene
Get that mask on
There's enough oxygen to get you to China
(rolls up the window) We'll try it again
(still panting) Let me catch my breath
What you'll catch is a lungful of water
You're at the bottom of the river
You breathe when  goddamn tell you to breathe
(the pupil tricking the teacher) Hey, Chuck, you blind
Can't you see 've got my respirator on
You just goddamn remember you don't have gills
169A   Chuck has stalked over to the  and angrily picks up the , which has been ringing incessantly over the last few lines
- 119 - (shouting) What
(listens, then yells to Cameron) Eli's at the police station
That's the best news 've heard
Let's hope it's a felony
He needs Gabe
They're lookin' for a driver so 'm gonna take him
Come on with me
For what
(climbing into the company car) You and me are gonna talk about windows and oxygen and seat belts and things like that
And if you're a good boy and listen and don't be a smart ass, maybe 'll let you sit in the back seat with Nina Franklin
Nina
Chuck, already in the car, is grinning
Now he's even for the "respirator" bit
You might even get to hold hands
170
- The   comes into view, seen through the window of the company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb
Eli, sitting on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion
As he sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door almost before it stops
- 120 - (beckoning) Gabe, Nina
Eli pulls Gabe and Nina toward the police station, yelling back to Cameron and Chuck
(') You two better wait here
Cameron watches them, confused, as they start up the steps toward the station house
171     - , ,  - hate this, damn it
Couldn't you have done it without me
Let's say you owe it to him
Until two or three days ago,  had a pretty good actor on my hands
Next time you take out the clippers, be a little humane, make sure the guy's got one to spare
(furious) What did you want me to do
Take him in the back room and unzip his fly every time he fluffed a line
What else can  do for your film
Just get your greedy little ass inside and make sure you give the performance of your life
(icily) This next number,  dedicate to you
dear
- 121 - 172 As the three enter
The station is old with a high sergeant's desk and wooden benches against the walls
Raymond, beyond tears, destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts, stoned kids, etc
On one bench is a , with that adenoidal look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch" arrogance
Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that he has finally nailed Eli Cross
Eli captures the setup in a glance
then, instant theater
He strides across the police station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack on the mouth
(vehemently) Who's better, booby
him or me
Gabe has come up behind a , grabs him by the hips and starts humping like a dog in heat
The policeman shrieks in dismay and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked
(shouting) Jake
Throw some water on him, quick
Only way to get 'em apart
Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with growing disbelief
Gabe ogles him
Yummy
look at the seafood
You're a humpy little number
(then to Raymond, stamping his foot) You nasty boy
You could've died of mercury poisoning
The sailor leaps to his feet in horror, screaming
Jesus Christ, they're all faggots
173     ' Eli has stormed to the counter and slams his fist down on it furiously, confronting Jake
- 122 - (shouting) 'm registering a complaint
Thirty- two members of my company got
from your local virgins
The Chamber of Commerce didn't say anything about that in their brochure
You can stop clowning, Eli, 've got a sworn complaint from this sailor
(jabbing his finer in Raymond's
direction) Your man over there touched his genitals
174 She is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his neck and cheek
Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation, is too sick with self-loathing to respond
175 Oh, Jake
Come on
You wouldn't know your anal invert from a hole in the ground
Raymond makes bad jokes, but they're not illegal
Christ, you've seen us all on the set
clowning around
176 Cameron stands, peering in through the big front window, feeling once again betrayed
It's like watching  with the sound shut off
From here, Nina and Raymond are very convincing
Chuck leans against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on
- 123 - 177 Eli now going full blast
My company's been pouring sixty thousand dollars a week into this place, for which your mayor and governor seem very grateful
We paid enough in taxes and fees alone to buy you parking meters from here to the boardwalk
(feeling it's all going wrong) Everything  said in that statement is the flat-ass truth
Eli pays no attention, knowing that he's got Jake
He gestures toward Nina embracing Raymond
Jake,  got a very horny leading lady who's got an early call and would like to spend some time with her boyfriend before she makes "night-night
" Now, can  please get 'em outta here before they really do something illegal
and in front of witnesses
178
-    - It's three o'clock in the morning
The corridors are empty as the elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy
Sorry  had to put you through that
know it was humiliating
It was awful
hated it
But you did save that man's life
- 124 - Yeah, that was really nice of me
'm a nice person
just wish had the strength to go to his room and break his spine
On the last day of filming the queen decides to come out of the closet
Wouldn't that have made a lovely headline
You understand, of course, that the film would've been destroyed
Doing that to me
Eli, what's wrong
Nothing serious
Just a little self-indulgence
Feel-sorry-for- Eli-time
Eli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears
(') 'm sorry, but you know
it's too goddamn much
Why's everybody on my back
When's somebody gonna say, "There, there Eli
" 'm really surrounded by friends, allies and you
"What else can  do for your film, Eli
" (wounded) That's not fair
They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his separate way
They stop
What's not fair
getting my feelings "hurt
" When did  lose you to that soldier boy, Nina
That nice, wholesome, swell-looking kid
wanted by every cop, the and God knows who else, for God knows what crime
Nina is paralyzed with shock
- 125 - (') Come on, Nina, those blue eyes have bedazzled our little girl
For Christ's sake, he reeks of blood
You sound as crazy as
(she stops) (wryly) As who
He thinks you're trying to
(she can't say 'kill') harm him
Any number of people are trying to harm him
He walks off down the corridor
179
- Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves
In the cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases, pulling them aside, searching
Discovering one, he sets it on the floor
It's locked
With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and eagerly rifles the contents
Then, sensing a presence, he turns
There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him
With only a glance to her, he goes on with his search
How'd you know  was down here
The desk clerk
He finds a , opens it, getting to his feet triumphantly
How about that for luck
Burt's from Idaho
no picture on the driver's license
Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of suitcases
He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the - 126 - contents on the floor
Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket, stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple of work shirts, a heavy jacket
Passing a shelf of bayonets, he picks one out and throws it in the bag
(quietly) Who are you
(ignoring the seriousness) Name it
Above the bayonets are army helmets
He tries one on
(') Hey, how's this
World War One, uh
what did they call 'em
dogfaces
somethin'
doughboys
(flings a nurses uniform at her) Wanna be the nurse
179A   From some hospital props, he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward her
(') You tell me this wouldn't work
pretty nurse pushing a vet in a wheelchair
When we hit that roadblock, we'd have 'em crying like babies
(quietly) Who the hell are you
Somebody trying to stay alive
anybody--that can get past the dogs and the quicksand
(making a shrewd guess) Who did Eli say  was
'm asking you, God damn
She has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder
- 127 - Easy with that tatoo
it mighta lost me Eli, but it won me Lt
Emily Schmidt, the greatest boobs in Southeast Asia
and a very patriotic chick
So  got this tattoo, for 28 bucks
And when she saw this shoulder, let me tell ya, holy Jesus
Following which  got the clap from the Lt
And hepatitis from the tattoo needle
You know what bothers me
think Emily is gonna be very offended by Eli's picture
Nina cannot endure another moment of this charade
Why do they want you
What did you do
Eli'd tell you
was a soldier did the same as everybody, just one of the boys
emptied my -16 at any sound
don't know whether killed gooks or cherries
the new kids from the States, we call 'em cherries, which they were for maybe fifteen minutes
The dry season is when it really breaks loose
You get very tired
It's like falling asleep at the wheel
You close your eyes and it still goes on
You're killin' them, they're killin' you
Couldn't tell ya now what was real except 'm here
We sense in him the fatigue he is describing, then, pushing aside that memory
- 128 - (') Hey, once when things were rough and the grass ran out,  shot the hell out of a water buffalo
(he considers, then passes judgment on himself) Actually,  wasn't a bad soldier
better than most
Got lotsa pretty ribbons
Funny
sort of like when  did that first stunt and everybody started clapping
nothing like a slap on the back to ruin a man, blow his sense of proportion
So,  got home
and, uh
guess  expected something
Nothing fancy, but
something, you know
a free car wash, double blue chip stamps, extra time on the parking meter
don't know
Instead, people
uh, didn't seem too pleased
(trying to hide a lot of pain) In fact, they acted like  was gonna start killing babies
She crosses to him, deeply moved
(') Shit
was supposed to get married, run an ice cream parlor
(picks up his suitcases) gotta go
179B   Although they're standing only a couple of feet apart, he lifts his hand tentatively, as if to wave goodbye
What about the roadblocks
'll go through the woods
Don't you suppose there'll be cops in the woods
- 129 - suppose there are cops in the woodwork
But what the hell
it's a nice night
(he starts to go) Lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time, and Nina speaks out, unable to let him leave
've always liked the woods at night
They're very romantic
You can hunt for truffles
It might be such fun, we'd just keep going
Cameron can't afford to fall for her softness
You said "we
" What about your two scenes
That's true
One of them is three pages of me making a tunafish salad for an American flyer in 1917
And 've got to weigh that against losing the man  love
It's a big decision
Nina, you're making me crazy
'm sorry
'm a little crazy myself
can't let you go and don't even know who you are
(suddenly the dam bursts and all self-control is gone) Why are they chasing you
What have you done
What happens to me in the woods
Will  need a bayonet too
179C   He stands there, staring at her, his face suddenly savage
After everything, the lady is afraid of him
He picks up the duffel bag and moves for the door, then turns on her, punishing her with his words
- 130 - The charge was attempted murder bashed this cop's head in
It took the jury about two fucking minutes
It could of been worse
It could of been life
But the judge
he looked real nice at me, and said you were a damn good soldier, son
So he only gave me twenty years
No way
Enough
You know how long was in that prison -- nineteen months -- and then  was gone was gone
She stares in shock and horror
His anger is like ice
(') Caught me breaking into a store
oh, not to rob it
went there to kill the bastard who owned it
Why
Because
179D   Suddenly the ice turns to steam
His self-control shatters like glass
There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an audience of one, Cameron , spewing out the memory of his mortification and crucifixion
not without the silent resignation of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog
Pluto with the rabies
(') Because
it seemed like a good idea to twist his fucking head off
Said  could be his partner when got back
lyin' son of a bitch was "real sorry things were slack
" Slack my ass
he just didn't want me hangin' around because he was bangin' my old lady
So  go down and start bangin' on his door
(he starts pounding on the mirror) - 131 - (') He's closed
It's two o'clock in the morning
want to smash his face in and he's closed
" , " 179E   Cameron's fist  his own face in the dressing table mirror
His reflection crazes and falls to pieces
(screaming) Your hand
Cameron holds up his fist to her, shaking it in glee
Bang
That bright, shiny front window went bye-bye
(reveling in his own insanity) Maybe he's screwin' her behind the counter
climb in there screamin' "
Come out here and be a man
Where are ya
Behind that counter, you son-of-a- bitch
" Cameron kicks over the makeup table as though it were the counter
tubes and glasses shatter all over the floor
(') Ya know what's behind that counter
(the ultimate horror) 41---- " and all that fuckin' 179F   There is a rainbow row of makeup jars and hair tints
He starts them against the wall where they smash, punctuating his speech with bursts of gooey color
(') And these little Mickey Mouse faces on the walls
with candy eyeballs
He pauses, catching his breath, as another image emerges from the swirl of memory
(') - 132 - (tense and frightened) Then
see this thing glowing in the dark
hit that floor so fast
Christ,  nearly swallowed my heart
That second  was sure
it was Charlie
a cigarette butt, some guy on a
Patrol
(his panic subsides) Know what it was
It was the That did it
That Me buried in shit, being the damn good soldier the judge said  was, yes sir, people sitting there on their fat asses feedin' their fat faces
"Can have an extra cherry
Can  have an extra cherry
" Cameron rips Denise's electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it across the basement
(') smashed that fucking fudge pot across the room, smack into that shelf full of animals
and it starts raining pussycats and monkeys and kangaroo cookies like Noah's Ark
The   hair dryer smashes against a shelf, toppling ammunition boxes and   bottles onto the carcass of a disassembled World War  airplane
The   propeller topples and falls through a German recruiting poster, and   just out at the Kaiser's crotch
(') "How long should a girl wait" she says
, , '
Cameron's hands have come to rest on a metal laundry bin
He grips it and lifts it over his head
(') picked up this fifty-pound ice cream vat
---
---
and started running with that son-of- a-bitch
179G - 133 - Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to hurl it, he  with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on his back
The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon cascade on top of him
It looks disastrous
Nina runs to him, terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing and screaming as he struggles to his feet
At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing
But Cameron, who has somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin, screaming: (') With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had stepped in oil
In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on his ass in the green goo
Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable guffaw
(bellowing) It's not funny
Shamed, Nina runs to him
Oh, baby
But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on her ass
His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a fiendish, uncontrollable cackle
These pratfalls are a catharsis that has released the pressure and the madness
They attempt to gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint
He succeeds, but Nina fails
(through laughter) Let me go to the bathroom
'm gonna have an accident
- 134 - You'll miss the main part
Killer Cameron's ghastly crime
was freaked out of my head
And, suddenly there's this big flashlight shining in my face
just grabbed that goddamn ice cream bucket and slopped it
right over the guy's head
Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina
Her hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing
(') (quietly) It's not funny
It wasn't him
It was a cop
got out of there like a shot
didn't know he was knocked out
How the hell did know he was gonna lay there all night with his head in the ice cream
(suddenly serious) Oh, my God
He died
No, he's in the hospital
Oh, no
Oh, yes
That ice cream's goddamn cold
(struggling for a proper description) His nose
it froze and his ear froze, see
and
Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling
She can't help it
(') (indignantly) No, it's terrible
He lost the tip of his nose and his ear lobe
- 135 - 179H   Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too
Out of control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room
Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind her
(') 'll tell ya, it's a bad year to mess with cops
You get the screaming down on your ass
(through the door) Oh, God
Too late
Thanks a lot
Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone
The hilarity is over
He leans his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair
(softly) If we woke up Eli and told him about the ice cream
would he forgive me and call off the stunt
180
- - The   silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin waiting in the slumber room before services begin
Behind it, a side door of the garage opens
But it is not visitors coming to pay their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina
He is wearing Burt's clothes
Nina moves quickly to a   as Cameron crosses to the big overhead garage doors and hits the electric He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights illuminate the reality of the garage
Nina has started the convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles
How the hell d'ya open this thing
(
) Sorry, folks, it's locked
Nina gasps
Cameron whirls towards the voice
with a big flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them
- 136 - We know it's locked
Would you open up for us
Can't
not 'til seven o'clock
Mr
Cross's orders
(the actress) 'm sure Mr
Cross will understand when you tell him that Miss Franklin had a sudden desire for Swedish pancakes for breakfast and this gentleman had a sudden desire to keep me company
'm Nina Franklin, the star of the film
Pancake house don't open 'til eight
That's all right, we'll find some place
Town's closed up pretty tight this time of night
Then we'll drive to Cape Long
Ya'll never get through the roadblocks
Why not
Chief's orders
Mr
Cross didn't want any members of the company leavin' town tonight
Guess he wanted everybody good and rested for the last day
(he grins) Figure it's no secret about the Chief hopin' this is the last day
- 137 - (fiercely) Are you telling me that if  decide to take a drive at any time of the day or night or whenever  damn please,  need Mr
Cross's permission
Mr
Cross does not control me or anyone else, including this gentleman and he does not control the public roads
No, but the police do
'll wake Mr
Cross up and ask him if you want, but it's an awful hour
Should be somebody in the hotel kitchen by now
'll get 'em to rustle somethin' up for you
Maybe not pancakes, but eggs, if you want it
think the lady had her heart set on pancakes, but thanks
Okay
You change your mind, call
'll be around
He leaves
The officer is gone and so is their plan
They're in limbo
people in a waiting room whose flight has been cancelled
- 138 - can't believe it
He knows
The son-of-a-bitch knows whatever 'm thinking
'm beginning to feel like something that Sam wrote
'm not real
'm some jerk American flyer from World War  who has to go over a bridge and die because the goddamn script says so
It's crazy
'm trapped in his goddamn story
If somebody lost that page, 'd be fine
If he crossed it out and wrote something else like -- "At the last moment, he veers the big car from the railing--then goes speeding on to live happy ever after
" (he looks at the Duesenberg appraisingly, then grins as a plan starts to form) How about that
Empty road, me out there all alone, the crew 'way back, breathless as  approach the bridge
And then
"Hey, what happened
"  fucking rewrite's what happened
'll have a fifteen- minute jump on them before they figure out they're shooting a new version
Nina has come to life, her eyes aglow like a shrewd little girl who's already decided how the fairy tale will end
And what about the love story
What happens to the Austrian girl
People will leave the movie feeling terrible
know
She goes with him
How
Nina has walked around to the back of the Duesenberg and opens the In here
- 139 - (cautiously) Not bad
But,  think they arrange to meet later
like in a Greyhound Bus station a couple of towns away
No
look
(she climbs in) See how big it is
Comfortable, too
Honestly, honey, it's a better ending
(firmly) Nina, get out of the trunk
The pretending has ended
And what happens in the morning
Do show up on the set in my little pink pinafore and say, "Hi, Eli
Where's my hug and kiss
" How do do that now
(sternly) Get out of the trunk
Or should  trot up to my room to catch a couple of winks and cuddle up with a dozen sleeping pills
(angry) It's my nightmare
Stay out
This isn't the time to solve your neurotic problems
'm trying to stay alive
(shouting back) So am
And  never claimed not to have "neurotic problems
" (interrupting) Oh, for Christ's sake
- 140 - They come with the body
It's all one
package deal
The shouting ends
and in despairing silence,  of approaching are heard, grumbling that the coffee's late
(urgent whisper) Nina, please, there's somebody coming
Get out of the trunk
As we glimpse the  in the doorway, she reaches up, grabs the inside of the trunk lid and pulls it down, disappearing from sight, as the trunk slams shut
181
- In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones of the abandoned road
The ancient bridge spans the black river, idling toward the sea
It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness
As it grows louder and , a flock of birds is frightened from the trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll from the vibration
Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession
Long, short, tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads, its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee
In the midst of these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the coffin on its caisson
The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the
, astride the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints
- 141 - All right, people
the rest period is over
Another fifteen minutes and we start losing sun
Come on, let's get the equipment off those trucks
The Second
's run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers, snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric horns
(') Chuck
Chuck Barton, where do you want the Duesenberg
Grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush into the hills
(') Mr
Cross, please
The camera crew's ready for a setup
182 They are already huddled, squatting on their haunches under a tree
The -35 in the chopper on the maxi- mount, the underwater Imo in the Duesenberg
'll hide an Arri with a zoom up on the hill
And what about number four
Maybe hang a platform under the bridge with the speed camera
(admiringly) Heavy
From the top of the screen right into the water
squish
183 Being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road
Crewmen swarm; in and under it, tuning, polishing, testing, installing camera, sound, electrical equipment, as Chuck hovers over them
- 142 - All drivers, please
want every equipment vehicle back behind the bend
As motors rev, the two sheepdogs squawk: "Out of sight
" "Behind the bend
," then are lost in the rising dust of their herd
184 Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road, snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles, strangling the landscape
(pointing at the mike boom) What's that supposed to be, Ralph
An elm or an oak
Get that mike off the boom and into the bushes
Come on, people, let's think
We're losing the sun
185 Gabe, Chuck, the
and a Technician move down the road toward us, shoulder to shoulder, halting on the bridge
Chuck and Gabe move to the stone railing
Chuck taps on it, producing a hollow sound
Gabe, examining a corner of this false section
(to
) Have 'em touch up that corner of the section
It looks phony as hell
The
has been drawing a chalk line across the road
(to Technician) Climb down there in the bushes and stay out of sight
What about earphones
Just watch your mark
- 143 - 186 Behind it, the last of the equipment trucks is being jack-knifed out of sight
row of reflectors stand like sentinels on the hill, bathing the Duesenberg in light
Workmen swarm about it like ants on the queen's birthday
187 (into walkie-talkie) Where's the chopper
We'd kinda like to have you join us
if you can find the way
(over walkie-talkie) Fifteen minutes, Eli
We're just warming her up
Eli grabs an electric horn from the hand of a passing
All right, everybody
may  have your attention, please
Instantly the frantic
's begin squawking, "Everybody put down what you're doing, the director wants to talk
" (thru speaker) This is the one and only Duesenberg we have in stock
When that car goes into the water, we're not going to see it again
So, once the action starts, no matter what happens, keep it going
188 As Cameron steps out through the open doorway, buttoning his costume
(') We must have this shot
Therefore,  now order no camera to jam and no cloud to pass before the sun
- 144 - 189 As Cameron moves toward it uncertainly
Eli, some distance away, surrounded by members of his crew, glances up
(yelling) How ya doin', soldier
Where'd ya learn to do without sleep
Without awaiting an answer, Eli returns to his work, as Cameron approaches the Duesenberg
190 Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving relentlessly toward the humpback trunk
horn honks and a police car slides up
Jake leans out the window, waves at Cameron jovially
How do you guys get accident insurance
Must cost you an arm and a leg
(chuckling) that's a good one
He drives on toward a parked German army truck, in which lounge several soldiers
Chuck approaches Cameron
You're lookin' real strong, kid
Is that loose change  hear jinglin' or are they beginnin' to grow
(flatly) Wanna check
'mon, lemme show you this truck
They walk towards the German truck
(') 'm sending it on ahead
During the gag, it's gonna be comin' down the road towards you when you get to the bridge
Cameron tenses at this information
- 145 - (') Relax, what does it change
'm only tellin' you so you don't buzz off into space when you see 'em
They'll be shooting at you and that's what's supposed to make you go into the river
190A   They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly
The Property Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German soldiers, whom we now recognize as police officers from the town
One cop, tying his shoe, lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night
Hey, you ever get those pancakes
My boys
Can't recognize 'em
How could  say no, after all the crap they've taken because of this company the last six weeks
(good-naturedly) Yeah, a cop'll do anything for fifty bucks, even be an actor
These guns are kinda modern for World War
(to Chuck) You want me to drive back and get the old ones
(deciding) Shit
forget it
How much'll they see from the helicopter
If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt, he is now really unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns
The second cop is loading cartridges
- 146 - (starting back to Duesenberg) Hope those are really blanks
(chuckling) Don't say so on the box
191     ' As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then gently taps
He must get Nina out of there
With determination, he reaches for the trunk handle
Arms wearing the same costume as his own reach in, holding the trunk closed
It is Raymond
No need to look
If she loves you, she's still there
If she doesn't
then it doesn't really matter
does it
How can he know
-- Everything is out of control -- a voice calls
' Hey, Lucky, we need you
He turns and moves numbly to the car door
(') Get in, will ya
Dazed, Cameron climbs behind the wheel
192 (') (leaning in passenger's side) Look straight ahead, can you see that red light out of the corner of your eye
tiny red light is mounted in the corner over the windshield
(') That'll let you know when the film's running, so be sure you don't turn your face to the camera
- 147 - The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning back out of the car, yells
(') All right, bump it once
(to Cameron) Does it work
Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response
Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation
(') (yells
) Bump it again
(looks back into the car) (by reflex) What
The words " " sound exactly like "
" It sounded as though his real name was called and he automatically answered
Has his identity been exposed
His eyes widen
The technician, getting no response, calls to Jake
Ask him if it's on
Cameron
He whirls to see Jake staring at him
His hand darts to the ignition key, the engine roars to life
(') (startled) Hey, they wanna know is the Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic
In his mind, he's given himself away
The road ahead is clear --
He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor
The Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly
In its wake -- chaos
Everyone running, yelling
(yelling) That crazy bastard
Who cued him
- 148 - Not me
(cold; urgent) Roll
Roll the film
Move your asses --  want that shot
At their master's voice, they leap
(screams) End markers
(shouts) Speed
193 Speed
The needle hits sixty-five -- seventy -- climbing fast
Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road
An involuntary shout swells up and escapes his mouth
(exultantly) Yahooo
(toward Nina in the trunk) Hang on to everything, baby, we're on our way
You okay
The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five
Ahead, the bridge is rushing toward us
Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past
Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped
Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended
Suddenly the red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins whirring
He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up, (recalling that moment in the tower): (screaming) Shoot this, Eli
The center of the bridge is an instant away, an approaching blur
194
- Crouching -- tensely watching the chalk line on the road as the Duesenberg flashes past
His finger presses a button
195 - - 149 - Blam
The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive charge
196 The Duesenberg drops on one axle
Metal screams against stone, as though it were Cameron himself, screaming
Skidding, spinning, tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward like a dying bird
197
- cry of such anguish and despair
(screaming) Ninaaa-a-a-a-a-
198
- The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening, shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera and Cameron's desperate cries
Tearing his seatbelt off he flings himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to reach Nina
Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is buoyed to the surface
There, again, is the living world - the road, the trees
In that brief instant, through the rear window, Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina, standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her
The car noses downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window
The last image on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on Nina's face
Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom
Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is total
Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this -- red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his death
- 150 - Outrage galvanizes him to action
He reaches for the door handles, to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands
Now there is a rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode, crushing down toward him
Under the immense pressure, the rear window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent
The memory of Chuck's voice
"the windows
" He lowers the front window slowly
The water now pours in faster
The level has risen to his chin
He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head
Still the red light burns
He reaches beneath the seat for the oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose
It won't move
The impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame
His groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask
hope
Though every second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are as in slow motion
Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager breath and chokes as water fills his mouth
The rubber tube has broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must have with Burt
Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the water reaches the roof
For a moment there is a strange stillness which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and toward the surface
199 Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in a desperate race to reach air
Daylight
Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms to stay afloat
Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore
His muscles, still moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the fugitive, the "man on the run
" Then, he lifts his head and stops at what he sees before him: 200 Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready
Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron
201 It's over
Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as though his eyes were made of glass
They see him now, but their pace doesn't change
As they take the last few steps toward him, he sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet around him
Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him brutally about
Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a- - 151 - bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut it
" He feels a blow on the back, then another
They seem too gentle
Why is that cop smiling
Some of them are walking away
Where are the handcuffs
Why is he shaking my hand instead
Then the jumble of voices is becoming clearer
"No matter what they pay you, make 'em give you a raise
"
"Fantastic, my wife thinks being a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific
" It finally sinks in, the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned
He is alive and free
Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle
Then it chokes into laughter
202 Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag filled with elastic bandages
How funny
Here's the helicopter hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli, who runs to meet him
How hilarious
There's the pink pinafore
Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades through the tall grass towards him
How sweetly absurd
All right, come on
let's get the stuff in the trucks, we're losing sun
203 Chuck has reached Cameron, throwing a blanket over him
He pulls a pint from his back pocket
Take a belt
Don't be stingy
As Cameron tilts his head back, the bottle to his mouth, he sees skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of their dripping wet-suits
Those guys down there the whole time
Chuck, who is rubbing Cameron violently through the blanket to restore his circulation, replies with the highest compliment he can pay
can't hear ya
they're clangin' too loud
- 152 - 204 Nina has reached an impasse twenty yards away in her journey of love toward Cameron -- a muddy section of swamp
(shouts across the distance to Cameron) can't come any further
What should  do
'll get the dress all muddy and  need it for the next scene
(grinning with good nature) Tunafish salad
know
(shouts) They found me five minutes after you left
felt ridiculous
(waves back) Just as well
(shouts) When Eli told me you'd   changed your mind and decided to do   the stunt, at first  didn't believe   him, but guess you really did
tried to find you
Eli is standing nearby listening to this macabre exchange between lovers
(') (to include Eli) 'm sure glad you two made up
Boy, Lucky, were you wonderful
guess have to go now
See you after
She awkwardly turns, her dress still held high and yells back over her shoulder
(') - 153 - 'm sorry  was so nutty last night
always get crazy at the end of a film
Nina continues picking her way toward the road
And then
205 Suddenly she turns, running headlong, pell-mell across the swamp and through the mud holes, drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag, losing a shoe, ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of Cameron, smearing him with love and mud
And then, just as quickly, she is gone, racing back across the field, hopping like a rabbit without her shoe, toward the road
206 Cameron is brimming with pleasure
Chuck, totally ignored, picks up his stunt bag
(dryly) Lover,  think your circulation's back to normal
And please, next time will ya listen for the cue -- the word is "action
" He walks off, leaving Cameron draped in the blanket like an Indian
Eli steps up to him looking very serious, lifts his hand in the Indian sign of greeting and says: "How
"  have always had a great compassion for your people
Long before it was popular,  felt a repugnance for General Custer
Cameron stares at him, incredulous
(') My God,  think he's breathing
There're days  can't do anything right
hope this doesn't screw up our relationship, your being alive and all
- 154 - (shaking his head) You sure took a hell of a chance, Eli
why didn't you just let me go last night
What, with Nina in the trunk
've got scenes to shoot with her
All right
This morning then
Chuck could have done the stunt
(thoughtfully) knew a guy who made an anti-war film
When they previewed it in his hometown, army enlistment went up six hundred percent
'm making this film trying to convince the whole world that maybe there's a better way to get home for Thanksgiving
and  can't even convince one dumb kid with a tattoo
couldn't have you run around paranoid the rest of your life thinking  was trying to kill you
Paranoid
Sam has run up, out of breath, followed by crew members
Hey Sam, the kid just licked your screenplay
He named the disease
Yeah, what
a social disease, very common
like gonorrhea
- 155 - You're close
It's spread the same way
by screwing your fellow man
hope you find an easier cure
That was the hardest thousand bucks ever made
horn honks
It is Jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron
You guys want a ride back
(moving toward the helicopter) No, we're goin' in the chopper
(considers it) Thanks, Eli, but that looks too dangerous
think 'll ride with Jake
Good luck with the picture
He moves toward police car
(yelling to Cameron) Don't miss that plane, Burt
(leaning across Cameron to yell at Eli) He better not
Any member of your company found within city limits after five o'clock tonight, gets shot on sight
Eli stops, suddenly registering what Cameron had said
What thousand bucks
That stunt paid six-fifty
(surprised) Chuck told me a thousand
- 156 - (firmly) Six-fifty
(getting upset) thousand
(relenting) Okay, seven-fifty
Split the difference
Bullshit
You're trying to screw me
(exasperated) Christ
You're doing it again
(striding toward the chopper, shouting) Sam
This paranoid little bastard still doesn't understand your damn screenplay
Eli is climbing into the helicopter
(shrieking) That's your big problem, Eli
You use people
want my money, a thousand bucks
(to Cameron) Six-fifty
(to Sam) Rewrite the battle scene and let the tank run him over
The stunt pays six-fifty
The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it
Come back here
'm tired of being your goddamn clown
Pay me my thousand bucks
Eli's voice on the helicopter's
speaker echoes through the canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away
- 157 - '  (
) How tall was King Kong
