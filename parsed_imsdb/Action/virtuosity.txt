Hunters hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle
The sidewalk is crowded with people
So is the street
Too many people, not enough cement
Los Angeles, 1997
Summer, probably August
103 degrees
Heat shimmers off the horizon
Making the sky look peculiar
The men keep running
Passed a  sitting at a bus stop, watching a television in his lap
the
(

) As
officers gather evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes
(a beat) The three adjectives which best describe this killer are sadistic, intelligent, and dangerous
The guy pays little attention to the broadcast
He seems almost bored by it
Like this kind of news is commonplace
Or he's got more important things on his mind
Everybody is sweating
Including the two men struggling to swim upstream in the river of pedestrians
Their uniforms are freshly pressed
Their shoes just recently shined
Hair tightly cropped
Faces perfectly shaved
Clearly men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police Department
The guy in the lead is His body is a running back's
His endurance a marathoner's
His face one you'd want for your own
He's in his 30s
If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous
His partner is  , late 20s, eager to prove himself
He struggles to keep up with Parker
John accidently knocks over several pedestrians
They give no reaction, except to pick themselves up and continue on their way
Parker and John keep charging
Their conversation breathless: can't get over how different you look
(ruefully) Five years can be a bitch, huh
They split-up
The Maitre ', still facing the front doors, repeats his greeting to no one in particular
' Good afternoon
May  help you
Parker spots Sid 6
7 across the room
Without hesitation the hunter chases his prey
Gun out and firing
what you would call Standard Police Procedure
Bullets riddle Sid 6
7's table as he dives from his chair
He lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his table
John charges from the other direction until a  gets up from her chair, standing directly in John's line of fire
(to the Woman) Lady, move
Before she can do so, Sid 6
7 stands behind the Woman, grabbing her and throwing her across the table into Parker
They tumble to the floor
In the same movement, Sid 6
7 removes a gun from inside his jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire
John's gun flies from his hand
Sid 6
7 advances toward him
Parker struggles to his feet
Aims his weapon
Sid 6
7 does the same, but without looking
Parker gets a bullet through his shooting arm
His wound  to John's
Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp
Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6
7 brutally kicks him in the stomach
In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in the background
Parker doubles over, gasping for breath
Another kick drops Parker to his knees
6
7 (to Parker) 'm going to rehearse with your friend a while, then 'll be back to perform a new piece with you
He grabs his bowling bag and  it into John's head, knocking him out
Sid 6
7 puts John's unconscious body over his shoulder
6
7 (') If you get hungry, 'd recommend the escargot
They're delicious
He carries John and the bowling ball bag into the kitchen
Parker scrambles to his gun, and races after Sid 6
7
Parker charges through   chopping vegetables, who work undistracted
The Vegetables look plastic
Parker turns a corner, stopping fast
At the other end of the aisle stands Sid 6
7, who presses his gun against the head of a frightened
Sid 6
7 holds the Busboy's body in front of his own as a shield
(to Sid 6
7) Where's John
6
7 Performing solo
(a beat) Enjoying the concert so far
Advancing up the aisle, Parker levels his gun at Sid 6
7 with his good arm
Now, all work comes to a stop as the Sous Chefs watch the showdown
Recital's over, asshole
He fires directly through the chest of the innocent Busboy hitting Sid 6
7
The Sous Chefs gasp in horror as the Busboy drops through Sid 6
7's grasp to the floor
Dead
Sid 6
7 stares at Parker in disbelief
Blood is now visible flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6
7's shoulder, which was caused by the same bullet
Sid 6
7's arm dangles uselessly
His gun lies on the floor
6
7 (surprised, but pleased)
You and me aren't so different, after all
Parker again pulls the trigger
Click
Click, click
No bullets
6
7 (') Like a violin without strings
He takes off around the corner
Grabbing another clip from inside his uniform, Parker goes after him
Only to stumble over something
Sid 6
7's bowling bag
Blood flows through its zipper
You now realize the object inside is  a bowling ball
Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing
His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire
John is being electrocuted
Parker kicks away the wires, but not in time
He scans the room for Sid 6
7
Parker has no idea Sid 6
7 is standing directly behind him
Sid 6
7 grabs Parker by the throat
6
7 told you  was going to perform a new piece with you
It's called, "First You Suffer, Then You Die
" Hope you like it
Parker gags, unable to breathe
He then starts to from within Sid 6
7's grasp
6
7 (') (as if to God) You can't take him, yet
'm not finished
John's body also dematerializes as Parker disappears entirely
The blood seeping from Sid 6
7's wound stops flowing and starts retracting into his body
Along with his bone fragments
His shoulder is healing itself
Right before your very eyes
We     what you are seeing is The scene continues seamlessly
Sid 6
7's skin heals over his shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their proper places
No scar whatsoever
His clothing also returns to perfect condition
Literally, as good as new
This is known as
The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets
His wound healing by itself
We    to reveal the monitor is one of several a/k/a
The facility is a converted aerospace research building in Pacoima
Funded by government black book dollars
The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech sparkle
Banks upon banks of computer equipment
Wires, cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look
In complete disarray to the uninitiated
But to those in the know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the world
The building is partitioned into dozens of stations
At each station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically readying a prototype for demonstration
Each new technology designed to help fight the new Cold War
the War on Crime
The atmosphere is competitive
Voices are loud
Tension, anticipation in the air
Only a lucky few will have their inventions approved for production
is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from 1994
At a station in the middle of the room, lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps made of polyurethane
Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it at points designated as neural primes
Each needle is directly connected to the participant's nervous system
The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers surrounding the beds
Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own
But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of something very new  a revolutionary law enforcement training device whose name you read: To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed involving Parker, John, and Sid 6
7 took place within virtual reality, not the real world
Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into
the system's main console
Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as ' 1
7 and  3
2
There is no character version number greater than 4
0
Until you see the module labelled  6
7
The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11 seconds
clock reads: 3:04:32
Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality monitors positioned around the station
One of the men wears an
uniform
His name is  , 40S
His nameplate reads
One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor
Intently following the action on screen
Studying it clinically
Her name is
, late 30s
She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a back seat to her intelligence
She is one of the country's foremost authorities on criminal psychology
Her concerns are empirical
Her quest is knowledge
She has little in common with the other observers
The other man is  , 5Os, Chairman/ of Expensive suit
Commanding, powerful
But not as commanding, or powerful, as  , 605, the Presidentiallyappointed Crime Czars Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated to
As well as which prototypes will move on to production
(quietly to Wallace) What did Cox pull him out early for
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember
(a beat) Don't remind me
remove the polyurethane skull caps from the two unconscious bodies
The acupuncture needles remain in the caps
You can now see the faces of the participants: Parker and John
Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually returns to consciousness
He looks very different than his virtual rendering: His hair is long and ragged
His face is unshaven
scar across his cheek
hoop earring in one ear
His outfit a filthy prison uniform
John's outfit matches Parker's
Physically, he looks as cleancut as his virtual rendering
Except that he is convulsing
Violently
His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around him
Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure
It's ugly
Frightening
(barely conscious) burst through the doors and rush to John
The paramedics inject him
Fibrillate him
Repeatedly
The simulator's designer,  , 40s, high strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the equipment protectively
He is far more concerned for the safety of his machines than he is for John's life
John's body goes limp
His vital signs flat
The Paramedics record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet
They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out
(annoyed to Wallace) What the hell happened
(pointing to needles) Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system
If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of  is like experiencing death within a dream
The experience becomes real
(angrily) Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world
(annoyed, to Lindenmeyer) was assured the problem was corrected
did fix it
told you  did don't know why it happened again
Again
(a beat) My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate
(coldly, to Wallace) Why wasn't  told
Black book dollars, black book operation
You pay me for results, not how for how  get you there
(to Deane) 'll tell you one thing - there is no way in hell we should allow any real officers to train in this damn thing
Then about all 've spent $37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population
After giving Wallace a cold, hard stare -- namely at his hand stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded cufflinks, she exits
Wallace follows after her quickly
You now notice that the chair Dr
Madison Carter had occupied is now empty
She left a while ago
Cox remains
Lindenmeyer hurriedly examines the simulator as if it were his child
There are several scratches, but no major damage
He looks relieved
(struggling to sit up) He
only had a year left on his sentence
(annoyed) How much do you think  care
Parker, still not fully conscious, hurls himself at Lindenmeyer
(' ) (hysterical) Don't touch me
'
He flails his arms wildly
Nearly spasming
This is clearly a man who should never drink coffee
armed , who've been standing in the background, pull Parker off Lindenmeyer and throw him to the ground
Lindenmeyer watches with satisfaction as the guards put Parker in handcuffs and leg chains
'll walk him out
The Guards back off as Cox helps Parker to his feet
(') (to Parker) You all right
(still clearing his head) Why'd
you pull me out
Donley started experiencing the attack for real
If  hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you
(a beat) You may not believe this, Parker, but  still consider us friends
He helps Parker toward the exit as he continues having difficulty with his balance
The building is heavily-guarded
Razor wire, land mines, armed sentries
Nobody who shouldn't be here gets anywhere near here
Cox leads Parker by the arm to a waiting prison transport
The two guards walk behind at a distance
Two more by the transport
The chain between Parker's legs keeps his steps short
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for
He was a computer program for crissake
You were supposed to act as if everything was real
Real, my ass
It's an overblown game
(a beat) Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6
7 to take a shot at him
Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first
(eyeing Parker's scar) New scar  you making it okay in there
(head down) 'm getting by
He starts walking ahead of Cox
Distancing himself
(pausing for emphasis) ) You've got to know  tried keeping you out of general population
Goddam politicians
His voice trails off as Parker turns around, and heads directly toward him
(locking eyes) You want to know how 'm doing
Every day,  lose a little bit more of myself
(a beat) 'm becoming something else, and it scares the hell out of me
He turns back toward the transport
Cox follows
Two armed open the back doors for Parker, then stand poised with weapons out and ready
-- Cold metal benches
No windows
Parker climbs in, the only passenger
He looks out the open doors to Cox
(half-heartedly) But with the six months off  get for being your guinea pig, 've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days
Don't give up, Parker
Not ever
(a beat) You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year
What about them
(a beat) Do me a favor  keep sending them
Standing outside the transport, Cox puts his hand on Parker's shoulder
Take care, pal
Behind him, John's body is loaded into an ambulance
The Guards  the prison transport doors shut
-- Parker sits in  as the transport begins its trek
The only light comes from a four inch portal, covered in steel mesh, through which the Guards can keep an eye on him
(tauntingly) Hey Parker  'm real sorry John boy got fried
What do you think Big Red's gonna do when he finds out you came back without his girl friend
Parker sits in silence
: Sid 6
7 remains visible on the various monitors around the room as Lindenmeyer spot checks the simulator
6
7 (from the monitors) Don't be angry with me, Daryl
(a beat) Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away
6
7 Should  have
Think hard -- it'll come to you
Wallace enters briskly
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country
(a beat) Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr
Barnes is still breathing
'm still making adjustments
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer
(moving closer) ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances
Neither do
You're fired
(hysterical) '
(relishing his authority) You are to turn over the Sid 6
7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction
Is that understood
(restraining himself) understand
understand perfectly
Wallace ignores him as he walks toward the door
On the monitors, Sid 6
7 starts walking toward you
Into a
6
7 (from the monitor) Hey, Wallace, you really think you can shut me down
Wallace stops, staring at a monitor in disbelief
(to Lindenmeyer) How does he know who  am
(pointing to microphone) He hears
everything
(approaching the monitor) As a matter of fact,  do
He exits
around the room, Sid 6
7 walks to a pay phone and dials a number
Wallace walks toward the building's entrance
His footsteps His cellular phone
This is Wallace
6
7 (
0
) (through phone) As a matter of fact, little man, you're wrong
think, therefore, am
Click
Sid 6
7 hangs-up
Wallace stops, staring at his phone in disbelief
: Parker is led into the Inmate Receiving Room at gunpoint
He is ordered to remove his clothing
He stands completely naked, arms held out to the sides, as he is strip searched
Every portion of the body in which someone could hide something is closely inspected
Without being graphic, we watch the dehumanizing procedure
He opens his mouth as wide as possible
Pulls his earlobes foreword to reveal behind them
Then bends over, hands on the floor in front of him
He is scanned with a metal detector
So is his clothing, which is then returned to him
#1 Welcome home, cop
: Parker eats at a table with a dozen other inmates
The food is unrecognizable
The air thick with humidity and cigarette smoke
Nobody is talking
Just staring
At Parker
Parker forces down the remainder of his meal, then returns his utensils to a bin
And heads to the bathroom
All eyes following Parker's every move
The other inmates then turn their attentions to a man of incredible size following Parker
6' 6", 255 lbs
His face covered with red scar tissue from burns suffered long ago
This is
He follows Parker into the bathroom
Graffiti covers the walls
Red uses a stained urinal, then turns to the stalls
pair of prisonissue shoes and socks are visible beneath one of them
Time to hurt
Red kicks in the door to the stall
Revealing a pair of shoes and socks stuffed with a prison shirt
Red hears something behind him
And turns around slowly
Parker stands barefooted and shirtless
are visible around each arm just below the elbow
You will learn what these represent momentarily
Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red
But the punch Parker delivers to Red's face makes you think it's the other way around
You  the sound of metal crushing bone
Red is thrown backwards into the stall
Blood splatters from his mouth, adding another shade of redness to his face
Red's teeth stick out of Parker's fist
Parker pulls out the teeth
He does not bleed
Nor seem in pain
Metal is visible beneath the surface of his skin
For the first time, you notice   on the outsides of his palms
They read:   17-, and 17-, followed by serial numbers
Red charges Parker wildly
Parker dodges him like a matador does a bull
Then brings his fists down savagely on the back of Red's head
His skull
Red drops to the floor
Parker jumps on top of him, arms around his neck
Choking him
Red staggers to his feet
His eyes wide
His face now even redder
Parker maintains his mechanical grip
Red finally succumbs to the lack of oxygen
He drops to his knees
Parker does not relent until he feels the barrel of a gun at the back of his head
Fun's over
Parker lets go, dropping Red to the wet, filthy floor
: The room isn't clean
The technology is outdated
large, female  applies epoxy-like sealant to the synthetic skin on Parker's fingers
still don't know why they wasted this fancy, new technology on you
Every time  fix you up, you only go and mess it up again
She sandpapers off the excess sealant
Then places his elbow into an electronic sensitivity adjuster
Tell me how this feels
She pricks Parker's finger with a pin
(smiling) 'll dial it down a little
She does so, then pricks Parker's finger again
He grimaces in pain
(') That about right
It'll never feel right
At least they work
Would you rather have no hands at all
Sometimes
: lying strewn around one of the stations in  the
It's a good bet this is the same technology attached to Parker's elbows
There are also various shapes and sizes of robots, androids, and other synthetic forms
The most humanlooking ones are the least functional
The least humanlooking ones, the most functional
You follow a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry moving swiftly through an obstacle course resembling a subway station
It is being operated by  , 20s, a hardware genius who has spent too much time in windowless rooms
Hidden from Reilly's view, Lindenmeyer, the software expert who created Sid 6
7, stares jealously through a narrow gap in a partition
Trying to contain his anger
And failing
Especially as
Wallace enters the station, carrying a bottle of Dom Perignon and two glasses
Wallace hugs Reilly, who does not return the gesture
Congratulations, Reilly
He pops the cork, and pours their glasses
(') (toasting) To the first  engineer to go into production on prototypes
As long as you keep overpaying me, 'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well
As long as they keep overpaying me, 'll keep overpaying you
(dropping the revelry) ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month
Mr
Wallace,  could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow
(a beat) Do they have to look so
robotic
At this stage, you either get form or function
You said she wanted function
gave you function
What are you complaining about
He remote controls the robotic sentry to chase Wallace out of the station
Lindenmeyer can no longer be seen through the gap in the partition
' Lindenmeyer storms in angrily
Sid 6
7 is visible on the virtual reality monitors around the simulator
He's giving himself a manicure
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity
6
7 True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime
(a revelation) It was you, wasn't it
6
7 (innocently) It was me, what
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you
(angrily) You're the reason the convict died
You're the reason  got fired
6
7 couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty
'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive
(proud, but frightened) My God
6
7 Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you
(a beat) In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away
But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here
6
7 had something a little different in mind
(deviously) Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours
Lindenmeyer arches an eyebrow, then picks up a phone and dials an extension
(into phone) Hey, Reilly, Sheila 3
2's been asking for you
: whose wrists and ankles are cuffed, being led into a Prison Interrogation Room
Dr
Madison Carter sits at a table, a '  clipped to her suit
notepad in front of her
(to the Guard) The cuffs won't be necessary
No offense, ma'am, but  don't think that's such a good idea
would like the following three things in this order: your mouth shut, his cuffs off, and your ass outside the door
Any questions
The Guard removes Parker's cuffs, then exits, taking up his post outside the door
The skin around Parker's wrists is blue where the cuffs dug into his skin
Parker sits across from Madison
She places a microrecorder in the middle of the table and presses
You actually listen to all those tapes
(wryly) No,  just like the effect a tape recorder has on you
(a beat) How you feeling today
little less than yesterday
In other words, par for the course
(a beat) How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday
John died
know
was there
saw the whole thing
(a beat) If  was your therapist,  would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation
You're not my therapist
You're hear to study me
Face it  'm nothing more than a lab rat to you
That's not true, Parker
If  had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if  carry any genetic predisposition toward violence
(a beat) What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy
Not much
He was just a computer program
Nothing more
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger
But  did
(a beat) You kind of liked it, didn't you
That thrill of going over the edge again
Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target
Go to hell
It was just like before, wasn't it
Wasn't it
(a beat) But you are making progress
Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved
Enough
The Guard pokes his head in with concern
The Guard quickly shuts the door
Madison turns to Parker
(') need to know what snapped in you
What made you capable of it
You have to make me understand
don't have to do anything except survive
And it's taking everything 've got just to do that
: inside Lindenmeyer's station in , the stunningly beautiful  3
2 appears
In very revealing lingerie
Performing an outrageous striptease
3
2 (seductively) hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me
Reilly runs his perspiring finger over the monitor as if he could touch the contours of Sheila 3
2's body
Oh, believe me, it is
It is
He is so aroused, he's shaking
Lindenmeyer, on the other hand, appears almost uninterested
He's used to the routine
On the monitor, Sheila 3
2 continues her striptease
Slowly
Sensually
Licking her lips
Grinding her hips
Putting on quite a show
She removes her top, revealing ideal breasts
She fondles her nipples
As well as the rest of herself
Lindenmeyer and Reilly continue watching
Reilly can barely control himself
Sheila 3
2 is very, very, very good at what she does virtuoso stripper
Reilly is transfixed
Until Lindenmeyer pushes a button,   the virtual reality screens
Show's over unless  get to see what you've been working on after hours
(paranoid) haven't been working on anything
(threateningly) Do  get to see it or not
(a beat) Bastard
(to a monitor) Sheila, don't go anywhere
'll be right back
He rushes out
Sid 6
7 appears on the various monitors next to Sheila 3
2
He kisses her cheek
Caresses her body
Sheila 3
2 enjoys the attention
6
7 She's some of your finest work, Daryl
All my work is my finest
Sid 6
7 continues appreciating Sheila 3
2
As Reilly races back in, the monitors then all go
Reilly, completely out of breath, holds a python by it's head
He dangles the snake right in front of Lindenmeyer's face
Terrifying him
(backing away fast) Get that fucking thing away from me
(laughing) You're
such a wimp
He grabs a large pair of scissors and snips right through the snake
The half of the snake which drops to the floor stops moving
But the half still in Reilly's hand begins  a new tail
Literally growing a new one
Lindenmeyer can't believe his eyes
He studies the snake closely
(') Watching your  people Auto Reset gave me the idea
(in awe) It's nanotechnology, isn't it
Machines the size of molecules
(proudly) Coordinated by polymer neural net
(touching the snake) It feels so
real
It's better than real
It's synthetic flesh
Synthetic blood
Synthetic organs
(a beat) It's a physiological machine
(awed) This is supposed to be years away
As far as the public is concerned, it is
The reason you got fired, and  got my second demo into production, is 'm a lot smarter than you
never give my best stuff away
(restraining himself) How do you kill it
Separate the character module from the neural net
Using Lindenmeyer's scissors, he cuts off the snake's head and removes a small character module connected to the base of the neural net
The snake stops moving
It "dies
" (') and you get nanodeath
(discarding the snake) Don't worry, 've got a bunch of other ones
Amazing
hate to say it, but it is
know
(a beat) 'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile
If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes
And bring the Sheila 3
2 character module with you
He exits
As Lindenmeyer reaches for the Sheila 3
2 character module, Sid 6
7 appears on the screen in front of him and winks
6
7 You catching my drift
think  understand what you have in mind
Peeling the label off the Sid 6
7 character module, Lindenmeyer removes the module from its slot
Sid 6
7 disappears from the screen
: opening his office door for Lindenmeyer fifteen minutes later
Reilly immediately double bolts the door behind him and leads Lindenmeyer through piles of electronic circuitry
As well as a large aquarium full of nanopythons
You need a maid
What  need is a nymphomaniac
He removes a tarp from a large, rectangular, metallic tank with a circular window in the middle of it
Clear, plastic tubing, which branches into hundreds of increasingly smaller and smaller branches, floats in electrified fluid
The tubing is a synthetic human nervous system
' Reilly turns to Lindenmeyer
Where's the Sheila 3
2 module
Lindenmeyer hands him the labelless character module
Reilly opens the "incubator
" Reilly inserts the module into the gelatinous base of the synthetic nervous system
The polymer neural net instantly crackles with life
It grows around the module
Cells (nanomechanisms) immediately begin adhering to the tubing
Forming the beginnings of a skeletal architecture
' Lindenmeyer and Reilly look on through the circular window
It feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid
(a beat) In eight hours, we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy
Off Lindenmeyer's wicked, but somewhat anxious, smile, we : ' It's night
Light is dim
His bed is empty
The wall next to it is completely bare, except for the five Christmas cards sent each year by Chief Cox
The other two walls in the cell, however, look very different
They are completely covered with primitive paintings  darkly colored, surreal images
Imagine the Lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress
Painted by Dali
Except these images were created by Parker Barnes
He kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image
Completely lost in concentration
His hands, his clothing, covered in paint
He almost appears to be part of the art work
The work is intricate
It clearly takes Parker a very long time
Which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep
Which is most of them
He is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts  throughout the cell block
Threats of the ugliest, most vile kind
The kind Parker has had to live with every night for the last five years
Pausing to admire his work, Parker finally hears the taunts
His face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger
Parker immediately resumes painting
: ' Reilly paces anxiously by the incubator eight hours later
Lindenmeyer sits off to the side, looking no less anxious
It's close to 4:00
There is no liquid left in the incubator -- it's all been absorbed
All that is visible is the silhouette of a human form crouched within steam
The form stands
' The human form inside incubator opens the hatch
Steam pours out from within its confines as it climbs out slowly
The figure stands within the mist, admiring itself
Then its surroundings
Reilly approaches the figure with the expectancy of a father about to see his newborn child for the first time

Lindenmeyer is nowhere to be seen
The office door is unlocked, and open
Watching Sid 6
7's expression, you realize something isn't quite right
His expression is exaggerated
Artificial
Only for a moment, but it's enough to remind you Sid 6
7 is not human
The billions of nanomechanisms which make up his anatomy are still learning to function in a fully-coordinated fashion
Sid 6
7 is, literally, getting used to his new skin
In various ways throughout his "life"  be it a wandering eye, or a momentary limp - you will be reminded that Sid 6
7 is a synthetic nanoorganism unlike anyone has ever seen
surgical knife by the aquarium catches Sid 6
7's attention
Picking up the knife, he runs his finger across the razor sharp knife blade
Cutting himself slightly

He then watches with interest as his wound regenerates, healing itself

Glancing at Reilly's prone body, he then  the office door in our face
: 6:00
Parker, clearly just awakened, is led into the room by a guard, who then exits
Waiting for Parker are Chief of Police Cox and Elizabeth Deane
(to Cox) You're wasting your time
'm not going to play any more of your goddam games
Parker Barnes, 'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane
(not shaking hands) It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial
You got any coffee
watched your simulation, Mr
Barnes
Very impressive
You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6
7 who is still alive
Only because  got pulled out early
Nobody else ever got anywhere near him
Nobody else
understands him like you do
Parker, looking at her incredulously, moves his index finger circularly, as in get on with it, already
Cox opens a folder and shows Parker several  of Reilly, or what was left of him
These were taken inside  an hour ago
Pretty pictures, aren't they
've seen worse
Name was Clyde Reilly
Hardware specialist

If you can catch him
Think you can do it
(a beat) Not from in here
(revealing a document) This is a full pardon
It authorizes your immediate release
She slides an unsigned pardon across the table to Parker, making sure to stay beyond his arm's reach
Cox reveals a worn,
badge
It was Parker's
Recognize this
How would you like your old job back
(to Parker) Catch him and your record's clean
What happens if  can't catch him
If Sid 6
7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence
How do you know  won't run
Deane holds up a small device called a
It is the size of a dime
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation
It's called a locater implant
Every parolee gets one

(leaning to Parker) If you try to run, 'll hunt you down and kill you myself
(a beat) Yes or no, Mr
Barnes
: being given a crew cut by an   inside the Prison Barber Shop
Long lengths of Parker's hair cover the floor
Parker's face is then shaved
The majority of his face is hidden
Cox and Deane look on
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer
Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you
But only you will know he's not human
Parker's expression is one of  yeah, that figures
Madison enters
She cannot see Parker behind the barber
Ms
Deane, you wanted to see me
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology
Under the authority vested in me by the President, 'm giving you temporary reassignment
What's the assignment
You're going to put your theories to practice
'm sending you into the field
The barber moves back from Parker, revealing his clean shaven face
It takes Madison a moment to recognize him with his cleanedup appearance
(double-taking him) Quite an improvement
(looking him over) Hair well above the collar standard,
regulation
(suspiciously to Deane) What exactly am  going to be doing in the field
: Parker lies on an operating table, receiving anesthesia, as a drills a small hole into his skull
The surgeon inserts a minute, fiber-optic camera into the hole
Parker's brain is displayed on a monitor
The surgeon uses the image to guide him as he carefully inserts the locater implant into Parker's brain
(looking at monitor) You are right on the border of his corpus callosuni
He is under, isn't he
(nodding) Won't stop him from dreaming, though
Parker's rapid eye movements tell you the anesthetist is correct
Parker is dreaming
Cox and Deane watch the operation through a large window
Madison enters, carrying a folder labelled:	 #673429 //
She withdraws several  from the folder, placing the first one in front of Deane
This is Parker Barnes six years ago
The most decorated cop in the history of
Special Investigations Division
The photograph is in black and white
But as we , it takes on color
As well as comes to life
Then distorting
Becoming surreal
Resembling one of the images from Parker's cell
Then mutating into something else
: ' darting about wildly beneath his eyelids as he continues dreaming
You now realize you are seeing what he is seeing: Flashes of color
Shapes
Mostly blurs
splash of gold
Along with some yellow
More images from Parker's cell

One adult, one child

Tears
Hopelessness
Detonation
And finally blackness
Complete and utter blackness
: looking at the fifth photograph which Madison has placed in front of her inside the Viewing Room
(unfazed) That's also where Mr
Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap
What's your point, Dr
Carter
(forcefully) Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse
At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator
The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous
Not if you're with him every step of the way
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives
He lost control and is capable of doing it again
understand the risks involved here
But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6
7 than Barnes
And, there is nobody who knows him better than you
If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it
have complete confidence in you
As Parker continues dreaming, the locater implant in his head is tested
Parker's location is pinpointed on an electronic map to within one inch of his present location
The hole in his skull is then stitched shut
: putting on his
uniform and badge inside a Prison Interrogation Room
He looks very much like he did in virtual reality, except for the scar on his cheek, and his empty holster
Cox and Madison look on
(to Cox) don't need a babysitter
What you need is a collar
(to Parker) She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6
7 tick
What she's going to do is get in my way
Cox hands Madison a thick folder
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer
There might be something in it you can use
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox
Fine  you want to stay here
His cellular phone , which he answers
As he listens to the call, his expression is one of growing concern
He clicks off the phone
(') Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple
completely gutted
(a beat) So were the first two cops to arrive on scene
Their weapons missing
(nodding) Sid 6
7 is now armed
Where's my gun
Cox glances to Madison, then hands Parker a
45
Be careful with it
: passing through the Security Checkpoints outside the Prison
Parker at the wheel
Madison beside him
It's afternoon
Parker presents his identification to a , then drives through the final checkpoint
Madison reviews Lindenmeyer's file
(without looking up) You remember how to get to Toluca Lake
He glances at her, then stops the car
Parker gets out of the car
Madison follows suit
What are you doing
He walks around the car, brushing past her
Then drops to his knees at the side of the road
He puts his hands in the dirt, feeling the earth between his fingers
(meaningfully) Every day for the last five years, told myself someday  would be out here again
No more bars
No more guards
No more fights just to stay alive
(a beat) Every day for the last five years, told myself that lie
It wasn't a lie
Every time  said it, it was never really thought  was going to make it
Taking a deep breath, he wipes the dirt off his hands
Then stands
You all right
(completely at ease) Fine
Never felt better in my life
(a beat) See, 'm a good liar
He gets back in the vehicle
Off Madison's reaction, we : talking live to their cameras on the street in front of a beautiful, suburban home in Toluca Lake, which is now a crime scene
6
(to her camera) ) As
Officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes
Parker and Madison make their way through the curious trying to see what's going on
Several  double-take Parker, then quickly instruct their  to take shots of him
Parker and Madison present their identification to the keeping the curious at bay
#1 (recognizing Parker) Son
of
a
bitch
Parker and Madison continue toward the house
Getting an increasing amount of attention, particularly from the other Some look on with awe
Some with disdain
But nobody is in between
(quietly to Parker) You ready for this
Don't worry
If  can't handle it, 'll just kill everybody
He gives her a brief smile
Which Madison does not return
One of the other policemen tentatively approaches Parker
#2 've always wanted to tell you that if the same thing happened to me, would do the exact same thing as you --	if  had the balls
He extends his hand to Parker, who shakes it
#3 (to Cop #2) Then you'd be a disgrace to the badge, too
He turns to Parker, who is looking right at him
Not with anger
Not with any emotion, really
But it's enough to scare the shit out of Cop #3, who walks away
Investigators analyze the crime scene extensively with every device imaginable
Parker and Madison survey the scene with nothing but their eyes
Lying in the middle of the living room are the four victims: the affluent couple and the first two cops to arrive
Their bodies were left in similar condition to Reilly's
Except their heads have been interchanged
Parker and Madison turn their attention to a message written in blood on a wall
It reads:
(knowledgeably) He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done
Charlie
You say that like you're close, personal friends
've spent over 50 hours interviewing him
(a beat) Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate
After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done
(a beat) The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6
7
know who would know
: ' in Culver City
Magic hour
Parker pulls the squad car into a space across the street
Hitting the vehicle parked in front of them
In which two   sit waiting to see if Lindenmeyer returns
Parker waves apologetically
(sarcastically) You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years
He ignores her as they get out of the car
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight
Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17
All he did day and night was play the violin
What happened when he was 17
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers
(a beat) Stay here
She approaches the cops, who remain in their car
(') Any sign of Lindenmeyer
None, yet
Mind if we take a look inside
Not until somebody gets a search warrant signed
It's Sunday don't think they've even found a judge, yet
They all turn their heads to see Parker has kicked in Lindenmeyer's front door and is going inside
(' ) (shaking his head) 'm gonna have to call this in
Do what you've got to do
(running after Parker) So will
' Madison races through the broken front door to find Parker checking his weapon
Before she can speak, he motions for Madison to freeze and be silent
Parker hears Something
Something moving inside the duplex
His every movement is now that of a predator
Madison awkwardly removes her own weapon from her purse
She does not handle it with confidence
Parker shakes his head
(quietly) You've got a problem with me carrying a gun
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure 'm nowhere near it
Parker bolts through the duplex, storming into rooms furiously
His movements are aggressive
Madison searches other rooms methodically
She is not timid
Just inexperienced in the field
She passes a video camera mounted on a tripod
Pointed out the window at a neighbor's bathroom
Dozens of cassettes surround the tripod
The labels are dated  covering every day of the last month
Parker and Madison enter opposite sides of the kitchen with their guns drawn, nearly shooting each other
Madison puts down her gun
Parker does not
The noise persists
(looking through his sight) Bang
He smiles wickedly, and continues on
Madison takes a deep breath, then resumes her search
Parker and Madison end up ' It's as if the Information Superhighway ended in here
Cluttered stockpiles of hardware and software: computers, books, folders, disks, and tapes
What you notice, however, is that    relates to of : serial killers, mass murderers, terrorists, kidnappers, rapists, bombers, extortionists, anarchists, you name it, it's here
The psychology of, the methodology of, the history of, the encyclopedia of, the autobiographies of human villainy
and lifelike   can be heard coming from a computer
This is what Parker has been hearing
He holsters his sidearm
So does Madison
Who checks her pulse
What are you doing
(clinically) Checking my pulse
It's elevated
(a beat) You enjoy frightening me, don't you
You've studied me, now 'm studying you
Seems only fair, don't you think
An animated man, who resembles Lindenmeyer, walks peacefully through a park
He then starts killing everything in sight
Men, women, squirrels, even flowers
All to classical music
The scene immediately starts over, with the man once again walking peacefully through the park
This was Lindenmeyer's ' Looking around the room, Madison shakes her head
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work
(looking at a book shelf) Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him
He runs his finger along a book shelf, pausing at two books in particular
Their titles are: , and   -- They were written by Dr
Madison Carter
(') 'm surprised you didn't write one about me
'm still working on it
Noticing something on the floor, she picks up a bizarre looking synthesizer keyboard off the floor
You read its name:
(') Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains
've been in prison, remember
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one
Madison elects not to respond
She sits down at the computer, which rests between busts of Beethoven and Mozart, and begins typing at the computer
She works with efficiency
Knowing exactly what she's doing
She is now in her element
From a shelf, Parker picks up a moldy piece of licorice inserted into a half-eaten pudding cup
Then flips through one of the books written by Madison
Only half-interested
(keeping her eyes on screen) am the demon from the bottomless pit
(remembering, not reading) here on earth to create havoc and terror
am War,  am death am destruction

Who said that

(a beat) What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6
7
(pointing to the screen) He's part of the mix
Sid 6
7 is a composite
The graphics show you that Sid 1
2 was a combination of Charles Manson and Billy the Kid
You see what look like two viruses, which represent each criminal's psychological profile, attacking each other
The result is a molten blob
Berkowitz was added to create Sid 1
3
three-way psychological battle, more hostile than the first, occurs
Sid 1
4, adding the terrorist, Abu Nidal, makes the conflict even more violent
And so on
' Madison stares at the computer screen in awe
Parker flips through - hard copies of the different versions of Sid
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain
(understanding) Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts
But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones
She continues opening the files of the higher versions of Sid
Version 5
9 consists of 67 different profiles
The visualized psychological battle is intense
And extremely violent
The 6
7 version, with 183 profiles, is even worse
(') It's a good bet a couple of the dominant personalities teamed up to overpower the others
(a beat) The question is, which one of the dominants then finally managed to take control
Attempting to open the files of the composite profiles, Madison discovers they are protected by encryption
(') (re: Lindenmeyer) ) He'll let us see the ingredients that went in, but not how the soup turned out after stirring
Madison scrolls through the list of 183 names, stopping at the name
Alarm registers on her face
As Parker comes over to look over her shoulder, she quickly scrolls through the list to get the name off the screen
He holds the Sid 6
7 - in hand
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it
This is like the World Series to you
As a matter of fact, it is
Parker points to a name on the screen:
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week
Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory
(re: Sid 6
7 -) We need to get a look at Sid 6
7's final profile
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick
: 6
7 - being inserted into a disc drive inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab
Very high-tech
Sitting at the computer is , 60s, the "grand old wizard" of the facility
Parker and Madison sit next to him
Around them, young Lindenmeyers are everywhere
(remembering fondly) ) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most
But he was singularly the most brilliant student  ever had in a classroom
He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies
Can you tell us what's on the disc
(working the computer) ) There is one program with approximately 1
3 million lines of programming
It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it
Think you can get into the program
(with appreciation) ) Hard to say  Lindenmeyer's protection mechanisms were always diabolically clever
You should see what he's been up to recently
: kissing passionately inside a car parked along a deserted street in Hollywood
Music blares from inside the vehicle
Steam on the windows partially obscures your view
As well as Sid 6

The Manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family

He raises the gun, placing it against the steamed window
But does  pull the trigger
His face going through a rapid change of expression  as if a battle for control of his emotions were going on
Regaining control, Sid 6

Madison pockets the car keys, then reveals a pair of handcuffs
She latches one cuff to the steering wheel, and holds up the other toward Parker
Give me your wrist
Give me a goddam break

Even disbelief
He had no idea Madison was a mother
Moments later, Karin comes back out and sits on the front steps
Staring at Parker
With fascination
Curiosity
Wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a police car outside her house
But not saying a word
Parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation with her
multitude of expressions passing over his face as memories of his own daughter flash through his mind
: ' Madison sits at a desk, typing quickly at a computer
Via modem, she connects with the
Criminal Library
She rifles through data concerning  , who was the leader of a cult of cyber anarchists
He was known as the Charles Manson of technological terrorism
From both newspaper  and news , the following information about him becomes clear: Grimes was an expert at media manipulation
He delighted in publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way
The Mayor of Los Angeles, Bob Bennett, who offered increasingly higher rewards for Grimes' capture, was Grimes' primary nemesis
Special Investigations Division Officer Parker Barnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett
Grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false leads and lawsuits
You see footage of a woman lying dead in an alley
note is pinned to her clothing
The note reads: ", , '
" Grimes then kidnapped Parker's wife and daughter
Parker located the group in a club, but only in time to witness their deaths
Parker then killed everybody in the club, including the six cult members and two completely innocent people
Madison stares gravely into the screen
Grimes, you better not be the dominant
: ' Parker and Karin continue staring at each other in silence
He smiles
Then she smiles
She wiggles her nose
Then so does he
Madison comes out wearing fresh clothing, then kisses her daughter good night
As Madison goes to the squad car, Karin waves good-bye to Parker
He does the same
Karin's babysitter then leads her back inside the house
' Madison gets in, immediately noticing the handcuffs dangling from the steering wheel
Parker has been free the entire time
Told you  wasn't going to go anywhere
How did you get your hand out
As she unlocks the handcuffs from the steering wheel, Parker wiggles his mechanical hand in front of her face
Sometimes,  like being part machine
Annoyed, Madison tosses him the car keys
He starts the engine and drives

What does that mean
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality
Sid is going to evolve
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next
What  do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6
7 is going to be even worse than he was before
Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert
He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does

All are frozen in their seats with fear
Sid 6
7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a baton

It isn't easy for her

Description of the perp matches the surveillance photographs from taken this morning
That's only a couple blocks from here

Tossing his coffee out the window, he opens the door
(deadly serious) Don't get out of the car
Stop me
He gets out, running down the sidewalk
He flies past the cars inching down the block

She climbs into the driver's seat, spilling hot coffee on herself
Parker bolts recklessly through the downtown street
hunter hot on the trail of his prey in an urban jungle

7 gently caresses the hair of a terrified young sitting among several others
You hear the sound of tires to a halt outside

Her expression changes instantly
Dramatically

Sid 6
7 spins around and fires twice before he can finish his sentence
Both Cops receive  wounds in their shooting arms, reminding you of the wounds Parker and John first received in the opening virtual reality sequence
Sid 6
7 takes a bow, as if on stage
6
7 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you've been a real pleasure
As he walks toward the exit, he admires himself in the mirror behind the bar
Sid 6
7 has never seen his own image in the real world before
He likes what he sees
Street traffic is much lighter here
Sid 6
7 exits, getting into the vacant police car left by the cops

7 adjusts his seat
The rearview mirror
Glancing at himself
Then behind him

Running like a dog who's got the scent

7 looks pleased

7 Well, look who it
bullet spiderwebs the rear window
Sid 6

Parker races after Sid 6
7, firing his weapon continuously
for the innocent  nearby
They in absolute terror, but remain unharmed
Physically, anyway
Parker gives up the chase of Sid 6
7's vehicle and runs in the other direction
Toward Madison as she rounds the corner in their squad car
' He opens the driver's side door and shoves Madison over
What the hell's going on
This is my area of expertise
He jumps behind the wheel, flooring the accelerator
Speeding through the already frightened motorists
Madison is pinned to the back of her seat
Looking out the window, she looks at the motorists
(with concern) What did you do to those people
Nothing
Parker's vehicle speeds through city streets
Gaining ground on Sid 6
7
Parker stops for nothing
Not for red lights
Not for gridlock
When the street becomes impassable, he veers onto the sidewalk
' Parker's eyes are locked to the road with fierce determination
Madison's eyes are a mixture of fear and excitement
She holds onto the door handle for dear life
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it

You know  am

Parker glances at his mechanical hands gripping the wheel
Madison can't believe he is able to carry on a conversation while driving like this

Madison clicks off the radio
You have nothing in common
She puts her hand to her wrist -- checking her pulse
(shaking his head) Enough with your pulse already

Madison takes out her weapon
Her hands are shaking

You better be a cop, pal

Left pocket
Show me
Sid 6
7 slowly reaches inside his jacket and fires his weapon through it
He only gets a hole in his jacket
The Traffic Cop gets a hole through his chest

7 God, some people are stupid
He aims his weapon at Parker's oncoming vehicle
' Madison leans out the window, aiming her gun at Sid 6
7, as Parker speeds toward the gridlock
Nail the fucker
Madison's determination battles her inexperience
Sid 6
7 gets off the first shot
That was the windshield by Parker's head
He ducks down, driving blind
(') Any time now
Madison fires
Nowhere close
She adjusts her sights and fires again
The result is the same
What's the problem
'm doing the best  can
That was Sid 6
7 shooting their front left tire
Parker loses control of the vehicle
Parker's vehicle  into a car stopped in front of them
Air bags save Parker and Madison from injury, but also prevent them from getting out of the car with any speed
By the time they do get out, Sid 6
7 is long gone
Parker stares at Madison with pure hatred
: in the
Downtown Headquarters the next morning
Chief Cox stares angrily at Parker
Madison sits next to him
Behind them is a mirrored wall
(reading from a list) illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex
Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed
Twentyfour citizen complaints
And the calls are just starting to come in
(to Parker) forgot what it's like to have you on the streets
Any sign of Lindenmeyer
None
He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach
(a beat) Any idea what Sid's going to do next
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure
In other words, we collectively don't know shit
Wallace and Deane look on through the twoway mirror
Deane is on the phone
(re: Parker) It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform
(a beat) will never forget the first time saw the photos from the crime scene

Unless Mr
Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, 'm going to put him back in his cage

Police now believe there to be a connection between the grisly Toluca Lake murders yesterday afternoon, and the hostage situation which occurred last night in a downtown bar
The  is one of many mounted above the checkout counters
waiting in line with their shopping carts watch the news with varying degrees of horror, disgust, curiosity, and fear
The stronger their reaction, the more Sid 6

They're chemicallyrisen

Off the cashier's look, we : watching the news on a pocket  on a wooden bench that morning
Both proud and horrified at the monster he has unleashed upon the world
You hear   in the background
Lindenmeyer begins to laugh
Uncontrollably
The sounds echoing
As   , you realize the bench is one of many inside the Hollywood Bowl
Lindenmeyer is the only person sitting in the stands
He glances down at the members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic as they rehearse for an upcoming performance
Whatever the event is, it's going to be big
Dozens of technicians surround the stage, setting lights, cameras, microphones, etc
for a live, payperview broadcast
: talking on a phone inside the Cal Tech Computer Lab
'm afraid  don't have very good news
: on the speakerphone inside Cox's Office
Were you able to get into the program
Yes
But then  tripped over an erasure mine
In English, please
accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program
Parker and Madison turn to each other - shit

We appreciate you trying
Look,  feel bad about this, so 'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you

Noon
Something in a store front catches his attention
Namely, his own image being captured by a video camera pointed at the sidewalk
He is standing outside a large electronics store
Sid 6
7 walks closer to the window, moving into a
He is captivated by his image
Fascinated
And intrigued
This is the first time he has ever seen himself on screen
Dozens of TVs on display
There is a different channel on each
The audio/visual bombardment is overwhelming
Sid 6
7 enters, making his way to a big screen  with the local news in progress
(from the )
commuters travelling anywhere near the Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow evening should allow themselves at least 30 extra minutes to get home
Security for the Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally is going to be so tight that all bus and subway routes passing through the area are being rerouted
Sid 6
7 changes the channel to a different news broadcast
Parker's Folsom County Prison

The news broadcast zooms in on Parker's picture
Sid 6
7 wiggles his synthetic fingers in front of his face

7 (') We really do have so much in common
But  refuse to be upstaged
He changes the channel back to the first news broadcast reporter stands amid the chaos outside the bar where Sid 6
7 had terrified the patrons
Sid 6
7 turns to the other  in the store
Most of them are watching other channels
He goes over to a control pad on a counter and presses several buttons
Now   in the store has the news with the reporter outside the bar on
, sporting numerous Nazi swastika tattoos, manually changes the channel on one of the TVs to a Dodger baseball game
Sid 6
7 walks over to the Skinhead and changes the channel back to the news
You don't wanna fuck with me, man
He moves to the next  over and changes the channel to the baseball game
Sid 6
7 moves over with him, standing directly behind the Skinhead as if also interested in the Dodgers

Take me out for the fun
He places his hands on the Skinhead's head and efficiently snaps his head around, breaking his neck

He drops the Skinhead to the floor, never once taking his eyes off the

The fans also respond to seeing themselves on the massive screen

7 from behind a customer
'  -- As Sid 6
7 realizes he's being videotaped, his entire face seems to light up
Playing directly to the camera, he clearly loves being in the spotlight
The attention
The focus
It's suddenly as if he's had years of training
He is completely at ease
And simply captivating

7 (direct address) 'm sorry  can't do more for you

7) You've discovered media, haven't you
You like the attention

You like being a star
What are you going to do next, star
What are you going to
Her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen, where onlookers are visible watching Sid 6
7
Their faces blurry
But even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize Lindenmeyer
(') (as if to Lindenmeyer) You do like to watch, don't you
(to the surrounding cops) If any of you are looking for Daryl Lindenmeyer, that's him
She points to Lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to Parker, who's standing exactly where Sid 6
7 was when he killed the Skinhead
Parker does not look at Madison
His eyes are fixed on the  in front of him

7's performances that are increasing
Stars need bigger and bigger audiences

DeMille
Even the players are starting to get distracted
The players on the field are all looking up at the massive screen
The Woman's face appears on various monitors
The phone No one answers it
The room appears to be empty
The stadium's closed-circuit  director is not in his chair
He's lying dead on the floor
The closedcircuit camera remains focused on the Woman
The camera is locked off
It's operator lies dead beside it

His words  around the stadium as he  the Woman's neck
He then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him

7 (') That's all, folks
He leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area
climbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel
Weapon in hand
He draws a bead on Sid 6
7's back
bullet rips through Sid 6
7's side
Blood begins to seep from the wound
But then immediately begins to retract
Once his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound
Leaving a scar
Which also then disappears
Other than the hole in his shirt, Sid 6
7 is as good as new
He never even misses a step as he disappears around the corner
stares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades

People bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the stadium as
squad cars approach in the distance
The car in the lead is Parker's
' Parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto the street
Madison braces herself
Parker  on the brakes with both feet
Parker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who keep right on running
Parker jumps out of the vehicle, scanning faces
In predator mode
Madison gets out, clearly shaken
Parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance
guy in Dodger baseball cap and jacket
Walking calmly away from the stadium
He descends down an escalator into a recently-built subway station
It is Sid 6
7
charges after him
heatseeking missile locked on target
Parker
Parker
She does the best she can to follow after him
People knock into Parker as hard as he does them
human version of bumper cars
Reaching the entrance to the subway, Parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time
Madison remains in his wake
Parker and Madison hop the turnstiles
Only to be stopped by a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry, which is identical to one you have seen before
This sentry was one of Reilly's creations at
(male, authoritarian) Stop
You are in violation of
Parker spits in the Robot's electronic eye
Temporarily blinding it, as well as the guy operating it via remote control
Parker and Madison make their getaway as the robotic sentry struggles to clean off his eye
Real effective security
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know
Authority still makes me nervous
They come to a fork: one tunnel goes to east/west trains, the other to north/south
Which way
Both
He races down the tunnel to the north/south trains
Madison heads down the other
Her determination beginning to win out over her inexperience
hesitates at the escalator leading to the south-bound side of the tracks
Further down the tunnel is the escalator to the northbound trains
Parker chooses the escalator closest to him
- Passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted above them
Except for Parker, who scans the crowd
Then across the tracks
- In the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching the  screen
He is watching Parker
Through his gun sight
Sid 6
7 pulls the trigger
- Parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet
He scrambles behind a pillar for protection
Only to see the guy standing behind him wasn't as lucky
- Madison hears the gunshot  through the station
Which scares the already-terrified fans trying to get away from Dodger Stadium
Chaos is rapidly becoming Pandemonium
She races up the escalator, taking out her weapon
: peeking out from behind the pillar on the south-bound platform
'  -- Passengers rush in every direction
Some are screaming
Some are crying
Nobody knows who fired the shot
Or where to go
But everyone is going somewhere
Including Sid 6
7, who makes his way through the flurry of movement toward the up escalator
It is difficult to keep sight of him
moves toward the edge of the platform, aiming his gun across the tracks
Those around him quickly back away
(yelling) Everybody get down
Only about half the passengers on the northbound side can hear him above the screaming already going on
Sid 6
7 is nowhere to be seen
(') (screaming) The rest of the passengers hit the deck, except for a listening to music on headphones
He is riding the escalator up
Sid 6
7 stands behind him, using the student as a shield
' As Sid 6
7 ascends, slight portions of his body are momentarily exposed behind the student as he sways with the music coming from his headphones
Parker does  have a clean shot
In 10 seconds, Sid 6
7 will disappear from view completely and Parker will have no shot at all
momentary sliver of Sid 6
7 becomes visible
An inch-and-a-half at most
doesn't hesitate
He lines up his shot and pulls the trigger
- The college student standing in front of Sid 6
7 gets winged in the shoulder
Not a serious wound, but a painful one just the same
The bullet must have hit bone, because it deflected upon impact, missing Sid 6
7 entirely
The student drops to the escalator, screaming in pain
Sid 6
7 crouches beside him
6
7 (yelling) What's wrong, convict, your arms need adjusting
Or maybe it's your head
Maybe you aren't ready to be back out in the real world, yet
' The top of Sid 6
7's head is exposed an inch, maybe two
fires again
Repeatedly
Moving closer and closer to the edge of the platform, trying to get a better angle while he still has a shot
Parker moves to the very edge of the platform
His arm extended out over it
Completely oblivious to rocketing into the station toward the south-bound platform
leaps off the descending escalator on the southbound side and rushes to Parker
She pulls Parker back just before the train reaches him
Had his arm still been raised, Parker would have lost his arm a second time
They tumble to the floor
rushes to Madison
#1 (pointing to Parker) Lady, you gotta stop him
He's gone crazy
#2 He just shot an innocent bystander
(forcefully to Parker) What were you shooting at
Parker gets to his feet
Madison doesn't take her eyes off him
#1 He did   saw it
#2 (to Madison) Sid's getting away
He heads toward the up escalator
His back now to Madison
She aims her gun at him
Parker - stop
Don't make me shoot you (not looking back) If you're gonna do it, better do it now
He keeps right on going up the escalator
lines up her shot
Hands shaking
With both fear and determination
Her finger presses down on the trigger
but she can't do it
Dammit
She chases after him
/ Madison looks in both directions as she gets off the escalator
Parker is nowhere to be seen
Moving toward her slowly is the wounded college student, who clutches his bleeding shoulder
He is shivering
Going into shock
Madison goes to him, taking off his headphones
Let me help you
He collapses in her arms
(delirious) What did  do
didn't do anything
Clearly versed in emergency medical treatment, Madison attends to his wound
Parker returns
(breathlessly) lost him
(furiously) Call 9-1-1
Wait for me above ground
: 30 minutes later
The chaos outside Dodger Stadium has subsided
Madison and two  lead the bandaged College Student to an ambulance
Madison goes to Parker, who sits quietly by himself
Elbows on his knees
Head between his hands
Staring at the cement between his feet
(angrily) Do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through
Parker doesn't respond
All around them, a cacophony of news broadcasts is heard
From passing cars
From boom boxes
From portable TVs
Over and over, you hear what Sid 6
7 had said while killing the woman in Dodger Stadium: 6
7 (
0
) (recorded) Hey, Parker, this one's for you
Hey, Parker, this one's for you
As Parker raises his head slowly, you realize you are looking at the face of a wild animal
Eyes rabid
Jaw clenched
Pure anger
Violence about to erupt
Without fear
Without guilt
The beast within has been unleashed
(in a whisper) That's Grimes
Madison backs away in fear
Parker rises gradually
(') (voice slowly rising) The man who killed my wife
who killed my daughter
who ruined my life used to taunt me with that line
Parker advances toward Madison, who continues backing away
(') (exploding) Grimes is back
He's back
He's come back
(standing her ground) No
Grimes isn't back
He's only one part of Sid
Sid 6
7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was
(a beat) Get a hold of yourself
She tries to grab him by the shoulders
Parker blocks her arms away
(going nosetonose) But he's in there
And you knew it, didn't you
Didn't you
She tries to back away, but backs herself against a light pole
Madison has nowhere to go
Parker grabs her by the collar, and shoves her against the pole
Hard
(') (hysterical) God, you fucking know-it-all
You've known all along and didn't (') tell me
Why
Were you afraid 'd lose it
Go over the edge
Huh
Is that what you were afraid of
'
prison transport and another police vehicle pull up to them fast
Two of the Prison Guards met earlier jump out of the transport, advancing on Parker
Their weapons aimed at his head
Hands up
Now
Parker slowly raises his hands in the air
Guard relieves him of his weapon
(recovering) What's going on
He's going back where he belongs
Deane and Cox step out of the police vehicle
(to Madison) You were right, Dr
Carter
Letting a lunatic like Barnes loose in the real world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public
(glancing at Cox) should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another
(to Madison) Chief Cox will give you a ride back to the station
You will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far
(to Parker) Enjoy the rest of your sentence, Mr
Barnes
She exits
Cox and Parker stand facing each other
Cox wishes there was something he could do
Parker looks completely out of it
Cox extends his hand
After a moment, Parker takes it
But his mind is way off elsewhere
(forcefully to Parker) Let's go
Madison looks on as Parker is herded roughly into the back of the prison transport
Parker
Parker shuts her up with a look
There is nothing that can be said
The prison transport doors are  shut
The vehicle takes off
: ' Cox and Madison head back toward
Headquarters
They are in midconversation: (with regret) should have told him
Don't blame yourself
In your shoes,  don't think  would have told Parker, either
(a beat) So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality
'm not sure
My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think
(a beat) You think he's smart
Captain, 'm afraid of how smart Sid 6
7 is
(a beat) But 'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming
: comes to a stop at a traffic light
-- Parker sits alone in the darkness
Motionless
Until the sound of   piercing the transport's front windshield  the silence
What the hell's going on
He scrambles to the front of the compartment, pressing his face against the steel mesh of the fourinch portal
-- Two bullet holes are visible in the windshield
The two Prison Guards lie dead in their seats
Sid 6
7's eyes appear, looking directly at you
He's smiling

7 (neighborly) Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again
Parker goes absolutely berserk
Viciously punching the steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his knuckles is shredded
You
mother
fucker
' 6
7 Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy
mean, just because 'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends

He savagely hurls himself against his confines
Bone vs
metal
Don't try this at home

Is there anyone else you would like to talk to

7 (a beat) You really are pathetic, you know that
Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet
He is nothing compared to me
Parker is completely spent
Mentally and physically
He slumps in a corner
Out of breath
Bleeding
Sore
All he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at Sid 6

After transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds

Now who would you rather go after, killer, them or me
He releases the rear door lock
Parker bursts out of the back of the Prison Transport, charging after Sid 6
7
Who is nowhere to be seen
Parker runs in one direction
Then the other
And changes his mind again
He literally does not know which way to turn
Shit
: An  rushes through the door to Cox, who's briefing Deane and Wallace on what he has learned
Parker Barnes just escaped from the prison transport
Both of the guards are dead
The Aide exits
(to Deane) Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards
Do  need to remind you what happened to his wife
To his daughter
(with conviction) will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards
You already have staked your reputation

Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6
7 might go after him, too
(a beat) Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose
(to Wallace) The fail-safe online, yet
Online and at your disposal
(to Deane) What failsafe
(approaching Wallace) This had better work, Mr
Wallace
Wallace exits the room
Cox has no idea what is going on
And Deane is not about to tell him
: ' Madison enters wearily, late afternoon
Exhausted from the events of the last two days, she starts to undress
Her clothing is filthy
So is her skin
She could use a good shower, and a better massage
Madison examines the various cuts and bruises she's received along the way
Not exactly war wounds, but to somebody used to sitting behind a desk, they are
She absentmindedly turns on the television, then goes into her bathroom
Madison looks at her face in the mirror
She's looked better
After splashing cold water on her face, she comes to the same conclusion
Madison takes two aspirin
And then two more
Wishing they would take effect immediately
Finally hearing the news on the , her entire demeanor changes instantly
Madison rushes in front of the television to see a report of Parker's escape from the prison transport
Oh, shit
Grabbing a handful of clothes, she bolts urgently out the door
: speeding recklessly through city streets in her car
She doesn't stop for red lights
Not for grid-lock
Not for nothing
She is also still finishing getting dressed
: Ignoring the warnings of several  walking toward their vehicles, Madison speeds toward the front entrance
She barely stops in time
Madison races through the bustling facility
Looking for somebody
She finally finds Cox coming out of his office
(urgently) There is no way Parker killed those guards
No way
think we both know who did
(a beat) What's so urgent
need your help-- Taking him by the arm, she leads him into an elevator going down just before its doors close
The look on Cox's face tells you Madison has explained the situation to him
He is furious
Why didn't anybody tell me
don't set policy
(a beat) You have the key
He takes a security key out of his pocket and uses it to gain access to a subterranean floor
(angrily) This is a police department
'll be damned if this is going to go on without my knowledge
They exit quickly
Cox leads Madison Cox leads in Madison and takes her to the subterranean power supply
He points to the floor's numerous circuit breakers
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach
Got it
The room is still under construction
Wallace stands behind a sitting at a console in front of a massive electronic map tracking several convicts, including Parker
The technician is typing in an elaborate termination code
Who are we going to fry
Just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor
Cox enters, concerning Wallace
(') What are you doing here, sir
Just paying my last respects
He surveys the electronic map, locating Parker
Just as the lights go
Wallace and the technician immediately panic
What happened
don't know
We've lost all power
The heat's been causing brown out's all over the city
Get above ground until it's restored
Wallace and the technician rush out of the room, up the emergency stairs
Cox sets to work ripping out the console's circuitry
By the time he's finished, the equipment in here won't be able to toast a piece of bread
: which reads:    (19611992) and (1987-1992)
Parker kneels in front of it
Magic hour
Madison, and Cox wind their way to him through obstacle course of tombstones
Parker stands as they arrive
He is wiped out
There is no emotion left in him
We know you didn't kill those guards
They're going to fry me for it, anyway
Nobody's going to fry anybody
He approaches, holding the Circuits he ripped out of the Locator Transmission Room
(re: circuits) Don't worry, they have no idea where you are
You sonofabitch
How could you let them put the implant in my head
How
He didn't know about the neural toxin
(a beat) did
(matter-of-factly) You knew the entire time
Can you give me one good reason why  shouldn't kill you right now
She saved your life, Parker
She didn't have to, but she did
(turning to Madison) Then  guess we're even
(a beat) How did you find out about the toxin
Sid 6
7 told me after he killed the two guards
He suggested  kill you rather than him
You're not capable of it
pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember
was wrong
(a beat) And  was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid
should have told you
won't make the same mistake again
She means it
Parker turns away, looking at his wife's headstone
The sonofa-bitch is still out there, Parker
Parker turns toward him slowly
Emotion beginning to return to his face
(a beat) When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head
On my life,  promise you  will
If you're lying, 'll hunt you down and kill you myself
: 6
The human  presses a remote control detonator
An explosion occurs inside a building's foundation ( )
The building is levelled instantly
Sid 6
7, who's been watching the explosion, approaches the Foreman
6
7 (applauding) Bravo
Who the hell are you
6
7 Someone who appreciates the artistic value of highexplosives
He shoots the Foreman in the chest
Sid 6
7 relieves him of his keys and heads to an explosives storage shed
: 6
7 carrying a crate of -4 high-explosives out of the shed in the construction sight minutes later
He adds it to the dozen crates already loaded in a truck
And takes off
: Sid 6
7 secures several crates of C4 to an automated sewer cleaning vehicle
He schedules its start time  24 hours from now
It is now 7:45
The bomb's  is set to detonate 15 minutes into the vehicle's journey -- at 8:00 tomorrow night
6
7 (admiring his work) You think you know me, but you don't have any idea who  really am
: sight of Mayor Bennett's upcoming Re-Election Rally, Cox supervises an army of
officers who are securing the area
Bombsniffing dogs
Rooftop snipers
Helicopter surveillance
Nothing is being left to chance
Anyone doing anything within 100 yards of the building is searched, including the  and their covering the convention's security
survey the scene with binoculars from amid a crowd of pedestrians two blocks away
Both are disguised in hats and different clothing
You don't immediately recognize them
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think
told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious
Sid 6
7 isn't Grimes
Part of him is
Various faces in the crowd on the sidewalk
In the vehicles passing on the street
On the bridge crossing the street down the block further away from the hotel
(
0
) If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind
(
0
) Think he's keeping track of his creation
(
0
) That, or living through him
puts down his binoculars
Madison does not
See something
'm not sure
on the bridge
the guy at the payphone
She points to what she's looking at
Looking through his binoculars, he still can't see what she means
She helps him aim his binoculars
'  -- He scans the bridge
Finally settling on Sid 6
7, who is talking on a payphone
Parker looks up from his binoculars
Impressed
Nice work
(a beat) Thanks
They move briskly down the block toward the bridge
Quickly climbing a set of stairs
Parker and Madison's movement catches the attention of several snipers
#1 Well, look who we have here
#2 (into radio) Parker Barnes is heading south toward the bridge
If anybody can get a clean shot at him, take it
hears the order over his radio headset
He races toward the bridge
As do a dozen other cops
Sid 6
7 talks into the payphone
6
7 Be a reporter  figure it out for yourself
All 'm going to tell you is that at 8:00 tomorrow night, will become legendary
reach the top of the stairs
Sid 6
7 remains on the phone, his back toward Parker and Madison
They split-up, winding their way through the crowd waiting for an arriving bus
As the bus pulls to the stop, the awaiting passengers move toward the opening doors
Obscuring Parker's view of the payphone
Parker shoves his way through the crowd, only to see Sid 6
7 holding Madison in front of him, his gun to her head
Parker trains his weapon at Sid 6
7
He doesn't have a clean shot
6
7 (to Parker) Brings back memories, doesn't it
' Parker's chest is put into the cross-hairs as the bus pulls away from the stop
He is focused on Parker, and Parker only
is some 300 yards away on a rooftop
His rifle is mounted on a tripod
His aim is perfectly steady
(into his radio headset) Say goodbye, Parker Barnes
Parker stands frozen, staring at Sid 6
7 through his gun sight
Looking for just an inch of him to stick out from behind Madison's terrified face
6
7 (to Parker) wouldn't pull the trigger if were you Why's that
Cox advances toward Sid 6
7 from the side of the bridge
Cox's gun out and ready
His finger on the trigger
Hey, Sid, what were you planning on doing with the -4
Sid 6
7 turns his head in surprise toward Cox as a rifle is in the distance
Cox steps directly in the sniper's line-of-fire and takes the bullet meant for Parker through the chest
Cox drops to the bridge
He rushes to Cox
Parker drops to his knees, cradling Cox's head
Cox isn't long for this earth
Looking up to Parker, he tries to talk
But nothing comes out
(') (compassionately) Don't worry,  know
know
Cox's eyes roll back in his head
Parker then closes them and gently lays his head on the sidewalk
Parker turns his head toward Sid 6
7, who's released Madison and is jumping over a railing to the street 20 feet below
Parker rushes to the railing
Sid 6
7 lands on top of a garbage truck passing beneath the bridge
The garbage truck disappears beneath the bridge
dozen cops advance toward Parker
Weapons drawn
#4 Freeze
Parker ignores them
He bolts across the street, moving in the same direction as the bus below
Through speeding traffic
Bullets fly
Parker keeps charging
Right in front of a moving van barreling across the bridge
The cops lose sight of Parker
#5 Think he made it
Parker dives onto the sidewalk, avoiding the speeding van by inches
Getting to his feet, he launches himself up and over the railing
The garbage truck passes beneath Parker as he leaps from the bridge
Parker lands on the back of the truck
Right next the opening and-closing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash compactor
His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the street
Sid 6
7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his stomach
And his face against the steel teeth
Sid 6
7 chokes Parker
Hard
6
7 have to tell you,  do enjoy you, Parker
really don't want to have to kill you
The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck
: who had been on the bridge, charging down the steps after the garbage truck, which can no longer be seen
Madison walks calmly behind them
Scanning the crowd
Looking for Lindenmeyer
Her every instinct telling her he's here
He must be
She spots him
Veering from the direction the cops headed in, Madison casually wades into the crowd
She takes out her weapon and stops behind Lindenmeyer
Even in disguise, he looks familiar
Madison puts her gun against his back
(whispering into his ear) figured you'd show up sooner or later
: Parker and Sid 6
7 continue battling next to the compactor's lethal jaws
The machine makes an awful, grinding sound
Not unlike the sounds Parker and Sid 6
7 are making
The fight is primal
Savage
And moving at 30 miles-per-hour
What -4
was Cox talking about
6
7 Let me put it to you this way
whether 'm here
or whether 'm not
'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night
Where did you plant the -4
He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking questions, because he's losing
Parker takes a wicked shot to the face, and then the groin
Sid 6
7 holds Parker's head between the compactor's jaws
Which are closing
With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs up into Sid 6
7
Which throws Sid 6
7 into the compactor
The steel jaws immediately close in on Sid 6
7, who frantically tries to climb out
He gets his hands out
Then his head
But that's about it
Without emphasizing graphic detail, Sid 6
7 is decapitated
His lifeless body drops back into the compactor
His head tumbles to the street
The force of the impact causes the Sid 6
7 character module to separate from the neural net
The character module scatters into the street
Parker immediately jumps off the truck after it
Parker's landing isn't pretty
Finally getting to his feet, he sees the Sid 6
7 character module is about to be run over
Parker dives for it, nearly getting run over himself
The approaching car  to a halt next to him
It's driven by Lindenmeyer
At gunpoint
Madison sits behind him, her gun to his head
The car behind them obviously wasn't prepared to stop so quickly
The bumpers of the two cars are now intertwined
Neither vehicle will be going anywhere soon
Madison pulls Lindenmeyer roughly out of the car
She drags him to Parker, who is still on his knees, clutching the Sid 6
7 character module
approach in the distance
(to Parker) Find out anything
bomb's going off tomorrow night, but  have no idea where
(a beat) There is only one way to get any more information out of Sid 6
7
They scan the area for a new mode of transport
And find one stopped at a dumpster down the block: the garbage truck
Parker quickly explains the situation to the sanitation worker while Madison motions Lindenmeyer into the cab with her gun
As Parker climbs up to her, Madison shuts the door to give them a moment of privacy
Can  ask you something
(with a smile) You mean there's something you haven't asked me
(a beat) You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon
You stopped Sid 6
7 and you've got his module
You're free to go  right now
(a beat) Why are you going to do this
You don't know
(shaking her head) That's why 'm asking
Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what 'm capable of
And what 'm not
(a beat) And better than anyone else,  am capable of stopping Sid 6
7
: Parker lands on the back of the truck
Right next the openingandclosing steel jaws of the truck's massive trash compactor
His gun tumbles from his hand, falling to the street
This sequence is  to the one you previously witnessed
It is as if we've jumped back in time
Sid 6
7 dives on top of Parker, putting him flat on his stomach
And his face against the steel teeth
Sid 6
7 chokes Parker
Hard
6
7 have to tell you,  do enjoy you, Parker
really don't want to have to kill you
The sanitation worker at the wheel of the truck has no idea whatsoever what is happening on top of his truck
Parker and Sid 6

'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night
Where did you plant the -4
He should concentrate more on fighting, and less on asking questions, because he's losing
Parker takes a wicked shot to the face, and but then blocks the anticipated shot to his gun
Sid 6
7 still manages to put Parker's head between the compactor's jaws
Which are closing
With every last ounce of effort he has, Parker hurls his legs up into Sid 6
7
Which throws Sid 6
7 into the compactor
Sid 6
7 frantically tries to climb out of the compactor as the steel jaws close in on him
He gets his hands out
Then his head
Except Parker now does something different
Just before Sid 6
7 is decapitated, Parker jams a metal rod between the compactor's steel teeth
Then grabs Sid 6
7 by the throat
(fiercely) You can't die until you tell me where the -4 is
Where is it
6
7 (choking) My
secret
He  the back of his head into Parker's nose
Breaking it
Parker reels back in pain
Sid 6
7 squeezes out from within the steel teeth
The jagged metal cutting into him, striping him with blood
The blood then begins to retract
Sid 6
7's wounds, once again, heal themselves
6
7 (') Too bad you can't regenerate
As the truck slows at an intersection, he jumps to the street
Parker goes after him
Still in excruciating pain what you are seeing is The scene continues seamlessly
As you may now be guessing, the monitor is connected to the simulator ' Parker lies unconscious on a bed
He is connected to the simulator via the neural connectors in the polyurethane skull cap, just like he was before
The Sid 6
7 character module is plugged into the system's main console
Lindenmeyer sits at the controls
Madison next to him, her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head
They are both watching Parker chase Sid 6
7 on the monitor in front of them
Parker continues experiencing intolerable pain
clock reads 4:00
They are the only ones inside the entire facility
told you this would work
By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality
He still thinks he's in the real world
(a beat) What's wrong with Parker
(innocently) How should  know
(getting an idea) Show me his physical sensory level
She clicks back the hammer of her gun and presses the barrel against Lindenmeyer's ear
He does as told
On a panel by the console, you read:    : 670%
wonder how that
(') Turn it down
Lindenmeyer adjusts the sensory level back down to 100%
Parker immediately returns back to normal
His pace picks up
He starts closing the gap between him and Sid 6
7 as he races into a shopping mall
: The place is a sevenstory mecca of shopping
An atrium allows you to look from the ground floor up to the seventh
Sid 6
7 rushes up the escalators
Going up to the second floor
Then the third
Parker follows suit climbing escalator after escalator
Throwing people out of his way
which is also the highest, Sid 6
7 veers out of view
Parker races up the final steps to the seventh floor
Sid 6
7 is nowhere to be seen
Parker searches methodically
Efficiently
He finally spots Sid 6
7
Who has Parker's head lined-up perfectly in his gun sight
Parker is a sitting duck
Parker dives behind   2
1, who takes a bullet in his ascot
Parker quickly grabs him, and uses his body as a shield against Sid 6
7's constant gunfire until Parker arrives behind a marble column
6
7 (surprised at Parker's ruthlessness) We really aren't that different, are we
What he cannot see is that behind the column, Affluent Shopper 2
1 is Auto Resetting
Parker puts his gun to the shopper's head
(whispering) Don't move, and don't make a sound
Got it
Affluent Shopper 2
1 nods his head repeatedly
Parker collects himself behind the column, then pivots out from behind it
Firing in Sid 6
7's direction
Each bullet finds its mark
Absorbing the blows, Sid 6
7 backs up against the atrium railing
Taking one final shot, he falls backward
Over the railing
' Sid 6
7 tumbles through the atrium
Out of control
Speeding toward the ground seven floors below
6
7' The sense of momentum is exhilarating
And terrifying
If you get dizzy easily, close your eyes
Sid 6
7 falls through the atrium like a rock directly at you
200 pound rock
He lands face down in the marble floor
The impact is bone crushing
Sid 6
7 does not move
Until he begins to regenerate
His fluids begin returning to his body
His bones regaining proper form
Within seconds, his body appears as good as new
(Technically, because this is VR1 the proper term would be Auto
Reset
But since Sid 6
7 thinks he's in the real world, regenerating is what he thinks he's doing
) Sid 6
7 stands, dusting himself off
6
7 Man, what a rush
(yelling up to Parker) Adios, amigo
Grabbing his gun, he takes off out of the lobby
Parker retrieves his gun, then bolts down the escalators
: Madison and Lindenmeyer watch Parker on screen
Madison still has her gun trained on Lindenmeyer, who notices a start to flash
He turns to Parker's unconscious body lying on the bed
Lindenmeyer looks concerned
What's wrong
Lindenmeyer checks several readings on his console
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance
Talk so  can understand
If  don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when  take him out of Then fix it
As Lindenmeyer moves to Parker, Madison stays right with him
Her gun aimed at Lindenmeyer's head
Lindenmeyer carefully removes one of the neural connectors from Parker's skull cap
Before removing another, he looks for a safe place to put the connector
need you to hold this
It can't get any dirt on it
Madison is reluctant, but doesn't know what else to do
Lindenmeyer slowly gives the neural connector to her free hand
( ' ) All you have to do is hold the needle at the base
Just make sure not to jab yourself with the point
She clutches the needle in her left hand while aiming her gun with her right
Lindenmeyer removes a second neural connector from Parker's skull
Holding this second needle at the base, Lindenmeyer makes several adjustments on the neural management computer, then moves slowly back to Madison
(') Hand me the connector nice and
He suddenly jabs his neural connector into Madison's right forearm
Madison has no time to react
10,000 volts of electricity instantly courses through her body
Madison drops to the floor, unconscious
The needle she had been holding falls from her grasp, breaking the circuit
She stops being electrocuted
Which saves her life
(' ) (as Sid 6
7 had said) God, some people are stupid
He sits back down at the simulator's main console, and starts to type commands
On the monitor, Parker is visible exiting the shopping mall
: Parker races out the door
That was left knee cap
He tumbles to the street
His gun flying from his hand
Parker crawls desperately toward his weapon
But not fast enough
Sid 6
7 arrives at the weapon first
6
7 So close, and yet, so far
He kicks the weapon down the sidewalk, then points his gun at Parker's head
6
7 (') It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale
thought you liked me being in the audience
Don't you want me to see it
Sid 6
7 pauses to think about it
6
7 (considering the idea) You know,  do want you to see it
He shoots Parker in his other knee cap, rendering both of his legs useless
6
7 (') want you to have a bird's eye view
- 67 story monument to engineering brilliance in this land of earthquakes
6:30
The view is incredible
You can see from the Pacific to downtown
From  to the Hollywood Bowl
Smog must be getting better in the near future
Sid 6
7 ties Parker to a chair at the roof's very edge
He is facing downtown
Including the Biltmore Hotel, the location of Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally
6
7 There you go  best seat in the house
(with some surprise) You are going after Mayor Bennett
6
7 Let's just say 'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally
He walks toward an open stairway door behind them
Aren't you going to watch with me
6
7 've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly
Time is moving backwards
Literally
Sid 6
7 pauses, then goes over to Parker and checks his watch
It is also moving backwards
smile of realization spreads slowly across Sid 6
7's face as he admires the beautiful sky above him
6
7 (as if to God) Thank-you, Daryl
(turning to Parker) You had me going for quite a while there, sport
What are you talking about
6
7 really did think  was still in reality
At least, until now
(looking upward) Beam me up, Scotty
His body  before your eyes
It's electronic particles form into an amorphous cloud
Which disappears from view
(yelling) Madison, get me out of here
Lindenmeyer watches Parker scream on the monitor
Madison remains unconscious on the floor behind him
(to the monitor) She's taking a nap at the moment
He types a set of instructions into the console and hits (' ) But don't worry
You won't be alone for very long
Fairly soon, you'll be dead
He removes the Sid 6
7 character module from its slot and exits the station
One side of Parker's chair gradually starts to rise
Parker looks down to see the roof surrealistically swelling beneath his chair
This could only happen in virtual reality
In a matter of minutes, he is going to be thrown over the roof's edge
The next stop is 693 feet down
Parker's screams for help  throughout the facility
But there is no one there to hear him
: The garbage truck is parked in a loading dock
Lindenmeyer climbs awkwardly onto the truck, then into the compactor
Lindenmeyer wades through trash until he comes upon Sid 6
7's headless body
The polymer neural net visible within its neck
Lindenmeyer inserts Sid 6
7's character module into its gelatinous base
But nothing happens
Come on, live
Live
The synthetic nervous system begins to crackle with life
Growing around the module
Forming the beginnings of a new head
Literally
: sitting precariously on the increasingly-uneven roof of the Hollywood Tower in virtual reality
Unable to break free of his binds, he rocks the chair onto its side
He and the chair fall to the roof, which will keep him from falling to his death for another minute, if he's lucky
' Madison, still unconscious on the floor, finally stirs
Maybe Parker's screaming is finally reaching her
Or at least, starting to
: Lindenmeyer looks on with awe as Sid 6
7 grows a new head right before your eyes
You've never seen anything like it
Sid 6
7's resulting head is slightly off center
His skin tone isn't perfect, nor is his color, but at least its functional
Sid 6
7 admires himself in a broken mirror
6
7 am beautiful, aren't
Of course you are
Sid 6
7 wades through the trash toward Lindenmeyer
6
7 How can  ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl
Help me get out of here
6
7 Glad to
He reaches out to give Lindenmeyer a hand, then grabs him by the throat
Choking him
Lindenmeyer can't believe what is happening
(gagging) What
are you doing
Sid 6
7 takes Lindenmeyer's face gently in his hands
6
7 You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived
(a beat) What do you think 'm doing
'm begging you
please don't kill me
Please
6
7 (reassuringly) Don't worry
Through me, you will live forever
As Lindenmeyer begins to scream, we : hanging on by his fingertips to the bulbous roof of the Hollywood Tower
He's going to fall at any second
: ' of someone entering Lindenmeyer's station in
You can't tell who it is, at first
But you can see the person is male
And wearing Lindenmeyer's pants
You now see the person is Sid 6
7
' Madison forces herself into consciousness
- Or as close to it as she can get
Her expression is one of complete and utter terror
6
7 Dr
Carter  've been hoping we'd get a moment together
Mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several of the computers which make up the simulator
Sid 6
7 advances calmly toward her
6
7 (') You know so much about me,  was hoping to learn a little bit about you
You see, 'm doing research, too
He looks behind the computers where you last saw Madison
She is no longer there
Sid 6
7 begins searching for her
He passes a virtual reality monitor on which Parker can be seen clinging for life
6
7 (') (to the monitor) Hang in there, Parker
On the monitor, Parker looks all around him, trying to determine the voice's origin
Madison crawls out of Lindenmeyer's station
Sid 6
7 just catches sight of her, and goes after her
Madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides
She is still very dizzy
And trying to keep the sound of her breathing to a minimum
Sid 6
7 enters quietly
hunter on the prowl
Moving very slowly
Then lunging very swiftly
He continues the hunt
If Madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer
Her heart pounds
Her forehead perspires
Sid 6
7 is getting closer
Sid 6
7 checks inside closets
Cabinets
Anywhere large enough for a human being to fit
He is practically standing over her
Looking
Listening
6
7 How does it feel to know you're going to die
What are you thinking about
Lights in the building suddenly come on
Several engineers can be heard entering
It's 8   the start of a new day
The facility is quickly becoming populated
After giving one last look around, Sid 6
7 reluctantly gives up the hunt, and exits
Madison does not move until she is certain Sid 6
7 has left the building
(0
) Madison scrambles out of her hiding place
: finally losing his grip on the roof of the Hollywood Tower in virtual reality
He plummets with accelerating speed
Madison bursts through the partition around Lindenmeyer's station
Sacrificing her body
Without regard for pain
Parker tumbles toward the sidewalk 67 stories below
The speed is terrifying
Madison leaps over a table
Diving for the simulator's button
Parker falls faster
And faster
The street just beneath him
The instant before he slams into the street, his body ' Madison keeps pressing the return button over and over, making sure it worked
Parker's eyes flutter as he returns to consciousness
Madison rushes to him
You okay
(shaking out the cobwebs) think so
You
(looking over her bruises) More or less
Lindenmeyer
My guess is dead
Sid
don't know
Several engineers peek in curiously at them
(') Let's get out of here
She helps Parker to his feet
: at a payphone outside a minimall
Could be any one of the 10,000 in Los Angeles
It's late morning
(on the phone) Elizabeth Deane, please
Tell her it's Parker Barnes
: ' Elizabeth Deane picks up the phone
Barnes, where the hell have you been
Trying to find out where the bomb is
Where the hell have you been
What did you find out
Call off the manhunt looking for me

It's already been called off
Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter
(a beat) Did you find out where the bomb is
No, but 've confirmed the reelection rally is the target
(a beat) How much -4 is missing
Enough to level an entire city block
If  were you, 'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel
(with frustration) Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel
don't know where
(interrupting) Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area
Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates
(a beat) Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena
You know how much man power you're talking about
You're the highest law enforcement official in the country
Use the fucking army if you need to
He hangs up the phone
: checking every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into Dallas Arena
The effort is massive
Intensive
The clock is ticking
6:00 and counting
: , The area has been converted into a security checkpoint
Entrants are carefully scanned onebyone
the rally : Security is on extreme alert
Tension is very high
It's 7:00
Parker, Madison, and Deane look on, anxiously
They listen to a   monitoring the conversations between the demolitions teams
(to Parker) This better not be a wild goose chase
Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today
(sharply) Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell
Give him a break, would you
(from scanner) This is demo team 27 leader think we just found what we've been looking for
: threeman demolition team slowly, carefully disarms the bomb Sid 6
7 had secured to the automated sewer cleaning vehicle
Snip
One wire at a time
Snip
The work is very delicate
Snip
One wrong move and it's all over
Snip
One more and we're home free
Snip
The three members of the demo team look up proudly to each other
Breathing sighs of relief
It's 7:42
: Parker, Madison, and Deane remain glued to their scanner

) (from scanner) Hey folks, it's time to crack open a cold one
Cheers are heard around the area from the other cops who'd been listening in
Thank God
(

) Then again, maybe we ought to hold off for just a second
(with concern, into radio) What's the problem
: The Team Leader carefully removes a piece of paper which had been taped to the timing mechanism
Written in handwriting, you read: , ,
The good news is, we're finished here
The bad news is
: Deane stares at Parker with disbelief
Deane's Aide, holding a cellular phone, approaches Parker
You've got a phone call
Parker grabs the phone
(expecting it to be Sid) You son-ofabitch, 'm going to kill you

) (through phone) Me
What did  do
: Alexiev Borgen sits with a dismantled  keyboard in front of him
(a beat) 'm sorry,  thought you were somebody else
've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool thought you should know
(a beat) The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident
The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose
Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it
Jesus Christ
(turning to Madison) know who the dominant personality is
(a beat) Lindenmeyer
Madison's reaction is one of panic
She bolts toward their squad car with all the speed she has
Parker chases after her
(') Where the hell are you going
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had
She gets into the driver's seat
Parker the passenger's
Madison punches the gas
: The members of the
Philharmonic tune-up for the evening's payperview extravaganza
Several teenage musicians sit with them
Lights, cameras, and production trucks are all over the place
This really is going to be one hell of a show

7 who is dressed in a tuxedo, knocking on the door to Guest Conductor's Dressing Room
(0
5
) (German accent) It won't do any good to rush me need my time to prepare myself
The door is opened by the  , who is dressed in a tuxedo, as well as large earrings
His hair is long and red
His complexion is pale, nearly white
And his eyes are piercing green
You might describe this look as punk meets classical
(annoyed beyond belief) Are you just going to stand there, or do you want something
Shaking with concentration, Sid 6
7 turns his hair red
(Nanoorganisms can do this, as well as the following
) He then grabs his hair and pulls it out, extending it to the exact length of the guest conductor's
Sid 6
7 then changes his complexion to match the conductor's
As well as his eye color, and other facial features
The Guest Conductor can't believe his eyes
By the time Sid 6
7 is finished modifying himself, he may not be an exact duplicate of the guest conductor, but even his mother would have to look twice
6
7 It's show time
He shoves the Guest Conductor back into his Dressing Room
Sid 6
7 follows him in, revealing a suppressed
38
He the door behind him
: Madison speeds recklessly through traffic toward the Hollywood Bowl
Parker doesn't notice
He's totally focused on screaming into the police radio
Listen to me, a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl
Evacuate everybody
'm sorry, sir,  don't have the authorization to do that
Then put somebody on who does
What's seems to be the problem
You've got to stop the concert bomb is going to go off
'm sorry, sir, the concert has already started
: whose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a truly magnificent performance of Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony inside the Hollywood Bowl
The Guest Conductor waves his baton wildly
Passionately
Brilliantly
Getting the absolute best from the members of the orchestra
The musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to their musical limit
As the Guest Conductor turns to the next page of his sheet music on the podium, you notice seven small, - above an upcoming musical measure
The sensors are wired together
When the seven notes are played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered down the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath the stage
The wires connect to several crates of C4 positioned beneath the orchestra
These seven notes will be the last notes these musicians ever play
: Madison  the vehicle to a halt
She comes within inches of mowing down several people
Madison and Parker bolt to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards
The Guest Conductor's movements grow even more intense
More demanding
As he looks to the violin section, we now see the conductor's face
It is Sid 6
7
6
7 (silently) Don't hold back
Give it to me
Give it to me
The orchestra plays with everything they've got
They hit every note perfectly
Including a high
' The first sensor is triggered
Then the second
appear at the back of the stage
Guns raised
Distracting the musicians
As Parker and Madison charge through the horn section toward Sid 6
7, the musicians stop playing
' The fifth sensor is triggered
Then the sixth
But not the seventh
6
7 cannot believe his eyes
Or his ears
The entire orchestra has stopped
6
7 Come on, play
In his rage, his face contorts "past points", which can only be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror
The musicians stare at Sid 6
7, and then at Parker and Madison with concerned, confused silence
Which is broken by Parker's gunfire
Ducking behind the podium, Sid 6
7 desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually
Without luck
He takes his
38 out of his jacket and starts firing
Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl
Audience members run in every direction
The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but keep their instruments with them
Even the oboist
Preventing Parker and Madison from taking any further shots at Sid 6
7
Sid 6
7 bolts down into the crowd
Madison cannot get off a clean shot
Neither can Parker
He aims, but does  fire
He and Madison struggle through the crowd after him
Parker and Madison just catch a glimpse of Sid 6
7 as he rushes up the entrance ramp to the Hollywood Freeway
Parker and Madison bolt after him
Parker and Madison race past the cars waiting to merge into what is effectively a parking lot
As is normal for this thoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill
Sid 6
7 is nowhere to be seen
Parker and Madison splitup, wading through different lanes of traffic
Startling the already frustrated motorists
Who roll up their windows
Lock their doors
And some of whom reveal weapons of their own
Madison pauses, listening
She has no idea that Sid 6
7 steps behind her
He cold cocks her with the butt of his gun
Madison crumples to the street
Which now leaves Parker a clean shot at Sid 6
7's head
Two hits
Two head wounds
Sid 6
7 falls behind a truck, losing his weapon
Before Sid 6
7's wounds have finished regenerating, Parker is already on top of him
(neighborly) Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again
He empties his clip into Sid 6
7, then discards the gun
As Sid 6
7's wounds heal themselves, Parker pounds him mercilessly
6
7 (losing it) You
ruined
' Trading blows, he manages to get to his feet
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend
6
7 (exploding) , '
He knocks Parker back with a good shot to the face, then disappears around a van
Parker continues the hunt
Quietly
Carefully
Tension grows in the silence that follows
He carefully makes his way around a truck
Only to see Sid 6
7 swinging a two-by-four directly at his head
Parker is knocked on his ass
Daze4
Blood streams down his cheek
He staggers to his feet, blocking another blow with his arm
Which  the wood in two
Parker grabs one of the boards
He battles with Sid 6
7
The fight between Parker and Sid 6
7 is intense
Exhausting
Parker gives it everything he has
Madison appears behind Parker, holding his gun
She wavers, having trouble keeping her balance
She has even more trouble aiming her weapon
Hey, Parker
She moves around, trying to get a clean shot at Sid 6
7
Which she does not have
How's your pulse
(totally focused) couldn't tell you
Then shoot him already
Duck
Without hesitation, Parker hits the deck
Leaving Sid 6
7 completely exposed
Madison steadies her sight
6
7 (to Madison) You couldn't hit the side of a
As he raises his twobyfour high over Parker's head, Madison pulls the trigger smoothly
, you follow the bullet as it exits the barrel of her gun
And penetrates Sid 6
7's skull between the eyes and exits out the back of his head
Sid 6
7 collapses on the ground next to Parker
What do we do now
You won't want to watch
Turn around
She does so
Parker reaches    to remove the Sid 6
7 character module from within his skull
Then reveals the character module in hand
What should we do with it
Glancing in the flatbed of a truck, Parker gets an idea, and knocks on the driver's window
As the  rolls down his window, classic  &   can be heard from inside
Mind if  borrow a couple of your tools for a second
Be my guest
Parker removes two sledgehammers from the back of the truck
He offers one to Madison
Care to join me
Madison gladly accepts takes the sledgehammer
Parker drops the Sid 6
7 character module onto the pavement
And together, they start pounding the shit out of it
In perfect time with the music
Which the driver cranks even louder
As we
