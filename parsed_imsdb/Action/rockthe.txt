At ease, Gentlemen
It is traditional for me to meet with my officers before an operation
The heart performs one thing, the legs another, the brain another - all better function together or the body becomes ill, is prone to disease
(beat) Major Baxter, Gunny Crisp and have been on the front lines since 'Nam
' Captain Hendrix was my adjutant in the Gulf
Get a haircut, Pete, you're lookin' like a beatnik
(the crew-cutted  smiles Captain Frye, Captain Darrow
) You and your men are new to me
Would the General like a recitation of our service records
'm well aware of your service records, Captain, they are excellent
want to be clear on why you - why all of us are here
You both stand to profit from this
Profit is not my motive, sir
am here to redress a wrong
Yes, sir, and to learn some people a lesson
This country has places where wrongs are redressed, Captain Darrow: They are called courts of law
In the military, they are called Courts Martial
This country has places where lessons a-re leaned
They are called schools
Am  confusing you
Well, sir, frankly
see that  am ' (beat) The only accurate term for what we are doing here is treason
Plain and simple
An insurrection against a government to which we have sworn allegiance
Everyone in this room must understand that
Hummel looks from face to face, studying each
The question is what kind of traitor are we
Coward or lion
Benedict Arnold, or Thomas iefferson
have posed that question to myself, have answered it, and my conscience is clear
Have all of you
' Yes, sir
Within thirty-two
hours you will leave this country and not return
All of you can live with that
(unison) Yes, sir
Well,  cannot
So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead,  will stay
The men exchange surprised glances
But General, you'll be prosecuted
Yes, Captain
And  plan on conducting my own defense
it will make the
Simpson trial look like an episode of "Perry Mason

-   - Many people around a table, each with a  on Hummel: Director Womack (still in tuxedo),
agent Margie Wood, White House Chief of Staff  , National Security Advisor , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs   , Air Force General , and
Director
Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen
rockets

Here he is in Vietnam -  think a Major at the time

Saved his whole company
Hence the nickname "gunfighter

Anybody read it
No
Give me the skinny
The "skinny," Mr
Sinclair, is that the
should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives
happen to share General Hummells view
The door opens
pokes his head in
General, it's him
The call connects to a phone on the table
Frank, this is Albert Kramer
Hello Al
Howlre Judy and the kids
They're fine
'm with General Peterson,
Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and
Director Amway
You've got a lot of people worried, Frank
Can you help us out
-  and  as necessary
'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China
Southern China
We never admitted we sent troops into China
There is a pause
Who is that
Identify yourself
Everyone stares at sinclair
White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General
How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair
'm thirty-three
Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy
General, put some duct tape over Mr
sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth
He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time
Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers: The President calling from Moscow
Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice
Continue Frank
Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador
Remember the Gulf War
Those pretty "smart bomb" pictures on
My men lased those targets
Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen
No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred
These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial
(beat) This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman "Red Sea Trading Company" account to an account  designate
From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families
The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses
Am  clear
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company
What is that
Identify yourself
Director Womack, General
You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales
Frank, Jesus, this is classified information
(stunned) Is this true
General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes
If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from
Good luck
Hayden Sinclair returns to the table
General, 've just spoken to the President and he is clear as hell on this: We will not negotiate with you and we do not care if
Someone please gag that man
(beat) Alert the media,  launch the gas
Refuse payment,  launch the gas
It is just after midnight
You have 36 hours - all of today and half of tomorrow, until 12 noon - to transfer the money
Don't even consider the standard counter measure, General
What's the potential casualty rate of a single rocket armed with
, General Peterson
In a dense urban area, sixty, seventy
Well that's not so bad
Thousand
Seventy thousand
Dead
one teaspoon will kill all living organisms in a three story office building
Get the point
What did Hummel mean by ",standard countermeasure," General
Napalm
Standard pgison gas can be neutralized by napalm
It burns it up -- consumes it upon detonation
The problem is that
gas is ten times more toxic and designed to withstand napalm
Hummel must know about Willy Peter, General
'Course he does
(explaining to others) "Willy Peter," short for "White Phosphorous Incendiary Device," still in its test phase
It detonates at 6,000 degrees, enough to burn up
(dawning on him) That explains Hummells time frame
He knows we're not operational
What would it take, General
To equip a flight of -16s with Willy Peter in 36 hours
An act of God
(off Kramer's look) All right, we can try
But view the use of Willy Peter as a secondary initiative
Then on to our primary initiative

Likewise on a frontal, seaside attack: at the first shot, Hummel might launch
My second in command is working on an attack from within the prison

But  need better intelligence
You've studied the architectural plans
They're useless
Alcatraz was originally a Civil War fort
It's been ripped up and rebuilt for years
Under there is a maze of shit, excuse my language

Director Womack, who gives a very significant look to

The following is a state secret
Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution
His name is John Mason
British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962, escaped in 1963
Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz
'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez
Do not argue and do not question
He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976
He's been held at Wolfburg since
He has no identity
He does not exist
Understood
(turns to Sanchez) want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels
You want him conscious or unconscious afterward
Don't even entertain it
This man laughs at strong arm tactics
dodium pentathol doesn't work either
Why's he going to help us now
(hands Womack ) Mason's papers are in order, sir
Because 'm willing to give him what he wants,  - a full pardon
Steep price for some information

Sanchez glares at Mason
Just some questions about Alcatraz
It's a tourist attraction now
You remember Alcatraz, Mason
The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason
Do  remember Alcatraz
Not the island itself
The tunnels underneath it
Real subtle,
There's no harm in cooperating with us
Who's "us

Why should  do that
Maybe there's a gift in it for you
(to the mirror) Timeo danaos et dona ferentes
smiles slightly: " fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts
" Are you capable of reading, Sanchez

Suddenly, over a wall-mounted : (

Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail

Impressive, Sanchez
You mind if

So much for Goodspeed's confidence
No actually, 'm Bill Goodspeed

Mason, we really need your help
That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office

So  how long have you been out

And you didn't call
You are free now, right

Why now
mean why today
was driving through San Francisco

Well there's not a lot  know about you other than you escaped from San Quentin, had a four day affair with my mother, and 'm the result
You can imagine 'm pretty confused

Then he's keeping it to himself
He's fucking with me and  don't have the time
(pause; he thinks) What if he went with you
Out of the question
He'll endanger the mission - he'll endanger my men
He's a security risk
Who says he won't bolt as soon as we turn our backs on him
'll handle that
Chaney
The hulking Chaney escorts  over
You're not cooperating, John
Maybe this will help

Well, the thermal imaging photos picked up the poison gas
Here
The prison morgue

makes sense
gas begins to lose its toxicity at higher temperatures
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices
No sir, but 've studied them

You're in the Bureau, so you've had weapons training
little, sir
So you've never been in a combat situation
No sir

Shepherd react to the sudden illumination above

(
) Drop your weapons
The
s, terrified, hesitate but do not drop their weapons They stand back-to-back, weapons trained at the catwalk
squinting into the white light
The
s behind the tiled columns take cover
we cannot yet see Hummel and the marines
This plays with as much tension as possible
The situation is chilling: Anderson here, General Hummel
Commander
Team Leader
(
) Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men, you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck at their feet- 39   - - We see the floodlights above on the Mezzanine and hear Hummells voice: Oh Christ this isn't happening

Baxter's text to him
The other marines are at positions around the mezzanine perimeter, -16's trained and ready
Sir, we know why you're out here
God knows  agree with you sir, but like you sir,  swore to defend this country against all enemies
Foreign, sir, and domestic

You know goddamn well that cannot give that order

Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander
'm not going to ask again

Don't do anything stupid, Commander
No one has to die here
You men following the General: You are United States Marines and under oath you forgotten that
We all have shipmates we remember - some of 'em were shit on and spit on by the Pentagon - that doesn't give you the right to mutiny
That's a nice speech, Commander
heard plenty like it in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill
They all added up to zero
Pretty words aren't gonna get you out of this, Commander
Now abort this mission
Goddamn it, abort

They gamely return fire

Thinking fast, rips the   from Shepherd's helmet, takes his 9 and  , and his -   , and climbs down
Goodspeed, indecisive at first, clambers down after Mason

Anderson has fallen, so this is at ground level
We see corpses and near corpses
It's over
We've still got movement
Numbers eleven and twelve

They huddle, speaking in hushed voices
You told me  am on a "need to know" basis
Well goddamn it, need to know
Who the fuck is John Mason
Start talking, Director, or swear  will go to the press

Then Womack sighs, and his voice travels back three decades

Edgar Hoover is head of the

It's no secret the esteemed Mr
Hoover kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans
de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the Prime Minister
The man had dirt on everyone in the world, A174

He is a different person
Alive
Now in his element

Inspects it
Unsheathes the saw-toothed knife
Sheathes it
174  -  39   / The British sent over their best operative, John Mason, to steal it
grabs Shepherd's machine gun, pops the clip
Our agents caught at the Canadian border but with no microfilm
It's never been found
So Hoover held him without trial
The British claimed they didn't know him
What about the daughter
why didn't Hoover use her as leverage
He died in 1972
She wasn't born yet Today it's a different Bureau and no one wants to touch this
My god, you're not saying
slides the clip back in the machine gun
Tests the action
obviously comfortable with firearms
John has been incarcerated without trial on American soil since 1962
He knows our most intimate secrets of the last half century
The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the
assassination

trained killer, one of -6's best operatives ever - John was one of the most dangerous men on earth

Don't shoot me

For christ's sake

Goodspeed follows him
Wait
Where're you going
Off this island
You mind
Yes  mind

From the tac radio in Mason's hand: (

You've got a phone call

) What is happening
Where's Mason
He says he's leaving the island sir
Don't let him do that
He's got a gun, sir
What do you have, a
Get him back
hurries off after Mason
-   - Commander Anderson and the

Hummel, Baxter walk amongst the corpses

Jesus christ
We knew it might happen, Frank
Maybe now they'll pay up
Maybe now they won't
Then maybe we'll execute a few hostages
One

He's gurgling blood
Staring up at Hummel
You'll go to hell for this General

Royce) Put a bullet in him
Pvt
Royce, appalled, can't bring himself to do it
You heard him
End it
Cpt
Darrow pulls his sidearm and levels it

(lowers sidearm) Yes sir
Royce kneels
Feels Dandols carotid artery
He's dead anyway sir
Hummel leans down
Stares into Dando's video feed

Just stop

And they sprint back, the way they came

The gas bomb detonates, blowin'g a wall of flame through the tunnel
The fire is looking for an escape, hunting and burning everything in its path
- see the wall of flame toward them grabs Goodspeed
Hold your breath
They dive into a pool of stagnant water, submersing as the blows through the tunnel over their heads
Mason, then Goodspeed, drags himself out of the water
Come on
And keep your mouth shut
hurries off,  on his tail

The tunnel's bricked up; brick and mortar circa 1855

You're going to help me
No
'm going to give you dancing lessons
What the fuck do you think
You don't have to get all bent out of shape
What's bent out of shape, idiot, is the tunnel  was going through to freedom five minutes ago
All right, all right
Don't call me idiot, okay

Stop

He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed

Hendrix raises the knife
With his last strength,  rolls away

Royce lowers the knife
Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed
The ditch is 20 ft

Pretty easy killing an unconscious man
How about trying me

There's only one way to find out
'll try to give you time
And Goodspeed

Put that on

Well thank-you, thank-you very much
creeps toward the China Alley rocket launcher

Looks up through the grate
The sits on the grate on the level above him
- walks down the middle of the cell block toward the opening to the exercise yard
-   -    - Darrow with his gun to Larry Henderson's head
Hummel paces in the background
emerges ftom the cell block
walks up to Hummel
The two stand there a moment, regarding each other
Gotta be kidding me
They send an old man
gives Darrow a hard-eyed glance
Hummel takes a lap around Mason, sizing him up
thought 'd been in the service a long time
Name and rank, sailor
John Paul Mason
(stares at Hummel) Royal Navy
Commander
You're a long way from England, Commander Mason
feel strangely at home
How's that
You wouldn't believe me if  told you
Do you have some unique knowledge of this prison facility, Commander Mason
Quite unique
How's that

Someone laughs
Everyone laughs

Looking down, he sees  and Cox
He cinches his   to the steel railing
-   -  - Well you're some kind of joker, Mason
Maybe you're a lunatic
Are you of sound mind, Mason
'm not threatening the lives of a million innocent people
You are
Hummells demeanor changes
Hard now
Tight
Give me the guidance chips
threw them in the bay
That was stupid of you
(re: hostage Henderson) Would you have shot him7 : The marines look at Hummel, wondering the same thing
220 -  , still holding Cox at bay, pulls the
chem round from the rocket
The going is slow
he begins to lift the    from the chem round
His hand reaches to unclip the
Suddenly
repels to the level behind Goodspeed
Goodspeed grabs the chip and dashes off, slamming through an    into the

The previous question dangles in the air: Would you have shot him
You seem like a bright man, Commander
Bright men understand necessity
Bright men also obey the law

" John Locke
"Where there is no law, there is no transgression
" The Bible
Romans, Chapter 4, Verse 15
Article 7, American Constitution
"Treason against the United States shall consist of
11 The American Constitution was written by traitors, Commander
Traitors against a government founded on injustice and tyranny and stupidity
(beat) see little difference in my motivation
- Goodspeed, inside the Civil War ruins, levels his gun at the door
The chip is in his free hand
The door  open
-  - Do you, Commander Mason
Suddenly
Coming from China Alley
Hummel and men whirl around, startled
Frye, Crisp, go
- wildly discharges his gun until , the clip is spent
Cox and McCoy step through the doorway
shoves the guidance chip in his mouth
Swallow that and  swear on my Aunt Myrtle's grave 'll cut your belly open and pull it out
McCoy and Cox spring at Goodspeed
McCoy whips the butt end of his gun against Goodspeed's head
crumples, unconscious
McCoy jams his fingers in Goodspeed's mouth
He bit the fuckin' thing
It's shot

Gets to his feet
Goes to the bars: Mason
(no response) Mason
(
) It's about time
Where are you

Above you
(under his breath) Literally and figuratively
, we see that '  has been ripped into long strips
is    into a long rope
The rope is quite finely constructed
Mason's been at this several hours
(and during the following, keeps busy with his rope braiding)
This is tiny
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed
Or another portion of your anatomy
The cell, Mason
Five feet by seven
Try living in one for a year
What happened
only got one chem round
There are two left
fucked up
(sarcastic) Surprise, surprise
'm not a field agent, all right
So cut me a break
An
Man asking me for a break
How droll
What is your beef with the Bureau, anyway Clmon
Tell me
Let's say our countries had a little dispute
They both knowingly shafted me

The entire island is to be blanketed

No one can survive it
(grimly) That's why this is a volunteer mission, Captain
If any of you have doubts you can carry it out, speak up
The pilots look at each other
Silence
Captain Giler
We jerry-rigged a release lever
You'll find it on the left side of the cockpit
It's got two positions: safety and release
Throw it on release, the bomb drops in five seconds
Change your mind, throw it back on safety
Any questions

between the two cells again
Jesus
(thinks) Why didn't you just tell Hoover and the bureau where the microfilm was
Make a trade
Some trade
They'd get the microfilm and 'd get a bullet in the head

Something's been on my mind
About your escape

leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell block
The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length
(cont'd) only ask because, in our current situation, it might be useful information
The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the rolling caster tied to it
holds the other end of the rope through the bars of his cell
Trade secret, Billy, 'll tell you this:	it was easier than getting in
fiercely yanks the rope toward him
The heavy rolling caster jerks from the floor
The , pulling the rope, flies past Mason's cell -- -- shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling the rope, where -- -- the caster-pulled  catches the    against the wall
The rope coils,   , around the release lever handle

Then he pulls slowly and delicately

You're on your own, kid
Your gear's over there

Shit
grabs his guns and gear and follows after Mason

-    -  Hummel sits behind the desk
Baxter, Frye, Darrow, Hendrix in front of him
Silence
Hummel stares at his phone
The tension is palpable
Time
(consults his watch) Fifteen minutes Frank
We have two operational rockets left, General
One on the lower lighthouse, one on the rooftop, ready for fire

heard you Captain
Prepare for launch General
General
Not yet
General Hummel, noon is approaching
'm aware of the time, Captain
Hummel glares at Frye, then at the phone
Frye and Darrow
exchange a look
: -   -  The clock on the wall reads 11:47
13 minutes to go
General Kramer, Security Advisor Louis Lindstrom, and
Director Milton Amway
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz
Seven hours ago
The Naval Attache enters excitedly
General, the white phosphorous attack is operational
General Kramer grabs the phone
Get me the President

Mason
John
( stops) What happened - the injustice done to you - doesn't mean you can walk away from this

Only one of them  care about
You were once a different man
You don't know what kind of man  was
You were a civil servant
Sworn to do your duty
Just like me
begins climbing down to the waterline
-    - Hummel, with Baxter, Hendrix, Frye, Darrow and Crisp
The atmosphere is now so fucking thick you can cut it
Eleven fifty-seven, General
Three minutes to go
They're going to call
They are not going to call General

They're calling our bluff
We have two operational rockets left
We have to stick one of those rockets in their ear, General

You didn't ever what
(no response) You didn't ever what, General
(gets in Hummel's face) General, forty-eight hours ago  was in a cushy job at Pendleton
As of this moment  am subject to prosecution for treason and murder
Do you know what that means
It means the electric chair
For all of us
He's right Frank
Authorize the launch or it's over
All eyes on Hummel now
Authorize the launch, General
Hummel nods and : -      - Capt
Frye and Sgt
Crisp approach the rocket launcher across the roof of the main cell house
-   -  Mason's wading into the water now
You'll never make it
once swam the English Channel, but you're entitled to your,opinion
Goodspeed, disgusted, turns and heads back, grumbling
Fine
'll fuckin, do it myself
- on the roof, ready the rocket launcher
Hummells  comes over Fryels walkie-talkie: (

The Fishermen exchange looks
Hold out their hands, catching "rain drops"

-   - Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair stands before the desk of the President of the United States
They need a decision Mr
President
The President (who we don't see) gazes into the East Garden
The President hits his  to the room where his cabinet is gathered
with the authorities, reactions, as needed: These past few hours have been the longest, darkest of my life
This is when you wish the buck did not stop here
(beat) balance between two tragedies
On one hand the fate of a million civilians
On the other, Frank Hummel
That we have ignored or abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel and that American boys have paid the price of that neglect in blood, is equally real, and equally tragic
The glass is half full not half empty, sir
No civilian casualties so far
don't believe in half full or half empty, Sinclair
There are chemical weapons and there are civilians
And there are men on Alcatraz wholve proved they're willing to use the one on the other
(beat) We are at war with terror
Fighting a war means casualties
This is the worst call 've ever had to make

through the slit, killing Baxter as -- , gunshot, reels toward the   behind him
He wrenches it open and lunges outside into the corridor

Hummel collapses against the wall
His blood runs across the tiled floor takes a defensive position in the washrooms doorway
attack through the infirmary's maze of rooms, taking cover where they can, squeezing off rounds
fires at Darrow and Frye from the doorway while kneels over Hummel
Hummells dying and knows it
he stares at Goodspeed through glassy eyes
My god what have  done
It's not too late, General
Tell me where the last chem round is

Do your job, Billy

Frye bolts from the room, s printing the other way
