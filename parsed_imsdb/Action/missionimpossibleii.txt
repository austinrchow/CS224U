"Mission: Impossible 2", shooting draft, by Robert Towne 2 By Robert Towne Revised
12/4/99 : " " : ( - ) is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black armband
exits a gleaming building, pausing for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 'Where the future is now' He checks the time
- set in Countdown Mode
It's at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37
15,  :14,  :13,  :12 etc
children are singing: Ring a ring a rosy/a pocketful of posy/ a tissue a tissue/we all fall down
Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent Natural History Museum
They are moving in and around an odd freeform sculpture
- a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, almost like mirrors in a fun house
wipes his eyes, a horn honks
He looks toward the sound
-  (
- ) on the belt that takes it thru -Ray
On the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small plastic container marked '
' - a small, square shiny object, hi-tech and at odds with the other items
She pulls out an urn- shaped vessel
What's this, then
(handing her documents) The ashes of a colleague, 'm taking them to his family
If you wish to open it, please be careful
(
-  - ) on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight point of departure in Sydney, continuously updating distance, direction and time to its ultimate destination, Atlanta, Georgia
' - folks, we're a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in Atlanta, but if you look out your windows on either side of the aircraft, we'll soon be crossing the southern section of the Rocky Mountains, a range which includes more than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet
The chain's loftiest point, Mount Elbert, at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over central Colorado shortly
(
- ) seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance
He checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending seconds whipping by
sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat beside Nekhorvich
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor
Well, yes
suppose  am a bit anxious
They're ready and waiting
You'll soon be with old friends
(meaning Ethan) 'm with an old friend now, Dmitri
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances
Yes, 'm sorry too
'You're sorry and 'm sorry
' (bemused laughter, then looks at Ethan) - you do know Gradski thought the world of you
Nekhorvich is overcome
Ethan puts a comforting hand on his shoulder: He was quite a man
Did he know before the end you two had succeeded
Yes, he knew
Just
not in time to save him
No
After you've lived with Chimera for twenty hours, nothing can save you
Not even
Bellerophon
Nekhorvich pats the satchel
You carry them together
Safely
With an almost impish grin and a wink: Yes, and you'll get us to a safe place with them, thank god
left to my own devices, 'm an old fart too inept to read a railroad timetable
Good-natured laughter
Cut off by a flight steward who passes by, giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvich's direction
Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling
Passengers are puzzled and alarmed
' You Captain again
We've experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure
passenger struggling with his mask
As Nekhorvich fumbles with the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping
He checks the countdown time on his watch again
Nekhorvich looks around him
The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out
- The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks
(into radio) Pan, pan, pan, Denver Center
This is Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven, 747 heavy
We are not reading you
We're unable to maintain cabin pressurization
We have initiated a descent to one six thousand
The Co-pilot is working on the plane's altitude when his hands slip off the controls
His eyes flutter, then: - Captain,  don't
can't
He passes out
The Captain,  , turns to verify that the relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls
He then removes his oxygen mask, sets the auto pilot, inputting numbers to slow the plane and descend
As the craft titles downward
- The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits
Stamp emerges from the cockpit
- Ethan returns
Nekhorvich beckons to him
Ethan sits
Grinning around, Nekhorvich conspiratorially: it seems we have a problem, Dmitri
(in the same tone) You keep calling me Dmitri
You really shouldn't
Nekhorvich's eyes narrow
You're not Dmitri
With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvich's neck
- no
He grabs the satchel
(cont'd) (to Wallis) Wallis, hold onto it
Wallis slashes the satchel handle open, takes the satchel for Ambrose
He peels off the latex mask, revealing
(cont'd) Ulrich, pull the - He tears off the vocal oscillator at his adam's apple, clears his throat, now as Ambrose: - pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence
(the 'captain' into shot) All done, chief
(what else) - right - (kidding) - don't go too far ahead of me now - Not possible
Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane
Stamp pulls back the panel, hops into the compartment below which is four walls of electronic equipment
Stamp kneels and slides back the floor hatch
The wind howls, puffs of cloud zip by beneath them
As they descend into the belly: Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand
Airspeed one-seven- niner knots
It's that time
Go
They don goggles and, with Ambrose in the lead, the team leaps, one after another from the hatch, sailing off into the sky
-  () An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone: Terrain, terrain
Pull up, pull up
The co-pilot stirs
He blearily rouses himself just in time to see: mountain rushing toward him
As mountain meets airplane, the frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame, which ignited, lights a fuse
The  theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to: -    () For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going
Aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below
Ethan climbs out of shot
() revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead
Ethan into shot
Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday
It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on the soundtrack
Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again
As he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter
It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan
Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him
But when its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his climb
(
- ) near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below
He's clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling
When he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion
Whoaa
He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang
- with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the summit
He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude
To lizard: You're welcome
The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention
He turns to see the source of the beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo streamer
Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back
Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter
With a distinct lack of enthusiasm
The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears
Ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses
' First, a retinal scan
Identity confirmed
Good morning, Mr
Hunt
Swanbeck's face flashes onscreen
Over his introduction of Nyah is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive she never seems to give the camera a clean shot
' Your mission, should you choose to accept it, requires you to recover a stolen item, designated Chimera
Essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian -- a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall
She is a highly capable professional thief currently active in Spain
series of Nyah's 'accomplishments', i
e
, warrants, complaints, Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities, as well as glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville
'  (cont'd) Her dossier's available on - 3
You have 48 hours to recruit Ms
Nordoff-Hall and meet me in Seville to receive further details
Should you or any member of your force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions
Swanbeck's face reappears on screen: '  (cont'd) And Mr
Hunt - the next time you go on vacation, please be good enough to let us know where you're going
This message will self-destruct in five seconds
Ethan removes the glasses, then tosses them into space
If  let you know where 'm going - The glasses explode in a puff of smoke
(cont'd) - won't be on holiday
Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit
Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his back-pack
Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries of flamenco dancers
: -   () Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen, exits her car and enters the villa
(-
-   - ) where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands wielding the castanets
The dancers perform on a raised platform and  -' face can be glimpsed thru the swirling skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them
- looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the crowed party
Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman
Nyah offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one another
Ethan approaches her
Do you know me
No
Should
No
You just looked as if you did
No
Just as if 'd like to
Oh
Well
think that can be arranged
Not tonight
Bad timing
Sorry - There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad
This stops her
Nyah moves closer to him, until they're nose to nose
Whispered but breezy: Look, it's either you or the rent and don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice
What if  pay the rent
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink then: Go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet - 'll pay your rent
(kissing him, sweetly) Now bugger off
And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of the dancer's steps to cover her own
Once upstairs, a security guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to Ethan
In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following
In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah
Ethan smiles, moves out of shot
-   () Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom
-  () decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored walls
The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of ice
Nyah can't resist
She spoons a dollop of the caviar and downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to its back
There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, revealing an electronic density meter
She turns it on and holds it at the rear of the tub
Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from green thru yellow and into red
(her fondest hopes confirmed) Mmmm
She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the tiles just above the sop dish
Her knee eyes search for any cracks in the grout and she spots one
Using a tweezers she pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles
She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish
There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble casing out from the rear of the tub
Nyah breathes a sigh of relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked compartments
As she studies them: Decisions, decisions
Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub
What are you doing here
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock
(not altogether pleased) see
You're not just another pretty face
Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto
(cont'd) Oh god
bloody baritone
Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror
She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the tub, pulling him down on top of her
Once again they're nose to nose
take it you prefer tenors
She glances up at the mirror
In it is the reflection of ', a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it
He breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and disappears from the dressing room mirror
Would you mind if 'm on top
Oh, either way works for me
With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara brush
She glances down and is rather disconcerted
Continues working with the pick and wrench
' You're never gonna find it there
(she jumps, dropping the torque wrench) Damn it
Find what
His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction Tuesday
Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation: more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's lower pelvic region as she straddles him
Not exactly in the mood to move: She stiffens - he knows too damn much
- right
where is it
Far right
She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the bottom right compartment
She's utterly nonplussed: Where's the bloody - (plucking it off his chest, offering it up like a mechanic under the chassis) - torque wrench
- this is very disconerting
Hey, you put me here
just do what 'm told
- right
She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque wrench and carbide pick - and it's open
She withdraws a velvet pouch and opens the pouch
Out spills the spectacular necklace
(cont'd) Lovely
(starting to close the safe) Who are you and what's it going to cost me
(having sat up) wouldn't do that
Do what
The alarm goes off
That
The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards, gun drawn Senor de l'Arena, looking highly upset, pops in
' Oh, Senor Keyes, thank God it is you
(in Spanish to security guards, annoyed) It's Senor Keyes, the security engineer
Well, Senor de l'Arena the goods news is that the heat sensors were activated
But Miss Nordoff-Hall, my associate - Senor de l'Arena kisses Nyah's hand
' Mucho gusto, senorita
- did feel that she had rather too long to work on the safe before they triggered the alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall
Oh yes
Absolutely
Much too long should yes
Nyah's initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary, intensified curiosity - about Ethan
Under the circumstances  think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load
How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall
Indeed
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer
we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow
Shall we
He offers Nyah his arm
They start out
Ethan immediately stops
(cont'd) Miss Hall
Haven't you forgotten something
Nyah looking genuinely puzzled
The necklace
Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering string of diamonds and rubies from her bust
' (a great kidder) What are you trying to do, senorita
Rob me
They all laugh, and Ethan's got her out the door
-   (  -  ) The stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue
Ethan and Nyah emerge from the villa, walking slowly
Nyah's clearly preoccupied
'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace
Even after botched the job,  could've walked out of there with the bloody thing
At least you walked
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it
Wanted to see how good you were
'm hoping we might work together
May  say something, no offence
You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind
Working under adverse conditions
Highly adverse conditions
Sounds smashing
'm in
Muchacho, mi carro, por favor
Now be serious
You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance
You didn't do that badly
Her car arrives
(as she moves to her car) You're apologizing for me
Quite the gentleman
(opening the car door) Not really
triggered the alarm
One foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to Ethan
Hey, the Bulgari job last week was flawless
And 've always been partial to pale yellows
She slides behind the wheel
(as he leads on the car) don't do laundry, or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine
She takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake
Ethan smiles and shakes his head
-  () around curves, hair flying, she's free
Her car phone rings
Perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up: (tentatively) Hola
Hi
Would you mind slowing down
Where did you get this number
don't even have it
' Would you like it
She hits the End button and disconnects
The phone immediately rings again
She refuses to pick up
Ethan pulls alongside hers
She looks at him
They speak through the open cars
Pull over and listen to me, will you
Just listen
Listen to what
need your help and  thin you can use mine
Your help
What are you talking about
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority
can make them go away
Oh bloody hell
You're a spy
She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan, nicking his car as she takes off
(to himself) deserved that
- Ethan rings her again
And keeps ringing
Her face becomes grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethan's pursuit progressively more determined
They are reaching the limits of adhesion around blind curves
() The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it
Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank and sees on his  what Nyah can't see thru the fog - less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of feet to rock and sea below
Ringing her number again: (half to himself) Slow down, slow down
She turns up a mound and loses control
She spins out and heads toward the edge of the cliff
(realizing she's in trouble) Uh-oh
Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin
Her car stops just at the cliff's edge
Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out
No
Suddenly there's no Nyah
Ethan leaps over to Nyah's car and sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below, holding the door handle
Oh
oh
Taking a firm grip on her wrist
Don't look down
Just
look at me
That's it
that's it
He pulls Nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into his arms
For a long moment it looks like she's in shock
Then: What's you name
Ethan Hunt
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about
Thru the veil of morning fog, Nyah looks at Ethan
Her dark eyes suggest wit, and willingness, and longing
more than  thought
They scarcely to move to bring their lips together: Awfully short notice
Care to wait a decent interval
Who wants to be decent
: -  (-
-  - -) sleeping
His eyes open slowly
He comes to full consciousness, his head still on the pillow
Something approaching serious anxiety informs his features
He lifts his head and looks at his left, angle widening
Nyah lies on her side facing him, sleeping serenely
Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isn't- approved-recruiting-technique, confirmed
He lets his head flop back on the pillow
Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to- profile
As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades, replaced by curiosity and even wonder
He lifts his hand and just brushes her cheek
Her eyes open
She knows where she is
So what've you got against spooks
Nyah smiles
When they've got your recruiting technique
Not a thing
Oh
Well
this isn't exactly by the book
They've got a book for this
They've got a book for everything
The only other spook  knew was a liar
Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth
He'd lie about his favorite color
But then  reckon it's an occupational hazard
All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar
That's not the point
In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't
Which is
That they're lying
Ethan laughs
(cont'd) once they know that they can get very very
crosee
Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan
So where did  got right
You're not a liar
Or you're an awfully good one
(then) this thing these blokes pinched
don't know that they 'pinched' it
Don't even know that they're blokes
Nyah stops to think about this
Well, then, what  am  doing here
assume 'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief
So do
Sort of
Nyah looks at Ethan, a little worried
Spoken like a spook
you ever afraid
Of what
Nyah laughs
Ask a question, you get an answer
Damn, you're beautiful
That's because 'm on my back
Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so she's looking down at him
don't think so
She sinks into his arms
- -  -  ( ) () Ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema portion of the Fallas de Valencia
On this night great papier mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires
Outside the bar Ethan's looking for there's a street vendor, hawking Fallas mementos and flowers
He starts past the vendor, and it hits him - he's going to buy some flowers
He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals
Ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar, and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet
Turns back to the vendor
Are you gonna be here a while
Si, senor
'll pick'em up on my way out, okay
Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where he passes security at a pair of double doors
- Swanbeck stands looking out the window
Noisy crowds from the festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid background thru briefing room's window
Fetival's a pain in the ass
Honoring saint by setting'em on fire
(turning to Ethan) Sit down, sit down
Ethan sits
(cont'd) Let's you know what they think of saints, doesn't it
Damn near set me on fire on my way over here
As if  haven't been burned enough today
moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two
Then civilly: (cont'd) Sorry  barged in on your vacation
Sorry  didn't let you know where  was
Don't be
Wouldn't be on vacation if you did
Well
You're sorry and 'm sorry
Why did you phrase it like that
Like what
'You're sorry and 'm sorry
' You gotta be kidding
Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a , and projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is: (with exaggerate brio) Well, Dmitri
How are you
Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply
Ethan smiles
'm fine
and you
'm fine
Ethan laughs
'm fine and you're fine
With Ethan simultaneously whispering: 'm fine too
'm fine and you're fine - do you remember, dear fried, how you got Sergei and  to repeat those lines from Dr
Strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly Soviet Premier because we didn't know your name
In those days, you not only saved our lives, you saved our sanity
'Now, then Dmitri - we have this little problem': Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain
Therefore, in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster Chimera
beg you, Dmitri, come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately
However we travel,  must arrive at me destination, within 20 hours of departure
Forgive this fanciful explanation, but for now prudence dictates that  communicate nothing but the gravest urgency
fear  can entrust this to no one but you, Dmitri
as we say, ''m sorry and you're sorry'
Swanbeck stops the
Let me ask you something
You have any idea what the hell he's talking about
Ethan smiles
An idea, yeah
Like
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry
And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier
So let's get on with it
He's still in Sydney
Dr
Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead
So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier
We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies
Ethan sits back, heavily
(cont'd) - Hunt, are you listening
Slowly looking up: If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight
You were there
Swanbeck clears his throat
He turns back to the computer and punches in: File open to computer scans of , , and , , the computer scanning and comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat, as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy scan, Ethan's face on Ambrose: hence, mission double image
slowly looks up at Swanbeck
When  couldn't find you,  had to replace you
Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice
He double you, what
Two, three times
Twice
What did you think of him
You know we had reservations about each other
Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that
Not necessarily
Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain
Airline record list Captain Harold Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207
as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned, Captain Macintosh died on the flight, but in fact he missed it
He did, however make the next flight - in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size
Another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers
(cont'd) Someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident
Someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but - they don't always get your luggage on the plane, even when you fly first class
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't
Then you do think it was Ambrose
Ethan barely nods
(cont'd) And you're not surprised
Ethan gives Swanbeck a look
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers
Ethan smiles
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground
The question is why
What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying
Ethan rises and moves to the window
Right now only Ambrose knows that
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us
In order to do that, 've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it
- right
In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts
'Terrorists
' Well you know Nekhorvich's history
You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane
Locating him in time to stop something like that - - is where Miss Hall comes in
(blindsided) Excuse me
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously
She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since
We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him
(acidly) And then what
Then makes sure she continues to see him
Gets him confide in her and report to you
You made it sound as if  was recruiting her for her skills as a thief
Well, then  mislead you
Or you made the wrong assumption
Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done
She's got no training for this kind of thing
Go to bed with a man and lie to him
She's a woman
She's got all the training she needs
Ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it
don't think  can get her to do it
You mean it'll be difficult
Very
Well it's not mission difficult, Hunt
It's mission impossible
Difficult should be a walk in the park for you
If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try
Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these
if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job
He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the one in Nekhorvich's bag at airport security)
Swanbeck sets it on the table
Ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye
-  () grim Ethan, starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever more lively crowd
as he does: Senor, senor
Your flowers
The vendor holds up the spring bouquet
Ethan seems genuinely surprised by them
Yes
They're very nice

carefully places the little Minolta on a glass-topped coffee table
She's beautifully pulled together, the safehouse has the lights low, flamenco music playing, and when she walks out onto the balcony Ethan sees the candlelit table and a bottle of champagne chilling
There's a light breeze the fire from the burning effigies throwing smoke and flame all over the city
What's the population of Seville any idea
Five, six-hundred thousand
There's nearly 2 million in London
And six billion in the world
That's lot of people out there
how many of them,  wonder, are capable of something like that
Sean Ambrose, for one
long shocked moment
Nyah laughs
Right
-  ( - ) The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room Nyah's back to Ethan: (grimly amused) Not that it matter much but
seem to recall you staying something like, ' was hoping we could work together
' This wasn't what  had in mind, Nyah
But it is what you'd like me to do
so tell me to do it
She approaches Ethan
They're inches apart
(cont'd) Come on, out with it
Tell me to go and insinuate myself back into Sean's life
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life
'd like a little more conviction
So would
But it's not mine to give
(archness there) You've either got it or you don't
Let your conscience be your guide
Something like that
With a smile and a wink
But  don't have a conscience
'm a bloody thief
You can be a thief and have a conscience
No
You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me
Why did you have to tell me about this
(pouring herself a drink) What do  have to do to get away from this guy
When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment
even now 'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where  am in the world but he does
And it looks like he's done it again
You know his definition of a  true paranoid
don't
Someone in possession of all the facts
(she turns away, pauses) Are you telling me  have to do this
Generally,  don't favor coercing someone
Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands
And that's the only reason
Can you think of a better one
Not me
was just hoping you might
or that
somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical
Look, would it make you feel better if didn't want you to do this
Much
Then feel better
Long moment while she looks at him
(cont'd) Well
That made all the difference in the world, didn't it
Ethan walks out onto the balcony
She looks at his back
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-'m- not-nad' message
Not after the way we broke up
What wouldn't make him suspicious
Probably that  needed him in some urgent way
destitute - in serious trouble
the kind  couldn't possible sort out myself
Ethan's been smiling slightly
Serious trouble, Nyah, is something  can always arrange
standing for front and side mug shot
sound of teletype continues
:  Ethan holding up something the size of a dime: This little chip sends a coded signal that can be picked up only by our computer
On the screen of the  computer, a little yellow blip appears pulsating on the screen
' When it's in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world
He types a small Interpol bulletin stating that Nyah Nordoff Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts and burglaries she's committed in the three cities
(   - ) Ambrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's put out
He leans over the screen for a moment, then moves to the window, and stares out thoughtful at the bay, almost as if he were watching
- From a beautiful blue sky,  pan down to the courtyard of the jail where Nyah is allowed out for an airing, seemingly alone but being watched by: His attention fixed on the screen, Ethan stares at satellite shot of Nyah in the jail courtyard

Cross cut with Ethan
Look,  can't run your arrest in , but guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much
Well,  mean it's not a total loss
It is keeping a very capable thief off the street
Very funny
maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know
Maybe he's lost interest

What lawyer
Well, here we go

Here Ethan pulls up names, photos and profiles of potential candidates
They scroll past, one face morphing into another
Ethan punches in on
: Qualified in virtually every mode of transport, land, sea, air
: Small arms and automatic weapons authority, edged and impact weapons
: Resourceful
: Precision detonation, diffusion
Ethan punches: Request immediate availability
-   -  () Nyah emerges from the entrance to the jail
Stop and look for something in you purse
kneel down
She does
They're effectively blocked from the street
Limo's waiting
Ethan hands her a key chain with what appear to be a car-key
- Ambrose will have counter-surveillance second to no one's
When and if he contacts you, push this button before you actually end up under his roof it'll scramble your transmission to us
She takes the key chain
Her hands are shaking
When will you be there
Before you are
How can you possibly
've got to get right on the plane
'm leaving now
You don't trust me
Oh,  do
But as we know 'm a very poor judge of character
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735
It's going to be delayed
Yes
You'll be fine
'm going to lose you
Ethan, you take care of yourself, 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, 'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice
Well, forewarned is forearmed
And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you
They rise
quick squeeze of her hand and he's gone
look of something like longing replaces the toughness as she gazes after him, then starts across the street toward the limo and driver music theme kicks in and continues over: ( -  - ) over the Harbor Bridge, sails dotting the bay like confetti
-  () pans of sheep are bleating and looking for sort of cover in response to the sound of a helicopter touching down
-  () Billy and Luther emerge, Luther with computer looking acutely uncomfortable in a wrinkled suit
' Welcome to Australia, mate
They look up to a smiling Ethan who points to the ground beneath Luther's feet
Luther looks down to see that he is standing in a pile of sheep-shit
Thanks - mate
Both men laugh and all three move to: -  () Luther and Billy with Ethan setting up their operation
There's a blip on one of the screens
It's the transponder
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual
The visuals aren't coming up
The satellite doesn't work as fast as do
Yeah, 've heard about you, Luther, and just want to tell you it's an honor and a pleasure to be working with you blokes, whoaa
That's some transponder
As Billy speaks, the visual come on line and Nyah has become visible
(a jaundiced eye, to Ethan) It certainly is
How did we get so lucky
Ethan pointedly ignore the question
-  (  - ) rounding the tip of the bay's crescent, revealing the beach and dock at Ambrose's palm-lined residence
The speedboat's engine's are cut
Nyah looks momentarily stricken
() a lone slender figure silhouetted at the end of the dock, still as the piling besides which it stands
But the features remain obscured by the sun at his back
leans forward as the slender figure grows larger, (to Ethan) Is it him, then
- The tide is too low for the boat to dock, making it necessary for he boat to approach the shore
The slender figure moves off the end of the dock and onto the beach
idles into shadow water but the props start chewing into the sand - the boatman grumbles he can't get any closer
The slender figure has moved to the shoreline and the angle of the light changes - Ambrose is waiting
Nyah hesitates only a flicker of an instant, slips over the side into thigh-high water without taking her eyes off Ambrose
Ambrose strides right on into the bay
as they are just an arm's length apart: takes a deep breath, presses the button to scramble the transponder
(
) The picture abruptly goes dead
Damn
Just when it was about to get interesting
It's okay
She scrambled the transmission
Luther, continue feeding the  her position
Luther punches in
The signal - and the global coordinates are given
They wait
- The satellite positions itself
Can't we speed this up
Luther shoots him a disgusted look
With what
This is the only computer that'll do this
start to bounce back, growing larger and larger on the screen, until:  Nyah can be seen, water up to her thighs, lingering in Ambrose's arms with each blow-up, and linger
And lingering
- right
Now there's a bloke who knows how to deliver a proper welcome
Don't get me wrong, mate
You were quite hospitable
Is it him, then
Ethan's look suggests he's worried about lapse in recruiting judgment
It is, Billy
Then we got'em
We don't know what we've got because we don't know what he's got, where he's got it or what he's doing in Sydney with it
Ethan strides away from the screen, the edge in his voice and the move not altogether lost on either Luther or Billy
-   (
- ) Perfectly poised, still loosely in his arms, Nyah returns Ambrose's penetrating gaze with a pleasant, clear eyed one
Not much luggage
left in a bit of a hurry
'm terribly grateful, Sean
How grateful
Well that depends
On what
How hard you had to work to get me out of there
how in the world did you ever find me
(stopping) How  usually find you, Nyah
How do you that
Magic
Ahh
( ) looking down the length of the dock
Ambrose, his arm around Nyah and carrying her suitcase, moves up the dock toward the house and camera
Stamp steps into the annex and looks over to Wallis, who watches Nyah on the monitors
No flies on her
(checking her on a scanner screen) No bugs either
She's clean
(drily) All cats are
-  -  (  - ) Ethan watches the Nekhorvich video on the computer screen
therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera
Ethan then flips through a series of pictures on the computer depicting the myth of Bellerophon attacking Chimera
Billy moves up behind him
What you got there, mate
myth
just a myth
shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance
Well you know his blokes'll place the in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating
or hard wired
(please) - or hard wired, right
First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house
Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet
Basically impenetrable, 'd say
Ethan, here's Nekhorvich, and here's his boss Luther scans an entry from the  database with newspaper clippings, sidebars of still of McCloy and Nekhorvich
(cont'd) McCloy, Jon Chaddick,  Biocyte Pharmaceuticals
September 30, 1952, Manchester, England
(a little lost) Well do you disagree with that
Not at all
But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it
Billy leaves

As Luther transfer info to Ethan's computer: (cont'd) Ethan, have a look at this
On Ethan's screen appears the Biocyte website; where among he various icons one offer McCloy's proud detailing of Biocyte's philanthropic efforts: ' We at out state-of-the-art solar powered Biocyte building recognized that eternal vigilance is the price of health

Ambrose opens a door
It's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed
Your room
(yes) Mmmm
And my room
long moment
Ambrose walks to a mirrored wall
The mirrors are sliding doors
With a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes
Thought you could use a little something to wear
Nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe
Ambrose pulls out a slinky Armani and drapes it on the bed
( cont'd) Try it on
Nyah hesitates
(cont'd) Go ahead
'm dying to see if remembered your size
Nyah picks it up
No changing room
Ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits
Her blouse, belt, skirt, fall on the bed
As her slender arm reaches down to pick up the Armani: grips her wrist, the flimsy Armani dangling in the air
- meeting Ambrose's look
You're not interested in seeing how it looks
Oh,  am
Later
The Armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor
-  () standing off to one side, listening to Nekhorvich's voice
therefore in a search for our hero, Bellerophon, we created a monster, Chimera
Why's Nekhorvich going on about an old Greek myth
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining molecules
In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world
think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon
That simple, huh
Why not
-  (
- ) lying back on a pillow, looking and off into space to right off camera
She hears Ambrose's voice, with Ethan's voice ' /' Damn, you're beautiful
Nyah reacts as if she'd been rapped on the nose, her eyes moist
She turns abruptly to camera
Did you say something
leaning on an elbow, looking down
said you're beautiful, Nyah
Only because
it's spring
chalk it up (looking him dead in the eye) - to spring fever
Ambrose, amused, lights a cigarette and inhaling: Won't do, love
It's not spring
It's nearly autumn
You're in Oz
everything's upside down and backwards here
(more direct) Maybe that's it, then
Everything's upside down and backwards
-  (   - ) Luther
get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims
Right
guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer
Luther resumes working on his computer and sees Ethan is locked on Ambrose's compound on his computer screen, thinking of Nyah
(cont'd) She did it, Ethan
Nyah's in the compound
Yeah
've just rolled up a snowball and tosses it into hell
Ethan stands
brooding Ethan exits the sheep farm safehouse under a setting sun
' Now we'll see what chance it has
Ethan stops, looking out over the broken plain
His voice is heard overlapping into the next scene
'  (cont'd) (softly) Damn, You're beautiful

She stares out into the night, a gaze that in its bemused intensity is an exact match to Ethan's

-  ) its front page, except for the headlines and date, covered with stacks of paper money, banded bundled dollars piled high as a cord of wood
The amount $24 millions is written in ink over the money
Twenty-four mil
Ambrose's hands shift to another photo of another newspaper, the , this one piled high with English pounds and the written amount: 37 million pounds
' Thirty-seven million pounds
That's a promising bid
The third photo is of the  , with $14 million packaged on it
Ambrose, wearing a robe and seated at a glass-topped table, sets this last photo on the table on top the others
He picks up Nekhorvich's digital camera, removes the film disk, and snaps it into its plastic case
He places the case into an envelope (: The same envelope seen at the track) and hands it to Stamp
We'll need this at the track
Well then
Sorted
Stamp is seated near him
Glances toward Ambrose's bedroom and Nyah asleep in Ambrose's bed
(pointedly) Not everything
Why do you think she's really here
From her point of view or mine
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago
The question is, do you trust her
As he speaks, Ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his robe
Takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the cigar; the razor-sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar like a guillotine
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down
Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate
Ambrose opens the cutter again to clean off the fragments of tobacco trapped by the cut
Tell me, Hugh
You don't exactly hang on Nyah's every word and gesture, do you
Fairly ratty nail, that
Sean touches the nail of Stamp's left pinkie finger
Stamp reacts by slightly withdrawing his hand
Sean
With his left hand Ambrose grabs Stamp's left wrist
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you
Sean, please
Sean pulls Stamp's hand closer
Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse sent in by  to spy in us, why should deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two
Or don't you think  can learn more from her than she can from me
Ambrose twists Stamp's wrist so that Stamp drops to one knee trying to alleviate the pain
(in pain) do
Ambrose leans in close to Stamp's face as he places the cutter around Stamp's pinkie
Now Hugh, you must realize that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with
and my dear chap
may or may not know why she thinks she's here, but 'm willing to take the risk, because Hugh,  am gaging for it
Ambrose closes the cutter on Stamp's finger and cuts the nail, just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood
Stamp cries out
Ambrose tosses Stamp a napkin, light his cigar and exhale
(cont'd) Don't ever question my judgment again

How's it going
Everything okay
Just like old times
Just like old times

Tell me who you've run into at Ambrose's
'  ( ) moving from Nyah to the champagne bar just behind where Ambrose is seen greeting someone in the crowd and they sit at a corner table in front of the window overlooking the track
(a breath, then:) Near as  can tell, there's at least a half-dozen other blokes about the place
Maybe more
Hugh Stamp, an old mate of Sean's, is the only one  recognize, bit of a creep and then some
Stamp, stands a pillar, his finger bandages, looking glum and looking down at Nyah
We know him
He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me
Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house
Have you met them
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door
(looking into Champagne Bar) 've no doubt
' of Ambrose sitting with someone whose face is obscured from his angle by bar patrons
is also looking
and from his point of view it can be seen that Ambrose is talking with John McCloy, the head Biocyte
Ambrose takes an envelope out of his inner left jacket pocket and from it pulls out a small plastic container marked '
' (Identical to the object first seen in Nekhorvich's satchel at airport security
)  He opens it and removes a small shiny object about the size of a quarter
He turns to the window and gestures
Stamp enters the bar
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar
Big bloke, ginger hair
They're into something
' 'll be damned
It's McCloy, the Biocyte Nekhorvich's boss
Yep
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times
What's that about
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money -- -  - is monitoring both cameras
All see Ambrose give the little wafer-like object to Stamp who places it in a small camera, hands it back to Ambrose and exits, waiting just outside the glass door
Ambrose hands the camera to McCloy who looks puzzled
Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how to use a digital camera
McCloy puts it to his eye, fumbles, then with Ambrose's direction: Whatever McCloy's looking at, he's not happy about
McCloy puts the camera down
The two men have words
McCloy shakily leave the table
Ambrose opens the camera
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket

There's an enveloped inside -- -- his left jacket pocket

Nyah, are you up to this

Nyah rises
See anything you like
Yeah
Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and  haven't a sou
While Ambrose is still juggling the drinks, Nyah reaches into his trouser pockets, and rummages around
(laughing) Nyah
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed
No worries, mate
She pulls out a fifty-dollar note
Would you mind terribly
(cont'd) (amused and turned on) - not at all
But you'll pay for that and with interest
've no doubt
She heads up the stairs
(reaching into his pocket for money) Hold on
Ambrose grabs her arm, and she almost drops the envelope she's just lifted
(: It is important not to see her actually lift it)
She's holding it, pinned between her right arm and side
As it's slipping, she notes Stamp above her, looking down and has to conceal what she's holding from him as well: (cont'd) Put down a couple of hundred for

She takes it and as she does the envelope falls, but she manages to catch it with her left hand, blocking the move with her body as she does

passes Stamp, not seeing him standing just a row above, blocked from her by one of the pillars
Stamp idly regards her and then decides: he follows
perspiring, approaches the betting table thru the last of the parked cars
approaches the door thru which Nyah had gone and starts to open it - only to have the door slammed in his face and on his bandaged finger by Billy, in a track usher's uniforms
(very solicitous) Sorry about that, mate, that must've really - aggrhh
Even as Stamp winces in pain his arm has shot out and Billy finds himself pinned to the wall gasping for air
If he'd been welded there by a band of steal he'd have more room to maneuver
Say again
Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh

She gives him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off - no more bets

She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it, tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her

He walks to a desk and brings up a computer the Biocyte website and McCloy infomercial
Stamp notes that Ambrose is on the computer and moves to the desk
thought you were going to dinner
(pulling up something on the computer) Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card
Where is it
In the envelope in my pocket
My right
jacket
pocket
Stamp leans over and pulls out the envelope
As he does he sees Ambrose has pulled up and started to play McCloy's informercial
(cont'd) (calmly) We've got an opportunity here
'm not going to miss it
(
-  & ) a microscopic view of myriads of ugly green spiky objects amid exploding red ones
Chimera attacking human blood
One more shot
lavender stained group of spiky objects amid exploding the green ones
(cont'd) Bellerophon attacking Chimera
On an adjacent screen is a frozen frame of McCloy looking thru the digital camera at the racetrack
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place
Why would he do it
don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic
Get me a twenty on Nyah
She must still be on the property
told her to get outta there
-  () McCloy gets in the rear of the limo and lights up a cigar
The limo takes off
another car pulls out and tags along behind the limo
-   () Michael at the wheel
-  -  () McCloy doesn't like the taste of the cigar, goes to toss it out but the electronic window button doesn't work
He notices the evening paper partially open on the seat
His name leaps out
He opens the paper announce that John
McCloy,  of Biocyte, Inc
, one of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies, has died of a straight and terrible strain of influenza Shocked, McCloy drops the paper, calling out: George
George
George
The drover doesn't turn around
McCloy can't believe it
He bangs on chauffeur window
The driver turns on the air conditioning in the rear of the limo
McCloy clutches his throat and passes out
(
- ) regains consciousness
He's got tubes coming out of every orifice and is contained in the equivalent of a plastic bubble
Drenched in perspiration and he looks around for a call button
He grips the side of the bed
Bloody room
just
shut your eyes, shut your eyes
He can't resist
Opens them to look up thru the plastic to see: a shimmering blur coming in and out of focus
(cont'd) 'll be buggered
What's this then
visit from an old friend
What's happening here
You're dead
Fatigued, certainly
But dead is a little extreme
On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live
(confused) It was in the bloody papers, on the telly
what's this about Gradski
You are infected with Chimera, my friend

International, please
'd like to make a reservation on the next available flight tonight
Where to
Where is next available flight going
The operator answers
Fine

She hangs up, goes to the door
The house is eerily silent

- Moves softly downstairs & hesitates at bottom, glancing about
Ulrich
Ulrich
Silence
she goes into the kitchen
No one
She goes out the door
'  -  (
- ) running pell-mell down to the shore
Stops
Looks outside the small skiff moored at the end of the dock
It's dark and she decides to chance it
She moves onto the pier, trying to glide by the boathouse
figure darts out and grabs her
She tries to scream but can't
The figure whips her around and she sees: Easy, easy, easy, shhh
Oh Ethan
She throws her arms around him
Are you okay
am now
Get me out of here
Just get me out of here
It's going to be okay
He holds her
- McCloy's strapped down, but manages to reach the call button and push it
Again and again
No use, my friend
The medical staff wants no part of this
Doctors don't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else
McCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment
How could possibly be infected
Nekhorvich shrugs
That's exactly what Gradski said - 27 hours before he died
With Chimera, the most minute exposure can be fatal
McCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor
He grips the edge of the hospital bed
But then you shouldn't be feeling to ill
not for another three of four hours anyway
McCloy breaks a fresh sweat in a sudden spasm of anxiety
You have Bellerophon
(mildly) Do
You took it
All of it
And what if  need it
(amused) 'If
'  My, my, my
the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with Chimera needed it as well
Oh, please
How was  to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours
By asking me
You still don't get it, do you
You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - needed to know just how bad the disease was - in the real world, not the lab
And you never know til you try
You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas
But  saw you creating a disease so terrible in Chimera that the cure would be priceless
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure
Well, the thought had occurred to me
needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon
For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster
Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it
Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo
Not anymore
have you any idea the & money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium
If  couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there can make on
there it is
've confessed
, John
McCloy, am in business to make money
Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs
Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do  have to screw to get a a break
now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work
You know,  think it's a little late for that
Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him
-  ( ' ) Nekhorvich heaves a sigh and rips off a latex mask, and the vocal oscillator, revealing an exhausted Ethan
Angle widens to include Luther and Billy in hospital greens
Luther and Billy nod in disgusted assent
-  () holds tight in her embrace with Ethan
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when 'm with him
the thought of never seeing you
how are we getting out of here
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose
What
You told me to get out of here thought you were here to collect me was so relieved
(with growing urgency) No time to explain
You've done well, and we're so close
So close
It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks
Don't worry - it'll be over soon
That's a promise
Come on, now off you go
He gives her an affectionate smile and she reluctantly heads back to the house, her expression troubled, even suspicious
-  ( ' ) Having just taken off the mask, Ethan stands with Luther and Billy
(disgusted by what he's heard) So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus
Yeah
Why else would he come back to Australia
If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere
kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease
You've got the voice print, 'll get us in
-   () Ethan enters and tears off his mask, revealing Ambrose filled with implacable rage
He looks up to see Stamp who's been obviously waiting for him
Tearing the voice oscillator
Leaning with both hands on a counter-surveillance monitor table he stares at the floor, his face rictus of hateful intensity
You were right
Hunt stung McCloy tonight
He knows
They'll be going into Biocyte
Ambrose looks up slowly to Stamp who's been standing by
Good
then we go where he'll be, don't we
Well done, Hugh
Well done
'  (

wakes with a start
The window's lowered -- Billy's in livery
You're home, guv'ner
Home
It's taking time to register
Then: - where's George
My regular driver
Where is he
Took ill, guv'
Touch of the flu
They say it's going around
Nasty business
Mind you don't catch a chill now
Still dazed, McCloy manages to nod and exit the limo
Billy drives off
-   - (
) including all specifications
Luther, do you have the building up and running
Luther punches in and up comes a squat little island a hundred yards off shore, connected to the mainland by a wooden bridge
(cont'd) That's not exactly it
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure
Nyah still on the property
She hasn't left it
Then: Okay, here you go - As Luther speaks, the building - on his computer graphics, one with the     , is being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the rendering specifications by Luther, as if the building itself were being constructed at a madly rapid pace, from its foundation to its reinforced steel structure, to its honeycombing of floors, to its outer skin
Luther's reconstitution of the building lot static, but moving around and above it even as he proceeds
Let's start from the inside out
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building
Only about eight personnel -- chemists in lab coats, workers in bio-containment suits, etc
-- populate the lab, passing through security door and air locks, monitoring the virus stock, pading the injection gun, etc
' Chimera itself is kept in two places: in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small airtight chamber - inside three injection guns
' Mate, you kill it in both places, we're laughin' and we go home
Now how to get in there
No garage entrance
Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol
Ethan watches the rendition of the Biocyte lobby on screen -  () in overhead light, his eyes are dark pits, somehow underlying her saturnine intensity: If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception
For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security
Not going in from the ground
Show me the atrium
- The height and extent of the atrium are revealed, as well as its conclusion in a glass floor in the ceiling of the lab
' (unhappily) The atrium
One of a kind
Runs down the center of the building
Provides 24-hour natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells
Optimal growing conditions for the virus
Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab's ceiling
Luther sees the glint growing in Ethan's eye
Hey, atrium roof closes at sundown
- As the sun sets, the louvers of the atrium roof begin closing
' And if the louvers are open for more than thirty seconds at night, the Civil Emergency alarms are tipped
Those even can't stop
Thirty seconds total to get you in and the cable out
Security
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop
'm not waiting 48 hours
When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, 'm going in and getting her out
-  () No, Hunt will prefer to engage in some sort of acrobatic insanity to enter Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where security is minimal
Suddenly there's the roar of helicopter rotors

Ethan streaks thru the beams of light toward the atrium floor
-   - reaches the end of the cord, slows himself to a stop and sees the security guard through the window
The guard starts as he catches a glimpse of Ethan's reflection in the control panels
Luther, 'm looking at security
- (utterly shocked) Oh
Uh
Commencing diversion
(sotto voce, typing swiftly) Alarm in cosmetics
- Ethan swings himself up to the ledge above the guard's window, putting himself out of the puzzled guard's sight
' Gotta get that cable out
Ethan unhooks the cord and flips to the atrium floor
An alarm goes off
'  (cont'd) There it goes
Still confused and concerned, the guard doesn't immediately react to the alarm or the ringing phone
He finally answers the phone
#2' (on phone) what's the matter with you
Can't you hear the alarm's gone off in cosmetics
The first guard gives up what's confused him
(sarcastic) Right
Then  guess 'll have to trot off to see who's pinching eyeliner, won't
(exits, grumbling) 'll even check the stairwell on the way

Reading package and Cable is clean
(exhaling, relieved) He's on his way
Staring at the buildings control panels

) hugs the floor just out of sight of the befuddled security guard
' He'll make the attempt at the only possible time for both of us, 11
- when the guards rotate and the buildings air-filtration generators go active, covering the sound of his break-in
Ethan, the generators are about to go active
We'll be out of contact for eleven minutes
- dark and silent
turn over and roar to life
cuts into the glass floor, pops it out, and drops thru the opening
None of it's heard under the generators
Ethan drops onto the lab floor and heads across the lab and up the ramp to the hot zone
' The frequency of the generators operate to our advantage - cutting radio communication from his team for the next eleven minutes
-   () Stamp, flanked by several of his team in Biocyte security guard uniform, crosses the lobby toward a pair of actual Biocyte security guards who appear more puzzled than alarmed at this unexpected influx
What's this, then
Reinforcements
Not exactly, mate
(
- ) His attention in drawn to a spot on the grid where Nyah's transponder blip, a circular yellow one in contrast to Ethan's, is moving
Troubled: Billy
think we got a problem
Nyah's on the wing
Up early
Billy, do you copy
- Exactly where is she
in the building
' Say again
Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building
' am
She is
' Ethan does it the hard way to avoid confrontation
Neutralizing security guards is simply too distasteful to him
- The two guards who had greeted Stamp and his arriving team lie inert on the lobby floor
' 've never found that a problem
(
- ) Billy's so surprised he momentarily gets loose with the copter and it banks off
As it and he recover: Right
Well, then
She's not likely to be alone
is she
' The question Is 'how many of 'em
' can't get thru to Ethan
Not 'til the generators go off
When's that
' Not for another eight and a half minutes
staring at the red and yellow blips in vertical alignment, the Yellow one, Nyah, considerably below the red one, Ethan
-    () The door reads

Ethan pulls on a protective mask from his pack and puts a miniaturized recorder up to the voice print activator: ' John
McCloy
Ethan's buzzed into the hot zone
He steps into the air locks
- small bomb is placed by the dark gloves of someone unseen
-   - a shadow falls across the dirt in front of the bumper
with a digital clock face, its red  illuminating descending numbers, is carefully placed inside the bumper
The magnet on it doesn't quite catch
It's then placed more carefully
- Luther doesn't pick up on the faint metallic sound just outside
He's concentrating on the flashes on the screen showing the transponder rising in the building
Increasingly desperate: It looks like Nyah's headed toward an elevator
working meticulously an a computer monitor
- and a security guard's body lying in the corridor
pair of trousered legs step over the body and into the elevator joining Nyah's legs and feet, and other pairs of trousered legs
The elevator doors close
' If Hunt actually manages to squeak thru the atrium he's liable to make it to Chimera before we will
On his computer screen the yellow dot continues its ascent, the two dots growing ever closer
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan
' How much longer before you can reach him
Five and a half minutes
(looking at his chronometer) He's breached the hot zone
' On the other hand we know where Hunt will be and he doesn't know we're coming
- In front of each of three large television monitors is a vial shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two liters in size
Each one is contained behind Plexiglas and each one pale yellow, one sunset red
Behind them are monitors marked, respectively:    ,   , Behind these is a monitor screen with a blow-up of the contents of the vials & the magnitude of the blow-up - 950,000x
These are -Ray microscope blow-ups, i

Ethan's on the computer controls, racing thru to , which calls for optimal levels of 6
9 pH and 11 degrees Celsius
He drops the pH to zero and punches up the temperature to a hundred
The effect on the greenish hue in the bottle is subtle but immediate - not so subtle is the effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically - they immediately appear agitated, their microscopic  innards contracting and expanding
Ethan moves on to the Master Seed Stock and the In Vitro Virus panels on the computer
The changes he makes are reflected on the digital monitoring panels before each viral container
vial has begun to change colors from sea green to a paler pea- green
The liquid itself begins to thicken: (female) Alert

- Ethan places a little plastique on a timer and runs up a ramp to the decontaminant air lock at the back entrance to the hot zone
' How're we doin', then
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area
Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab
' What can we do' mate
(staring at them) Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one
- ' The read and yellow blips are now on the same plane
The yellow dot moves toward the red one as if drawn by a slow motion magnet

- heads up a ramp to the three injection guns
Hands in gloves he reaches into the chamber for one of the injection guns
' He's still got three injection guns in the test lab
They're loaded with doses of Chimera which he'll destroy by firing into a hyper-thermal chamber
He places the barrel of the gun, seals the chamber, and fires
There's a tiny flash of light
Ethan withdraws the gun
- Luther's sweating it as the clock counts down:  :30, :29, :28
- twenty-seven, twenty-six, twenty-five, come on, Ethan we're almost there
-'m off sensitive for this
In a spasm of anxiety Luther bolts to his feet, wipes his brow
(cont'd) - eighteen seconds, the generators'll be off and Ethan's back on line
Luther glances thru the van window only to see reflected in the van side mirror: -   (
) reflected in it is the face of a digital clock, its red illuminating the clock's numbers fourteen - thirteen - twelve - (realizing what he's in for) Oh - oh - oh - Even as he moans he's frantically ripping out the computer and cords dangling, hotfoots toward the van exit
-   - Ethan fires the second injection gun
Picks up the third and last
He pauses as he's about to fire it, staring intently suddenly the gun is held by: who turns the barrel from the hyper-thermal chamber and releases into his wrist
- whose vision of of Nekhorvich fades
Still thinking of Nekhorvich he continues to stare at the gun for another moment and before he can fire: - The bomb's  readout shows 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
As it reaches 0 a small light on the bomb suddenly stops its incessant blinking
- explodes
Saw horses and dirt fly
-    - looks up just in time to see Ambrose and team arrive at the far end of the lab
They immediately open fire, shattering the room's walls and the glass injection gun chamber
As the injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below, one of Ambrose's team runs to grab it, but before he can reach it he is shot by Ethan, who's falling to the floor below
(to Ulrich) Get it
As Ethan hits and dives for cover, Ulrich goes for the gun Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg
Ulrich hops back in pain
Those were two explosions, your van and your safehouse, in case you didn't hear them both --  believe that means you've also lost a friend
Ethan's crouching on the ground protected behind a series of vertical metal sheets
And you couldn't walk to tell me about it
Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the shattered glass on the floor
Ambrose, Wallis, and a couple of other Ambrose team members fire, kicking up broken glass
Ethan backs off
(yelling) Hold your fire, dammit
The two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot zone
(cont'd) Well, Hunt
How've you been
(smiling) Fight a bit of a cold
And you're happy about that
Beats fighting the flu, 'm here to tell you
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you
Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes
would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint
Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off
You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was
knew where it was
Oh
then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective
You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for
Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen round clip into his weapon and he punctuates this last with a spray of gunfire, attempting to cover his own effort to the reach the injection gun
The return fire nearly hits the injection gun, kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the floor
Stop
Put a sock in it
Hit that bloody gun and you'll spray the bloody virus all over the place
Everybody's regained cover but the injection gun remains out of everybody's reach
There it is, guys, the last of it
Yep
You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer
What was the top bid
Why, you going to make me a better offer
Than thirty-seven million pounds
Not really
(not amused) Somebody's been slipping you our mail
Come on out here, you bad girl
Nyah walks out into view on her own
Ethan sees her reflection in the mirror
Enraged, but trying to control it
She doesn't belong here, Sean
Let her go
She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt
from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me
Ball's in your court, Hunt
What've you got to say
Nyah's waiting for your answer
pregnant pause
' (breaking through the static) Ethan, Nyah's in the building
Do you copy
(
) a mess amid the rubble of the construction van
(dryly) Thank you
(cont'd) Sure he won't shoot you the minute he's got it
Oh, Hunt, please
One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions
In other words, you're calling her a flake
- listening
You know women, mate
Like monkeys, they are
Won't let go of one branch til they've got a grip on the next
get it, Nyah
'll cover you
Ambrose cocks his weapon
(cont'd) 'm waiting
(not much more than body length from Ethan) This isn't exactly working out the way you thought it would, Ethan
Sorry
Finger on the injection trigger, she rises and turns the barrel on her arm, firing
The sound of the air pressure pushing the virus into her is unmistakable, as is the circle of tiny puncture wounds on her skin
Nyah moves in front of Ethan, covering him, as she turns to face Ambrose
shocked by Nyah's gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he resets the 'Countdown' on his chronometer to twenty hours
As it drops into the nineteen: (frustrated in the extreme) You
bitch
She's been laughing away with Ethan: You're not going to shoot, Sean
Not this bitch
She's worth thirty-seven million pounds
- ' fingers press a red button on a tiny detonator
There's a bright heat flash from the hot zone and an explosion of gas and water -- the plastique killing any airborne virus
Ethan uses the diversion to grab Nyah and run with her to the far side of the lab, behind a stock of horizontal cylinders
- Ambrose and team recover from the explosion and begin firing on the tanks protecting Ethan and Nyah, surrounding the two with fire and jets of released steam
-  - behind the stack of tanks
Ethan launches an explosive down a short hallway, blowing a hole in the building's exterior wall
- group of Biocyte security guards enter from behind Ambrose and team and catch them off-guard
All hell breaks loose
-  - (outraged) What did you think you were doing
wasn't thinking
Just
trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all
This hits Ethan with the force of a blow
- you who don't have a conscience
(something of surprise to her) guess  lied
You can't get both of us out of here, can you
No
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late
Before  start killing people
No
'm infected with Chimera
You know you don't have a choice
Just do it now
She puts Ethan's gun to her forehead
(cont'd) For god's sake, get it over with
pulls back
- He can't fire, lower the hammer
We've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before you start killing anybody
'll get Bellerophon into your system by then
Just stay alive
'm not gonna lose you
Ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambrose's team, wounding a couple men
He reaches the wall and dives thru, camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in the air all around him
Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it
-  (
) of Aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids shortly before sleep
the haunting notes of didgeridoo insure they're not being overheard
(reading the paintings titles) 'Dreaming of Birds and Flying Fox,' 'Bushfire Dreaming,'  'Wind Dreaming,' -- oddly appropriate - Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle weary Ethan: (cont'd) - since it appears that Chimera, the mother of all nightmares is on the loose somewhere around here - is there any way this disaster can be viewed as a qualified one
(tight-lipped) Not yet
We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable
No deposits, no withdrawals
Therefore no suspects
We think we've got our finger on the buyer
Do you
Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem
You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte
If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market
Yes,  believe that's right
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera
You mean that leaves Miss Hall
Yes,  believe that's right
Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious
Highly infectious
Ethan glances at his chronometer
Swanbeck sees it
(') You noted the time of exposure
Ethan nods
(') - good
Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got - (glancing at the chronometer) - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth
She sacrificed herself
Brave girl
If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice
But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her
After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law
And Hunt
However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera
Bring it back alive
Ethan's staring at Swanbeck
(') Something else
Aren't you even curious
About why she did it
No
can't afford to be curious
And neither can you, Hunt
As the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and intensity, the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems particularly oppressive
Ethan's up against it and he knows it
from harbors to skyline in all its sunlight splendor
Nyah sits for a moment, looking steadily at Ambrose
Ambrose pats the cannister he's carrying
Feel like pleading for your life
(with an edge) Not as much as you feel like hearing it
Ambrose slaps her
With scarcely a flicker of hesitation she slaps him back
God damn it, Nyah
Why did you do it
Why did you save that bastard
If it'll make you feel any better  won't do it again
It doesn't
Full of pain and rage, he gets out of the car
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money
What are you talking about
In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz
'day
nameless guard from Michael's car idling nearby gets into the back seat with Nyah
Ambrose shuts the car door in Nyah's face, gets in Michael's car takes off
/ -   - Luther
Luther
Luther drops a tiny part into his computer board and, as he tries to fish it out with the aid of a magnifying glass: Ethan,  keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til  access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til  get this thing booted up and running
How much time does she have left
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds
Before we kill her or cure her
Right
Wrong
All we've got to worry about is Ambrose
Nyah will take care of Nyah
What are you talking about
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself
So, first things, first
Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts

' Confirms what Ambrose is gonna do - -  - Barrels of toxic materials line the walls, as an armed guard patrols the corridor, leading into the main chamber, where we follow McCloy into - McCloy enters and begins pacing

-      () speed along an isolated road in close formation before turning onto a side road, revealed as leading to a bridge across a small strip of water to a small island
-   -   () As the cycles and vehicles cross the bridge and approach the front gate, the camera swings around the side of the island establishing the geography and the six cannon emplacements before coming to a stop on -   -   - scaling the seaward side of the island with minimal gear / -   - resting like a giant locust, half hidden by a cluster of trees on the bluff overlooking Bear Island
Billy's at the controls, with binoculars, maintaining surveillance of the island and environs
In the back, Luther is at Work on his  computer
' Ethan's out from under the bridge and on the south-east face
- / Ethan climbs the side of the cliff
' Ethan, Ambrose and his tem have over the bridge - Copy that
Ethan reaches the clifftop and sees armed guards patrolling
' You all right, mate
From here it looks like very security
What's it look like like from there
Risky
He's over the top and moves swiftly to cover
Ethan surprises and kills a perimeter guard, then runs to a length of grating and lifts one of the panels
Ethan climbs down through the grating in the roof of the tunnel
Using a bar to swing down, he breaks a second guard's neck and drops to the floor
-   -  () Ambrose and team drive through the entry gate -- passing its sign and various no-nonsense warnings of 'No Trespassing,' etc
-- before Biocyte security guards close it behind them
-  - Breached the structure at the ten o'clock grating
In the tunnel moving toward the target
Ethan begins heading down the tunnel
- Ambrose and team enter, where McCloy and his  and are waiting
As Stamp stands back, observing, and Wallis sets up a laptop, Ambrose walks up to a refectory-like table and stands opposite McCloy
Ambrose reaches into his coat and puts two cannisters on the table in front of McCloy
McCloy's chemist picks up the cannisters and inserts them into two chambers connected to his microscope
It's a  match
The blood's loaded with Chimera
An insert of the microscope plate shows the two samples, as Bellerophen destroys Chimera
The chemist presses a button on the chamber and there's a heat flash
The chamber red light moves to green, and there's a mechanical voice: 'Substance destroyed
' (cont'd) And they certainly have Bellerophen
The Kev cannister is out on the table
Well, then
You've got both the virus and the anti-virus, Chimera and Bellerophen
Which means 've thirty million for you Ambrose doesn't respond
(cont'd) That's all the cash  can come up with Not exactly
Wallis
(off Biocyte figures on laptop) More like two-two point two million
In any case we don't want your cash
Then what do you want
Ambrose picks up a mobile phone and dials
Stock, Mr
McCloy
Stock options, to be a little more precise
(into the phone) - cut her loose
right in the center of town
the more crowded the better
(punching off, to McCloy) How quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus
-  - As he moves along the tunnel, Ethan suddenly flattens himself against a wall as he receives a transmission from Luther
' Ethan, just picked up an Ambrose call - Nyah's been dropped off
think she's alive
Where is she
-  - Somewhere in Sydney
-  - Ethan hears something and ducks into a nearby cavity in the tunnel wall
As a guard approaches, Ethan steps out of the cavity and knocks the guard out, then throws him into the opposite wall
' Ethan
Do you copy
' 'Somewhere in Sydney
'  Care to harden the target
' Can't
Until  can get the  up on our computer
it's still down
The clock is ticking
Back to the matter at hand, Ethan completes the move on the guard and knocks him out
- Bellerophen
No time at all once 've got it
Good
Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof
(alarmed) What are you talking about
An outbreak of Chimera
Where
In downtown Sydney for a start
McCloy is stunned
(cont'd) You create the supply, Mr
McCloy, we've just created the demand
Three million people in Sydney and 17 million people in Australia are going to need Bellerophen within a matter of days
not to mention the rest of the world
-  -   - ' stealthily approach a couple dozen jittery pigeons, cooing and pecking
The intensity of their noise-making increases as Ethan reaches them
-  - Hearing the disruption of the pigeons, one of Ambrose's guards leaves his post at the double doors and head the tunnel toward the birds to investigate
-  - Ambrose's guard draws his gun and continues approaching the pigeons
Before the guard can see him, Ethan runs forward, and sends the pigeons into scattered flight, blinding the guard
Ethan jumps into a back flip and double kicks -- first knocking away the guard's gun and then knocking him out and flat on his back
Ethan continues his flip and lands right back on his feet
- -- now here's the way it's going to work
Wallis, the shares outstanding are
Ninety-three point four million
Which means, Mr
McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options
We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options
Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share
We'll agree to buy at fifty
(cont'd) When your stock goes north of two hundred, and it will, those options will be worth billions
We can borrow whatever we need to buy the 48,000,000 shares, fifty-one percent of Biocyte
Outrageous
won't let you take control of my company
Sit down
You'll be a billionaire
Better than being broke
've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line
Ball's in your court, Mr
McCloy
-  - Ethan pulls a can of explosive material form his pack
He rolls it towards the double doors, and it stops just before reaching them
Then, pointing his gun to the ceiling, he fires into the air
-   - hears a noise and looks to Stamp, who heard it as well
Stamp nods to two guards to check it out
They head across the room to the double doors
-  -      - waits for the right moment before raising his and firing at the can of explosives
Just as it ignites, the guards open the doors and are blown back by force of the explosion
-   - reacts and turns toward the explosion
Amidst the flames and debris, a single white dove comes flying into the room
And beyond it, Ambrose can see Ethan Hunt in silhouette walking slowly past the doorway
Run that bastard down
Orders are shouted, and guards, along with Stamp, hotfoot it down the tunnel-corridor in the direction of the explosion
-  - run down the tunnel
The guards move commando-style, directed by Stamp's hand signals
-  - Ambrose loads his gun and drags the tip of the barrel along the table
We're running short on time, Mr
McCloy
We've got to conclude our business
McCloy pauses only a moment before nodding to his accountant
Yes, start the transfer
The accountant begins working on his laptop
(to Wallis) Follow it
Let me know
-  - pass a couple of doorways
pigeon flies past Stamp's face and he stops
As he turn, Ethan Lowers himself from a hiding place in the ceiling
Stamp and Ethan pull their guns on one another
They're in a face-off until they both agree to drop their guns, but Stamp catches his in mid-air and points it back at Ethan
You broke our deal
You're too trusting
Raise your hands slowly
As Ethan raises his hands, he pulls the pin on a grenade and then kicks it between Stamp's legs
The handle flies off:  It's live
When Stamp looks down in surprise at the grenade, Ethan kicks out his gun
Trying to escape the grenade, Stamp smashes into Ethan and seems to have hit him in the jaw
Both hit the ground as the grenade explodes, with Stamp appearing to have the upper hand
- As everyone waits for the transfer to complete, the grenade explodes out in the tunnel
McCloy and his accountant freeze with alarm as a sprinkling of dust settles on the room
(to the accountant) Keep it going
' Sean, this rat's reached the end of the maze
(into walkie-talkie) Is he alive
' More or less
Bring him to me
-  - Luther has the  computer starting to access the satellite
(nervously) We're due to take off
Not for seven more minutes
-  - checking his computer screen, which shows the transfer has finished successfully
Sean
Transfer complete
Stamp drags Ethan in, arms pinned with heavy tape
Stamp Ethan look grimy as sandbags after a busy day of tunneling
Ambrose rises to examine his prize
(apprehensive) What exactly do you intend to do with him
Ambrose walks behind Ethan and kicks his knees out from under him
Ethan falls to the floor
-  - Ethan
Ethan
Do you copy
Luther hears nothing in response but while noise
He looks to Billy and indicates there's no answer
Well, mate, maybe this is one of those times we shouldn't follow orders
-  () the rotor blades turn over
-   () (to Ethan) What have you got to say for yourself
Hunt
Any last words
Ethan appears as if he wants to respond, but can't
Ambrose kicks him again
(cont'd) Stop mumbling
Afraid he's got no choice
believe broke his jaw
Hugh, 'm impressed
Ambrose has picked up a pair of Berettas, and is proceeding to load both full seventeen round clips
(anxiety mounting) What do you intend to do
Ambrose favors McCloy with a glance of genial exacerbation
You needn't watch
-  () rising off the golf green, and banking toward the island
-  () Ambrose standing before Hunt with a pair of fully loaded Berettas
The sound of the helicopter grows
- right
We don't have a lot of time, Hunt
whatever you've got to say, say it now
Ethan indeed makes some considerable effort to speak but can only manage a few guttural, progressively desperate sounds which continue as: (cont'd) Sorry mate,  can't understand a bloody word
How about giving us a big smile to remember you by
(hearing the helicopter) No
Well, then
This is what's known as getting your gun off
With that Ambrose empties thirty four rounds from the two Berettas into Ethan whose body jerks crazily on the floor
McCloy nearly faints, and Ambrose laughs at his squeamishness until something on Ethan's body catches his eye: the top of the little finger on the right hand is bleeding
Ambrose grabs Ethan's face, and rips off a latex mask: revealing Stamp, eyes wide open and thoroughly lifeless
His jaw, under the mask had been taped carefully close with the same heavy tape Ethan has used to mount the drain-pipe shotgun on the tunnel wall
(cont'd) Bloody hell
He looks around, but Stamp is gone
So is the cannister and kevlar vest that had been on the table moments before
- Ethan's on the motorcycle, heading toward the gates, which a pair of security guards are frantically trying to close
Billy and Luther in the copter are over the island, and bank so Luther can fire a grenade launcher and blow the back of Ambrose's boat
The guards close the gate, Ethan runs the motorcycle up the hillock and jumps the gate, over onto the bridge
Ambrose follows in the , crashing thru the gate
They race across the bridge and the road, onto the huge greensward opposite to and similar in shape to Bare Island
There, with the helicopter hovering, Ambrose manages to corner Ethan and after they expend whatever ammunition their weapons hold, they move into each other bare handed and engage in ferocious, no-holds-barred combat, the helicopter hovering low enough to keep away whatever's left of Ambrose's henchmen, the chopper's downdraft hitting them and flattening the grass around them
Ethan prevails
on bluffs overlooking the city
Camera moves slowly to the top of the bluff
/ -   () With Billy flying and Luther at the door, machine gun in hand, the copter nears the Bare Island gun pit and Ethan
-     - runs into the central 'hole' area, guns in both hands and wearing the kevlar vest
He runs toward the walled edge of the enclosure and jumps
As he pulls himself up the top of the wall, he sees the  helicopter approaching
gunman appears from the tunnel entrance and opens fire, the bullets exploding into the wall around Ethan, who jumps out of the way to avoid them
/ - is under fire as well, bullets spraying the windshield, driving Luther back inside and causing Billy to turn the chopper around
Man at your six
-     - who rolls and returns fire at the gunman
Ethan first hits the gunman in the leg, and then shoots and explodes the canisters behind the gunman, killing him
(to Billy) The field of fire is too heavy
Back off and pinpoint their positions
- bearing down on him as he stands up
Ethan just manages to dive out of its path before a second motorcycle comes up over the hill
Ethan flips backwards and fires his pistol, shooting the second cyclist off his bike
The motorcycle flies over Ethan, who runs after it and jumps on, revving the throttle and taking off
-   - deploys some of his men via walkie-talkie while others scramble into their cars
(into walkie-talkie) Hunt's heading for the bridge
Coming in at twelve o'clock high
Gold Falcon with several of Ambrose's men inside enters the bridge from the mainland and speeds toward the island
- Ambrose's men exit the complex and get into their cars
- crests a hill aboard the cycle, the  chopper in b
g
Clear that bridge for me
' Roger that
' They're tracking you on the left, Ethan
Prepare for some fire
Michael's  and Wallis' sedan speed along as a gunman from the fires on Ethan up the hill, spraying bullets around him
- approaches the island
Luther fires his grenade launcher
It hits the Falcon's trunk, lifting its back wheel off the ground, but the Falcon keeps coming, its trunk ablaze
Luther reloads as a gunman leans out the window, firing up at Ethan on the hill
- lays on the cycle's throttle, accelerates down the hill and propels the bike into the air and off the island, just as -   - again fires his grenade launcher, this time at the front of the - on the bridge
The grenade explodes at the front of the car and hurls the Falcon into the air and off the bridge
- / - is in mid-air on the cycle, heading down toward the bridge
Just as he lands, the Gold Falcon flies off the bridge, and Ethan speeds through the flames and off onto the mainland
- Michael's  arrives and tears through the gate and flames, followed by Wallis' sedan and then Ambrose, riding a motorcycle
- races up the road to find a white Falcon approaching
The  chopper arrives and gunfire's exchanged
Luther takes a hit in the shoulder and drops his gun as the chopper banks away
-  - Luther grips his shoulder in pain and falls back into his seat, jarring the  computer
It responds by beeping and coming to life
Nyah's yellow dot pops up on the screen
The target is located
Ethan, the computer's up
've got Nyah
She's moved out of the city
Luther, say again
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs
One klick away
-  - (over increasing static) Copy
She's only got twenty-eight minutes left
Track ahead and pick her up
- Luther bands his shoulder wound and monitors his  laptop
We won't be able to cover you
-  - slightly slows the bike to concentrate over the static
You're breaking up
Track ahead and pick her up
You've got me on
Bring her to me
Ethan pulls out and throws away the earpiece
- Billy, North Head
Haul ass
- Ethan heads downhill as the  approaches on an adjacent road
He pulls out in front of it, immediately drawing fire
Without slowing, Ethan drops to the side his cycle for cover
-   - watches the  laptop as the chopper speeds over Sydney
-  -   ' Wallis' sedan appears from an adjoining road and pulls in behind Ethan, who climbs back aboard his cycle
Cut off, the  turns onto a side road to intercept Ethan
Get him
can't get a good shot
Before an intersection, Ethan both revs and brakes, spinning the bike and creating a smoke screen
Wallis' car enters the smoke
(cont'd) can't see him, mate
Slow down
Shut up
know what 'm doing
Wallis breaks hard, but not hard enough:  he stops just in the path of an oncoming 18-wheeler
His car's demolished
-  - Ethan pulls out of the smoke as the  bursts out of the scrub behind him, striking the rear of the cycle
Ethan puts his bike into a spin and pulls his gun, ending up alongside the passenger window
He fires through the window, shooting both Michael and the bodyguard
The  veers off, crashing into a line of parked cars
It hits the first car and flips up and over, landing upside down on several more parked cars
Ethan speeds off on his smoking cycle
Ambrose arrives and then takes a side road
-   - working on his  laptop
The range -- ie, the distance from the moving copter to the yellow dot, Nyah, on the edge of the screen -- is reduced to about two kilometers
(to Billy) Range is two kay
hope there's a place to land
Luther looks up from the screen to see the bluff of North Head at the entrance to Sydney's harbor
- -  - tearing down the road, when suddenly from a side trail Ambrose pulls out behind him and begins firing
Ethan weaves to avoid Ambrose's fire and passes a car, pulling in front of it for cover
The car skids, forcing Ambrose to veer around it
() rapidly approaching the North Head bluff
There she is
got visual
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds
- moving up behind Nyah who is walking purposefully to the edge of the bluff and a precipitous drop to rocks and surf a hundred and fifty feet below
Camera drops to Nyah's shoulder level and moves with her to the bluff's edge
As she's just a few steps away from stepping off, there's a roar and the helicopter rises into the shot, before her wild-eyed Billy gesturing, 'Stop
Stop
' to Nyah
- Ethan passes narrowly between a car and oncoming truck
Ambrose follows as soon as the truck clears
Ethan fires backward using his side-view mirror to aim, exploding Ambrose's windscreen
Ambrose skids until his wheel clips a rock, knocking him upright
Ethan turns into a side road and speeds through open scrub
Back on the main road, Ambrose roars off to intercept Ethan
-  - On a clifftop clearing, Ethan races along as Ambrose moves to cut him off
They head toward one another
' Ethan, we've got her
Tracking to you now
We're reading 5 minutes 19 seconds
-  - Ethan and Ambrose round a bend and face one another
Without hesitating, they charge towards each other
As they near one another, each leaps forward and off his bike, and they collide hard in mid-air
They fall to the ground fighting as their bikes skid and Ethan's explodes, raining debris upon them
Ethan and Ambrose rush towards one another
Ethan flips Ambrose to the ground
Ambrose pulls a gun from his ankle holster
As Ethan knocks it away, he loses his own gun and they both fall off a 30-foot cliff
- at top speed over Sydney
Nyah appears weak and shivers
(to Billy) Bearing two one zero
About 3 klicks
(into microphone) Ethan, we're moments away
-  -  - Ethan and Ambrose rise from the fall
Ethan jumps up and sweeps Ambrose, dropping him to the ground
Ethan begins strangling Ambrose but gets knocked off, and when they both stand, Ambrose gets Ethan in a choke hold
Ambrose hits him and grabs a rock and hits Ethan in the midsection and the face
Ethan kicks it out of his hand and connects with several punches, knocking Ambrose to the ground
Kneeling, Ambrose pulls a knife from a boot holster and cuts Ethan across the back and face
Ambrose dives on Ethan and the knife is poised above Ethan's eye before Ethan grabs the knife and clears, holding it out toward Ambrose
Go ahead
Use it Hunt
It's not a bad way to go
lot better than the way that bitch is going to die
Ambrose swings again and misses, and Ethan delivers a series of kicks, leaving Ambrose stunned and barely standing
Ethan steps back, and with a running start, strikes Ambrose with a leaping kick that drops him to the ground and knock the knife out of his hand
/ -   - As they approach in the distance, Billy, Luther and Nyah finally gain sight of Ethan in hand-to-hand combat
-  -  - Ethan turns and walks away from Ambrose toward the cliff edge
The copter lands and Luther runs toward Ethan but pulls up, looking over Ethan's shoulder
Ambrose has a gun aimed at Ethan's back
Hunt
You should have killed me
Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by dust from the copter
Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air
He catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose
/  - Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter
Inches apart, they can only stare silently at one another
- Didgeridoo music
child admires a painting
Swanbeck and Ethan face one another
long, long pause
For a moment it appears as if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence
Sorry, Ethan
don't quite know where to begin
Any suggestions
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing
Why not
You've done just about everything else on this operation
'd thank you -- but 'm not sure that was a compliment
Of course it was
Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there
You try flogging the stories on  've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days
At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face
(picking up a file) Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus
Not even antibodies
Yes,  gathered as much
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose
Yes
And that appears to have been destroyed
It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus
'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed
By fire
That's the best way, really
So you didn't fail mission, you simply changed it
Ethan doesn't respond
(cont'd) It's no longer enough for you to execute and implement  policy, you now wish to go in the business of creating it
No,  don't
But in this case - In this case, it wasn't a bad idea
In face, it was a pretty damn good idea
Just don't make a habit of it
And, as for Ms
Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged
'm assuming you approve
do
Where is she now, by the way
Do you know
don't
No exactly
Well, Hunt, what are your plans
Not sure
Some sort of vacation
'll let you know where 'm going
Oh, you don't have to do that
Wouldn't be a vacation if you did
Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance
This incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about Mr
McCloy and Biocyte's financial difficulties -- including criminal allegations of insider trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit fraud, and stock parking -- have, understandably, sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting
-  () Ethan emerges to a very crowded street
Billy and Luther are waiting
Both look to Ethan
(worried) So what did he say
Good job
And thanks
(incredulous) That's it
That's it
That's it
(dryly, looking at Billy) And the check's in the mall
Right
Just remember, mates
Billy Baird's the name
Anything you need to get, move or watch, 'm your man
And Billy's gone
Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant to say anything, both reluctant to leave
One quick bear hug, then: Always nice hearing from you man
Stay in touch
And Luther's off
Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully
Then, curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd
After a half- dozen steps, something catches his eyes
He stops
One quick bear hug, then: (a tad wary) Do you know me
is inches from him
Without batting an eye
No
Should
No
You just looked as if you did
No
She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable conviction
(cont'd) just as if 'd like to
Oh
Well
He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for hers
(cont'd) think that can be arranged
Looks around at the swirling crowd: Let's get lost
And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the crowd
