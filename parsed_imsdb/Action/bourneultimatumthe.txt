There are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he has just moved into this job
Two other senior  officials sit in on the meeting
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott
(
) So we got in the way
Is that why Neski died
Is that why you killed Marie
Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file
(
) You killed Marie the minute you climbed into her car
The minute you entered her life she was dead
Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo
(
) told you people to leave me alone
fell off the grid was half way around the world
(
) There's no place it won't catch up to you
It's how every story ends
It's what you are, Jason
killer
You always will be
We think that's Bourne hitting him on the head and then-- He makes a gun with his hand, i

Bourne putting his gun to Abbott's head
(

Go on
Do it

That's the only reason your alive
The tape clicks off
Who's "she

His girlfriend, Marie
She was killed in India three weeks ago
Kramer looks down at another image
Abbott dead after his suicide
dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne
You couldn't make this stuff up
(holds up the photo of Abbot dead) You watched this happen
Landy nods
Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole situation
Bourne's last confirmed location is Moscow, three days ago
Right
So what does he do now
think he's looking for something he hasn't found
Like what
What's he after
'm not sure
Maybe he hasn't gotten his memory back yet
Not all of it
look from Kramer
Pam, what  need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us
If he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to
Maybe he still will
Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan don't know
just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst
"   As far as 'm concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise

The kind that displays a different advert every 15 seconds
He waits for the change and then--- --  huge field of vision across the concourse stretching out down below him- a sniper's heaven
pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes to work on it
Slowing the rotation
Rearranging the large triangular prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the trigger- and just enough cover to disappear
He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack

Traffic
(handing her the menu) Ma'am
Nothing for me
Vosen looks at her, surprised
'm buying
She shakes her head, no
She sits, without taking her coat off
She's not staying long
When the Director called, it was suggested we bring you on-- Suggested
(beat) Are you sure it was just a suggestion
Funny how different things look depending on where you sit look at this as doing a favor for you
Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business
Meaning
Jason Bourne
Bourne's finished
Really
It was finished the moment realized  was chasing him for something he didn't do
The case is closed
35 So what do you make of this
(handing her surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris) French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday
He threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started Treadstone
That's a big problem, wouldn't you agree
This doesn't feel like Bourne to me
Why's it so hard for you to believe
Probably because it's coming from you, Noah
Lets try and be adults okay
We all thought he was done, off the grid
But Bourne's back
Maybe he's a threat
We both want the same thing here
So what happened at Waterloo
We have a leak
Bourne showed up in our surveillance
We had very little time to react
And the reporter ended up dead
Bourne saw us coming
Landy looks at him, suspicious
So what was he doing
We don't know
But just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think
Maybe he's the source
36 The real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station
Don't second guess an operation from an armchair, Pam
It's not fair

0800 arrival, 12:05 departure
think we can be pretty certain that Bourne's not your source then
How
Ross's call to his editor, where he said he just met the source on Blackbriar, took place just after his flight landed
His met his source in Turin
So
So, what, Bourne met Ross for breakfast and then, at noon the same day Bourne calls Ross to demand a meet at Waterloo
(Needling Wills) Maybe they were even on the same flight
Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there start pounding keyboards
The guy you're after is a operative with clearance above Top Secret
He was committing treason by talking to Ross
Do you really think, while doing that, he used a cell phone he knows we can track
3 () Zero results on the cross check

Do you have a better idea
Yeah, 'd look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period Ross was in Turin

Response: "Everest"
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen
How long have you been on site
(
) just walked in
We have two officers on site
Are you in contact with them
(
) They're down
Unconscious, but alive
Is there any sign of Daniels
(
) No
Nicky, this is Pam Landy
We have reason to believe there is a connection between Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne
(
) Bourne, are you still looking for Bourne
thought the case was closed
No, some people are convinced he's still a threat
disagree but to find out  need to talk to him
seething because  has interrupted him
Hold on Nicky
Vosen hits the mute button
What are you doing
You know Bourne's probably listening
47 Landy doesn't answer
Vosen to Wills: How long till back up arrives
Wills holds up three fingers
Vosen unmutes

You still think he's after Daniels
Yeah
Nicky's just the means

Daniels knows everything
We can't let them meet

then: What are you after, Jason
Why are you looking for Daniels
Do you know who this is
Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table between them
She looks at the photo, points
That's Daniels
(points at Hirsch) don't know who that is

or 'll never be free of this
Who is he

Jason
that wasn't some one-off initiation
Daniels said they did that to you over and over again
That's how they
She doesn't finish
And Bourne doesn't ask her to
Just a long pause

They tracked Daniels' passport to a hotel in Tangier

This just keeps getting worse

'                                     145C Landy enters without knocking
Since when do you have authorization for lethal action against Daniels
Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco
So grab him-- don't have the people on the ground to do that and 'm not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands
What's going on
What's Daniels got
53 What's he got
He ran all of Blackbriar's operations in Southern Europe and North Africa
think the world's well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point, Noah
For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got our entire playbook
Names, dates, ghost sites, how we train our assets
You still don't have the authority to kill him
Oh, yes  do, Pam
Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe
It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol
" That's what makes us special
No red tape
No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order
Landy opens up the file
Sees the words "instantaneous lethal action is authorized when
" You just decide
No oversight
No checks and balances
Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw intel
You know how real the threat is
We can't afford to have our hands tied like that anymore

Bourne called Landy
Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub-- 203

) You look tired
Vosen realizes-- (rushing out) He's got line of sight on us

207
--                                              207 Wills walks over to Vosen
The look in his eye indicates that he thinks there's something odd about this: Landy just left the building
Vosen looks at Wills

Check Landy's phone
Is she using it

Nothing

240C
41  --                                         240C The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk
But Bourne is too fast
He's already past them
The passenger side agent jumps out
But he's still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on Bourne
The other  car races the wrong way on the street but gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel traffic
242A
'  --                                       242A Vosen and Wills race West on 41st

He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete ramps leading into and out of Port Authority
82 He runs across 10th Avenue as a third  car screams up the street at him

He jams the accelerator down
He'll be on top of Bourne -- running him over -- in seconds-- 260
--                                   260 New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees Bourne and the  car giving chase heading right at the bus
260A
--                                         260A The driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus
Bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete guard rail
The driver calls it in-- 261                                                   261 Cops and  cars close in on Port Authority
One agent jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the stairs
83 (
) Block every exit
want a full perimeter on Port Authority-- 262
--                      262 Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot
He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete railing at the east end of the roof
Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars
Smashes the window of one to set off its alarm
Then a second and a third, setting off their alarms
The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an alarm
Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in
Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks handful of wires off the steering column and starts to expertly hotwire the car
263
'  --                                        263 (into radio) Box him in

Two  cars careen up the ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus ramp we saw Bourne on earlier
)  third  car races through the parking level just below the roof and up the circular ramp to the roof
'  -- (to Vosen) He's on the roof
He's trapped
-- Bourne works to hotwire the car
car gets to the roof
Two agents come from the elevator lobby
The three car alarms distract them
They search for Bourne, but can't find him at first
Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still locked
84 second  car arrives
Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed
He smashes into the car across the aisle from him
With a sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops
Three  cars here now
Two head straight for him third blocks the exit ramp
Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower of an -4 (an -16 variant whose bullets can penetrate metal and concrete)
They move into position to get a bead on him
Bourne assesses
But he doesn't move
The agents swarm toward him
What the hell is he doing
Why is he waiting
267
'  --                                         267 We've got him
He's got nowhere to run
Take him out
268
--                       268 The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward Bourne-- But before they can get a bead-- Bourne slams the car into reverse again
Petal to the metal in reverse-- The agents open fire
Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield
But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass
As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the  agent adjusts his fire into the car's grill
Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's driveline
Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him
85 Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure
Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall
Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's car, to the shooters
Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25 feet and slams onto a row of parked cars
The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof
Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over- turned car
Ho-ly shit
269
'  --                                    269 (practically screaming into his handheld) He did what
270
--                    270 The  agents race to the spot where Bourne's car disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into Bourne's car but they're too late
Bourne's already out
He disappears from sight under the covered parking structure
Get down there
Get down

'  --                                      271 As it speeds toward the spaghetti of ramps leading in and out of Port Authority -- two blocks away
Who has eyeball on him
Who has eyeball
86 271A
--                  271A One of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to climb down
Other agents race for the stairs

) Don't tell me-- 274

--            275 Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him
Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd  sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge
The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car
The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on
Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode
Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents
87 Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another  sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one
The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver
The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life
As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires
The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan
An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it
With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first  sedan
Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire
The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot
The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officer's radio
10-13
Shots fired
Officer down
Port Authority parking lot
Level four
Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer
Then he hands the cop his radio back
(') Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive
Bourne disappears
We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits
agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up the  car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps
But that's all the time Bourne needs-- 88 276                                                          276 277
--                                  277 Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east, followed closely by a  sedan
As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into Bourne's wake but a  sedan punches the taxi back to the right
It ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control
277A                                                     277A 280                                                          280 281
--                                  281 Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful  Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out by hitting his bumper
Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car
The  sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision and blocks the path of the other  sedan
282
'  --                                      282 Bourne is home free
He looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / 95
" Bourne turns right-- Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of Bourne's leg
Paz, his  racing along the curb lane
As Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of Bourne's car
Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car
With his front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his car as another  sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's car by sliding into his path
283                                                          283 89 284
--                                   284 Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the  Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit
Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of
Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path
Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards
As Bourne's car plows through the 's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake
Paz and the  sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto South St
as Paz and the  sedan overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle
284A                                                       284A 287
'  --                                       287 On his police radio, Bourne singles out an  officer (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just ahead
Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right: The  car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection
As he does, the cop car Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the  sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car
Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the oncoming traffic
Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a -Rail dividing the street ahead
The nearly upended car grinds down the -Rail until the rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the front of Paz's , knocking the  sideways, into a row of parked cars
Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the road

Bourne's profile is up on Screen 2
It says "David Webb ( Jason Bourne)" on the profile tech comes to Wills
Sir, this may be nothing but, look at Bourne's birthday
Wills looks at the profile
Bourne's birthdate is listed as 9/13/70
What about it
Well, Landy told Bourne his birthday was 4/15/71 so
Wills gets it instantly
Everything stops

Wills grabs his headset-- 288A

Landy gave Bourne a false birthday
Wills thinks it's a code
It sinks in for Vosen
oh
shit

He dials a number-- 304
--                            304 Bourne reaches 71st street and 2nd Ave
He looks up at the sign
306
'    (   ) --  306 Hirsch's office is located in the 's "front office", which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of the hospital
He is the longtime head of  and a powerful behind-the-scenes official at
, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled with
He's a 45 year  veteran
One of the great brains in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect
His phone buzzes
93 ( ) Hello
306A
'  --                       306A at the other end of the line -- ( ) Bourne knows everything
think he's heading for you right now
Dead pause
306
'  (   )--         306 ( ) He's coming home, Noah
There's a wistfulness in the way he says it
But also the sense that this was absolutely inevitable
And he's calm about it, doesn't show any fear, doesn't reach for a gun
( ) How long do  have
Not long
Get out of there
No
'm going to stay
Are you crazy, he'll-- He'll come to the training wing
That's what he knows
'll keep him in play until you arrive
309R
--  --              309R Bourne arrives at the "Johnston Medical Center
"   He looks up to see "415"
FB5                                                        FB5 The image of "415" that has been haunting his dreams
309
--  --                  309 This is the place
When he looks down Landy steps out of the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk
94 They'll kill you for giving me this place
4/15/71 isn't much of a code
My guess is Vosen's already on his way
Why'd you do it
This isn't us, David
What they turned you into, what they're doing with Blackbriar
This has to stop
Then stop it
Everything you need is in there
Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital
David
Come in with me
It's better if we do this together
(shakes head) This is where it started for me, this is where it ends
She watches the doors close behind him
Landy lets him go

: --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the Blackbriar Operations File
-- cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"
"potentially explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"
--Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of victims
Next to the victim from the inciting incident, the words: " citizen"

Future victims
" citizen" stamped next to each one

Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes
309R
--   --      309R Landy walks down the street
She looks up to spot two black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs coming up York
Shit-- 323
'  --                              323 block south of the hospital, stuck in traffic, Vosen points
Landy
Right there
She's got Bourne's backpack
310R
8TH    --              310R Bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the access card to enter a secure corridor-- 323

Still a half block from the entry door but it's close enough-- 322
322 Bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor-- 325

96 (to a group of six agents) 'll find Landy
You get to the training wing and get Bourne
security guard comes over
Do you know who  am
(the guard nods) Where's your security room
324
324 Landy looks around
Finds an open office
She pushes open the door and runs to the fax machine
She starts faxing the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe
324A
--                           324A Vosen enters
want to see all your footage for the last three minutes
322
(   ) --  322 Bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams, the corridor Daniels lead him down in his flashback
We see Bourne go into-- FBA3                                                       FBA3 That first day, Bourne's  being led down this corridor by Daniels
322                                                          322 Bourne moves down the corridor
322
(   ) --  322 Bourne reaches the end of the hall
He looks around "flashback style" -- 97 FBB3                                                    FBB3 Bourne was standing at this door
331
--                                   331 Vosen enters the room
The last pages have been faxed
You better get a good lawyer
She exits
322                                                       322 Then spins, gun up-- Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him
Put the gun down
wouldn't be here if  didn't want to talk
've spent three years running
Three years trying to find out who  was
Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun
You still don't have it all back, do you
You haven't filled in all the pieces
Let's start with the moment you found out  wouldn't execute Wombosi
The amnesia wasn't the issue, it was the fact that didn't pull the trigger
One lapse meant your conditioning had failed
Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott
They were just following orders
Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall
Searches him for weapons
98 (completely calm) 'm unarmed, Jason
(shoving Hirsch hard against the wall) "David
" 'm David Webb
Bourne's face-- You were David Webb, but not anymore
322
--             322 Bourne stands with Hirsch
Why me
Why did you pick me
beat
You really don't remember, do you
(beat) You picked us, Jason
What does that mean
You volunteered
Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall
The "room in use" sign lights up
Bourne looks up "flashback style"-- FBA1                                                     FBA1 Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from the first day
322
322 Bourne and Hirsch enter
You volunteered right here
You didn't even blink, Jason
You just handed me these
99 Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket
Holds them out to Bourne
Bourne takes the dog tags
Stares at them
of the dog tags: Webb, David 946610190 Negative Catholic FB9                                                       FB9 Bourne hands over his dog tags
(') Has everything been explained to you
Yes, sir
322                                                      322 You were a soldier ready to serve his country
Just like thousands of others, except you were a prodigy with languages
and a perfect shot

Instead you just turned me into a killer
Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch
You could have left at any time
And you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay
100 FB9                                                         FB9 When we're finished with you, you'll no longer be David Webb

You chose to come here
You chose to stay
And no matter how much you want to forget it
eventually you're going to have to face how you chose, right there, to become Jason Bourne
FB10   :                                                 FB10 Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible
Hirsch looks at him from behind the desk
(') You haven't slept for a long time have you David
Have you made a decision
This can't go on, you know
You have to decide
Who is he
We've been through that
What did he do
It doesn't matter
(beat) You came to us
You volunteered
You said you'd do anything it takes to save American lives
You're not a liar are you
Or too weak to see this through
This is it
Let go of David Webb
Will you give yourself to this program
101 Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand
He gets to his feet swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded figure
The man slumps over
Bourne stares at what he's done
(') You're no longer David Webb
From now on you'll be known as Jason Bourne
Welcome to the program
Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is dead
Just then Kramer walks through the door
He's ready
Send him to Operations
322                                                         322 And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback
He stares back at Hirsch
Do you remember now
Bourne lowers the gun
remember
remember everything
You can't outrun what you did, Jason
You made yourself into who you are
'm done running
That's why 'm here
To end you, to shut this down
'm no longer Jason Bourne
So now you're going to kill me
No
You don't deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley
Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door
It's locked
102 322
322 The agents fire at the door handle to get it open
322
322 Bourne looks out a window
Sees the layout of a roof several stories below
Then he turns and shoots out the room's mirrored observation window
Bourne dives through it just as agents rush in and open fire at him
Bourne races through corridors, loosing the  agents
352
--                                           352 Bourne runs out onto the roof
Rushes across it to look over the edge
It's a straight drop to the  -- 12 stories down
He races to another ledge -- the East River below him
But he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of the building to hit the water
He backs up to get a running leap
As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on him
Why didn't you take the shot
Bourne looks at him
Do you even know why you're trying to kill me
Look at what they make you give
Bourne turns and runs off the roof
Paz fires into the air
Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the freezing river-- -- Bourne goes into the river
