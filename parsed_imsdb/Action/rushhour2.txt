People panic and run
Hu Li doesn't even flinch
She takes a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned street vendor

'  - The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in a Chinese-cut suit
He's holding a Chinese-English dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me" look to two girls in a convertible

The   speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who is driving and singing to his radio
(singing) wish they all could be California

Carter ejects the    from the stereo and  it out of the

That was my
Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's
Did you see the way those girls drove off
did you a favor
Those girls drove off because of you
All  did was invite them for a drink
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat
(checking Chinese-English dictionary) said that
Which word was "goat
" Lee picks up his  case
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee
've been here three days and we haven't done shit
We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl

Mu-shu
You're hungry
Not Mu-shu

Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu
Carter flips through the dictionary
in over '
'  - The following conversation is in Chinese, English subtitles
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy
Two American translators were killed
Any leads
(beat) We think it's Ricky Tan
If you don't want to take the case, 'll understand
It's my responsibility
Lee hangs up the cell phone
What was that
Did you just pick up a case
Did we just take another damn case on my vacation
Lee smiles at Carter
Of course not
My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight
Big party
Don't be messing with me, Lee
will kick your ass
'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty
Carter, would  lie to you
- Carter follows Lee out of the car, the two men making their way to the door of the Raven Club
Carter is combing his hair, getting himself ready for a night on the town, stopping when he spots two hot  walking into the club
That's what 'm talking about

You want an Altoid
No
You better take one
Your breath has been a little funky all day
Let me look at you
Carter looks at Lee
Fixes his collar
(') Just relax and don't worry about a thing
'll hook you up in there
You got condoms
No
Take this
It's a Magnum
You can fold it in half
Carter dances through the door, Lee follows
- dark, upscale club that is packed with , and
Lee and Carter walk in
Lee is trying to keep a low profile as Carter stares up at the stage, where a man sings Karaoke -- the most painful rendition of Michael Jackson's "'  '
" 'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes
They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in
Blend in
'm two feet taller than everyone here
Where you going
Bathroom
Lee walks off, trying not to be seen as Carter steps up to the bar, takes a seat next to
How you boys doing tonight
The thugs ignore Carter as he motions to the stage, where the continues to sing
(') That is the worst singing 've ever heard
That sounds like something you'd hear in prison after lights out
The thugs continue to ignore Carter
-   - Lee makes his way down a hallway -- looks through an open door - sees a private room
Several  are using hi-tech to count stacks of

) Get closer to my body now
And just love me, till you don't know how
Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "'  ' " - room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open, watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael Jackson, singing his heart out
Dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him
(whispering from side of stage) Carter, get off that stage
Are you kidding, they love me
'm a star, Lee
god to these people
Carter resumes singing, really getting down
Moonwalking to the  of the  where Lee
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover
knew you were lying
'm sorry
Damn it, why are you ruining my night
'm just starting to have fun
(beat) Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is
We must tread softly and keep our ears open
Tread softly
Who taught you how to roost a bar
Carter, you don't understand
These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads
Part of the most deadly gang in China
Man, are you crazy
You think that scares me
'm from
We invented gangs
We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it
We get royalties from other gangs
Now gimme your badge and gun and 'll show you how it's done
No
You are a civilian
In China,  am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto
You mean Tito
We had  Toto for dinner last night
Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun
Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and fires three  into the ceiling, silencing the bar
(') (Chinese) Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang lui
Nobody moves
Strange looks from the crowd
Carter turns to Lee
(') (whispering) What'd  say
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking
Shit
'mon, get up here and help me out
Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage
More looks from the Chinese as Carter speaks, Lee translating
(') Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go to that side, all fine ass women on this side
Nobody moves
Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling
(') Let's try this again
Who here knows Ricky Tan, raise your hand
Nobody moves
(') Who here is named Lee
Raise your hand
Nobody moves
(') Now  know you're lying
The crowd still hasn't moved
Except in the back, where Lee spots several  leaving
As Lee runs off stage -- (') (as they run out) come back and catch y'all singing Michael Jackson and you're all going to jail

Stop
Lee takes off and chases them on foot

With the advantage, he them with his bamboo pole and knocks them off
He climbs after the

Gun low and ready
Hu Li is gone

Nobody move
Carter goes to the edge and sees Lee hanging on a pole below
Carter is blind-sided by Hu Li
She takes one sultry step towards him, then twists her heel and  a   that sends Carter He falls along the side of the building
He manages to grab the end of a   that juts out from the scaffolding
They're hanging side-by-side, holding on for their lives
Hu Li looks down at them
She has no weapon to finish them off
She turns and runs, disappearing in the night
holding on with all their strength
The bamboo is starting to bend

Try to land on your feet
Carter looks down at a rancid dumpster below them

The : 2: '    - Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in silence, bruised and covered in garbage
You lied to me
'm sorry
You're sorry

Just take me home
No time
There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed
Carter takes this in
Can't believe his own bad luck
So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy

The students  and form an "" with their arms
Master Fu notices Carter and Lee watching from the back
(') Twisting Tiger
No response
The students exchange baffled looks
(' (') (staring straight at Lee) Twisting Tiger
Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move that leaves the students blown away
Lee smiles, basking in the glow
until he sees Master Fu's disappointment
(') Didn't  teach you to always arch your back
(bowing, humbled) Yes, Master
While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 , who sit motionless around a fighting circle
Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up
was watching you kids
My name is Carter, , and 'm a third degree black belt
At least that's what  tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where  work out
Carter throws a series of  , but the kids have no reaction
(') Let me give you kids some tips
The key to Kung Fu is the follow through
Why don't you stand up
' , no reaction
Carter continues to throw punches
(') Go ahead, kick me, hit me
'll show you how to block
Come on, stand up, give me your best shot -- try to kick right to my head
The kids still don't move
Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his ,   over the behind him -- a mistake
He swings back around to face the kids and     that sends him flying back onto the mat
He looks around and sees  of the kids , in
(') That's pretty good
Which one of you kids did that
- Lee and Master Fu walking
need your help, Master

He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal
Animals kill only from hunger or fear
The man you seek is lower than a serpent

In the b

, we see the kids leaping acrobatically over Carter from all sides
Carter, frustrated, tries to grab the kids out of the air as they fly by, but they elude him
They disappear
Lee and Master Fu walk another moment, Master Fu lost in thought
(') He was the best  ever trained, you know
Ricky Tan
No
Your father
(Lee reacts) Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students
and for such awful things to happen as they did -- Lee cuts off Master Fu's reminisces -- he's obviously uncomfortable
How do  find Ricky Tan
, Carter and the flying kids go zipping by in the other direction, disappear
Master Fu pats the  around a struggling plant
seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven
know, Master, but
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth
Heaven on Earth
Master,  don't understand
(working it) temple, where Heaven is on Earth mountain, where Earth reaches for the -- It's a massage parlor downtown
"Heaven on Earth
"  You will find your answers there
Lee bows to Master Fu, slowly turns to walk back down the pathway
(') Wait
Put a c-note in the jar
Lee puts a few bills in the jar, heads down a pathway
Master Fu walks over and takes the cash
(') Cheap bastard
- Lee emerges from the path, stops when he sees Carter -- two students headlocked under each arm, another two scissor locked between his legs, holding another two down with his hands, and sitting on the last one
And that's how you use the  choke hold
Now start practicing and don't make me come back here
Carter
you ready to have some fun
- neon light hangs above the upscale massage parlor
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist

Good afternoon, gentlemen
Lee bows, followed by Carter

Oh, you American
That's right
You bring American money
(holding up a Platinum AmEx) Never leave home without it

You save your money
The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a - slides it open to reveal Carter truly is in Heaven
You get massage from Chinese girl before
No
It's my first time
You pick any girl for you and your friend
Carter looks like a kid in a candy store
Any girl
Okay
Let's start with that one
Oh yes, she's very nice
She is nice
But  am very tense

Lee elbows Carter

She said  could pick any girl  want
Well, hurry up
Hey
You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line
(to Lee) Your friend have big appetite
(handing  to Lee and Carter) Please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room
- in   lie in reclining chairs, women massaging their feet and hands
There are   's showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the background
Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in Lee wears , Carter wears his Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same time
walks over and hands them each a drink
Now 'm on vacation

doesn't respond man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality
(') What's wrong
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan
That's Ricky Tan
He's four feet tall
'll go over with you right now, shake him down
This is a very dangerous man
'm a dangerous man
You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat
'm calling for back up
Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits
Carter looks at   -- sitting quietly in his chair with his   on his knees
Carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him
Ricky Tan, 've been looking all over for you
Get up
Tan looks up for a moment, a smile
'm busy at the moment
said get on your feet
know you, Detective Carter, right
You're Lee's American friend
Enjoying your visit
'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you
This is the only color they had left
Now get up
Tan laughs, goes back to his laptop from Ricky and throws it across the room - against the wall
Ricky glances at his men who are seated around the room waiting to move
(') told you to get on your feet
Having heard the commotion, Lee arrives by Carter's side, breathless, as Tan looks up, surprised
Lee, 've missed you, brother
(getting up, giving Lee a hug) heard about the two Americans, 'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure
You must come with me for questioning
Let's go
've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me

nod of Ricky Tan's head, and    in robes and towels spring out of reclining chairs -- menacingly facing Lee and Carter
beat
'd like to pay you for that laptop
It's no problem
But  must excuse myself, inspector
That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted
Tan bows to Lee and Carter
Congratulations
And good day
As Tan starts to exit, Lee and Carter move to intercept him
But they are blocked by '
Lee grabs one of the men's towels and pulls it off
The man covers his naked body
Lee is grabbed by one of the other henchmen, but he escapes and begins kicking ass, using the towel and his own robe to block and wrap another man's arms -- blocking, kicking, and punching everything in sight -- all the while managing to keep his privates covered with a towel, his robe, or some other found object
Carter, meanwhile, uses his quick hands to send several men flying back -- grabbing a towel of one of them
(ref: his privates) Damn
No wonder you're pissed off
Carter uses the towel like Lee did to block and trap one of the men's punches
In the middle of fighting, Lee is suddenly exposed -- he flinches to cover himself and is punched from behind
Momentarily stunned, he's lifted from behind -- two men throwing him out the front door
Carter is also overpowered by two men, who lift him over their shoulders
- Ricky Tan's black limo  to a stop
The door flies open and Lee and Carter are  out onto the highway
Both men are completely naked
- packed street - Lee and Carter dodging in and out of people
The   and we see Lee and Carter from behind
Goddamn you got a small ass
Don't look at my ass
-  - The station is packed with Americans --  , they've set up shop right in the middle of the bullpen

Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the  and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need
If you have information, it belongs to us
This is still Hong Kong
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people
No
He will report to me
Do we understand each other
turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen
Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash can lid, Carter using a red construction cone
(') Who the hell is that
(humiliated) That is
Chief Inspector Lee
The detective in charge of our investigation
Put a diaper on him, Chin
want to talk to the great Inspector Lee
'  - The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting on a suit and fixing his tie
Carter finishes putting on a     from Lee's closet, then moves for the door
Where are you going
Back to Heaven on Earth
need my damn passport back
'm going home
Fine
Go home
Who needs you
Why you mad at me
You needed back-up, so  backed you up
was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards
Stop
'm sick of your bullshit
My bullshit
'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters
'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords
It's my job
You're pathetic, man
When's the last time you had some fun
When's the last time you took a night off, had a date
have plenty of dates
Really
When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it
Year of the rat
You would never understand my life
You're not Chinese
And you ain't black
The two men look at each other for a long
Lee quickly walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half dressed
'  - Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk
Chin stands in the back
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service
The Secret Service
Why
What 'm about to tell you cannot leave this room
The men who were killed yesterday were not American translators
They were undercover
customs agents trying to break a Triad smuggling ring
We don't know what they're transporting out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it got the agents killed
How can we help
Stay the hell out of our way
can get to Ricky Tan
We know all about Tan
That's why we're leaving him out there as bait
We think this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads
'  - Carter is on the phone, his feet on Lee's desk
As he talks he opens a drawer, pulls out a wad of cash and pockets it
Captain, you're gonna have to speak up
'm on a car phone
'  -   - sits behind his desk talking on the phone
Is it true, Carter
Are you in Hong Kong right now
Hong Kong
'm not in Hong Kong
'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station
How about  pick you up right now and take you to dinner
It's nine-thirty in the morning
Did  say dinner
meant diner
Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter
was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the
There was a dinner last night, two hundred  officers were there
Two hundred cops
Was Mario Sanchez there
He owes me money
've waited my whole life for this job, but  don't have a shot in hell of getting it
Do you know why
Is it because of the hookers, sir
You tell them there's no crime in being lonely
No, Carter
The reason 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong
And what the hell is Heaven on Earth
Sir, 'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time  get back they're gonna make you Governor
Captain, you there

He motions to an   who is selling , How you doing

Now way anyone held back by the heat

Pause
Carter strolls back  , peering into the store to see if it's worth staying

Superindendent Chin approaches
All he wanted was some mu-shu
Are you okay, Lee

Carter ducks to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a waiting Daimler
The Daimler drives off
Carter rushes to the middle of the street with a determined look on his face

The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter

Follow that car
Where it goes, you go
This is a chase -- we are chasing that limo

This is the opposite of chasing -- drive the car or  will kill you
The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand
Carter fishes in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash
Now you speak my language

playing over the stereo
Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in tribute to Carter

He's got the big party smile on, but as Hu Li arrives, Reign's face shifts and his eyes go dead -- the billionaire as sociopath
Carter steps back, but sees Reign Whisper to Hu Li
Carter hides and turns away as Hu Li instinctively scans the room for signs of trouble
He heads into the main party
Carter stops walking when he comes upon  , a stunning brunette, sitting at the bar drinking a glass of champagne
Carter lights her cigarette for her
How you doing, baby

(') Why don't we go on the deck, get some air
and some privacy
(to Hu Li) Leave us alone
Hu Li hesitates, upset at being dismissed
(') (to Lee) Could you have your partner wait for us outside
ain't his partner, 'm a tourist got proof
See,  got a mini-bar key
(to Carter) 'll meet you on the main deck in ten minutes
Carter pulls Lee aside
What, leave you alone so he can cap you
'm okay, you go
Why the hell should you believe him
He had us beat up
Naked
That's nasty shit
Remember  told you my father was a policeman
(beat) Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years
(pause) What the hell is going on here
No answer
Carter holds Lee's glance for a beat, then turns and walks the other way
'  -   - Tan and Lee reach the upper deck, where they are alone
Despite what people suspect
what you suspect -- Don't
Ricky Tan hears the steel in Lee's voice, acknowledges it
if your father were alive,  would be turning to him now
(beat) didn't blow up the American Embassy, but  believe some of my people did
My enemies are trying to frame me
(beat) There is a war going on within the Triads -- and  am going to lose
My name has been written into the book of death
The police can protect you
Nobody can protect me
'll make a deal with you, Lee
But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong
Tell me why they killed the customs agents
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor
Hu Li  onto the deck, flanked by
Ricky Tan screams something at Hu Li in Chinese
Hu Li screams back as      '
Tan falls back, over the rail, and into the water
Lee    , but the four bodyguards are on Lee, attacking from all sides
Hu Li exits as Lee tries to fight off the bodyguards
'  -   - Reactions from the crowd as  echo from the deck above
'  - Hu Li moves quickly down the hallway, rounding a corner and suddenly goes , landing flat on her face
It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and Hu Li with his leg
All right, get your hands up
Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head
- Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on one
furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and Bodyguard #2
'  - Carter and Hu Li face off
You wanna piece of me
'mon, 'll give you a little  ass kickin'
Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows
- Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4
As he catches his breath the sound of a   starting its engines
Hu Li
Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a starting to pull away from the ship
Hu Li jumps onboard the moving boat
Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the stern
-  - Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time -- watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat
Carter turns his head, sees -- --   at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland shooting
Wordlessly, Reign disappears back into the shadows
- The yacht is anchored
few  led away in handcuffs
Thrown into   that have surrounded the docks
Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock
Quite a night, Inspector
Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone
You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a
Government investigation
What "revenge" is he talking about
don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case
don't ever want to see you again, you got that
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- Stay out of it, Carter
You're going back to
Fine with me
Sterling walks away disgusted
'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service
Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment
Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to approach
(') (to police officers) Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- 'll take him
Hell no
The Hong Kong police officers produce
Beat
(') (to Lee) Fine
But don't expect me to talk to you
Carter stalks off
Don't push me, Carter
'm in no mood for your bullshit
Carter gets in Lee's face
The two men look like they're about to come to blows
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper
'll bitch slap you into Bangkok
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy
Don't be talking about my mama
Or my ass
heard your mama pulls a rickshaw
No
She's a school teacher
You're not very good at this, are you
Good at what
Forget it
long beat while Lee considers what to say
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case
Ask me if  give a shit
Lee waits a beat, then drops the bombshell
Ricky Tan killed my father
Carter is suddenly all ears, listening intently now to Lee
(') He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along
(beat) Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty
How the hell did Tan get away with it
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved
Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly
(pause) This is about your Daddy's death
Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job
You could have told me
(realizing) This is about more than all that, isn't it
This is about your Daddy's last case, right
Lee's caught, fibs badly
No, no, that would be crazy -- You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case
That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing
thought you'd think it was crazy
know
know
am sorry
Lee inclines his head, stiffly, turns and walks toward his car
Carter watches him
Finally he rolls his eyes and yells
So are you getting on the plane or not
What
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal
Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first
cannot go to
Carter steps close, and for a second we see the man and the cop beneath the attitude
It sounds impossible -- You said -- -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, 'd go to hell to do it
Carter turns, walks away without looking back
(') You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane
Why
(still not turning) guess you're going to have to trust me on this one
747 Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other passengers, preparing to take off
Lee has a moment of doubt
should go back
Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man
Follow the Rich White Man
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word
Follow the RichWhiteMan
Not bad
Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut
Every single one
Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign
Who
Big hotel billionaire
He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked
How do you know he's our man
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool
See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh
Aaaahh
You sound like that all the time
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down
Maybe
But not like Asians
We never panic
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming
You people were screaming your asses off
Just tell me where  can find this Steven Reign
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen
(a tray arrives) Gefilte Fish
Lox and bagel
love this stuff
Here, try it with a smear
-- Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars
Lee standing next to him
: -   - Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down hotel room
The  , the curtains open a crack
- Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel
Stopping at the penthouse floor - where we see  talking with Steven Reign in a hotel room
After a , Reign walks to the door
Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel,  told you this would work out
They still just talking
He just left
Kissed her on the cheek
He'll be back soon
How do you know
Look at her
Now, wake me in an hour, 'll take over
Lee lowers the binoculars, turns to Carter, who is trying to sleep on the bed
Carter, there's something  have to tell you
You were right about what you said in Hong Kong
All  do is work
Never take a day off
It's all  have right now
Hey,  didn't mean to call you pathetic
The truth is,  haven't had any mu-shu in six months
You pull a muscle or something
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding
'm sorry, Lee
Why did she leave you
It's a long story
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive
've seen it a million times
No
It was my singing
Excuse me
She hated my voice
Said it drove her crazy
sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower -  thought she liked it
She finally told me it was driving her crazy
Carter stares at Lee for a long
Lee, maybe it's best if we don't discuss our personal lives
Let's die curious
- turns back to the building
(') What's she doing
- She walks to the bedroom, where we see her through Slowly taking off her coat
(') Lee
You okay
Lee's eyes go wide as Isabella drops her coat and starts to unbutton her blouse
She's just standing around -- not doing much
Just don't fall asleep
Sooner or later something's gonna happen
'll try to stay awake
It's so boring
Isabella starts to remove her blouse
Lee starting to sweat as he watches her undress
(') Slow down, baby
What did you say
Nothing
said nothing
Lee lowers his binoculars, steps away from the window
(') Is it hot in here
Hot
'm freezing my ass off
'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice
You want some ice
What's going on
Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed
She's getting undressed
Gimme the binoculars
No
It's not right
Gimme the binoculars or  will shoot you
Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as Carter watches to the window
What's she doing
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah
don't want to hear this
Skirt just came off
She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh
it looks like Snoopy
Snoopy
love Snoopy
She just took her hair down
Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands
(to Lee) You better get that ice
Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view
That's enough
We shouldn't be doing this
Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the
We see her clearly now in bra and panties
This is our job
We took an oath as police officers
If we don't do this, who will
Firemen
Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window
He sees Isabella hang up the phone
(') Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs
What
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg
Oh, God
please don't let it be a dick
What is it
No,  don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone
Lee, she's wired
As she turns to the window
in hand
She puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom and puts on a robe
don't understand
She's walking back towards the door
We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her hotel room talking with someone
(') She opened the door
Someone is delivering a package
Inside the hotel room     handing her a package
(') Lee
it's the girl who delivered the package to your office
It's a bomb
Lee and Carter bolt on the move - sprinting out of the room
-   - Isabella closes the door
She      as she walks into the bedroom -- - Carter and Lee run across the street, heading towards the entrance of the hotel
-  - Lee and Carter sprint out the Penthouse Elevators, running down the hallway
-   - Isabella takes her robe off, glances at the package, picks it up and starts to open it as Lee and Carter come the
/ Carter and Lee stare at Isabella, who stands in bra and panties
Damn girl, you fine
Lee lowers his eyes as Isabella looks at him, grabbing the , Carter following him as they sprint out the bedroom
- Lee and Carter run out the suite - Lee throwing the toward the     as he and Carter dive to the floor
Nothing happens
Lee looks up,  a   pushing a room service , about to walk right past the package -- Lee and Carter run back to the bomb
Pick it up
It's your turn
don't need a turn
Carter picks it up, starts running with it through the hall, heading for the elevator
Throw it
Carter is about to throw it in, when Do you want us to hold the elevator
Get the hell away from here
Carter is still holding the bomb, doesn't know what to do with it -- Stairs
Carter throws him the bomb, and Lee runs to the stairs -- - Lee is about to throw the bomb down the stairwell -- when he sees    toward him
Get out of the building
Lee looks horrified as he hangs onto the package, has no choice but to throw it back to Carter
Roof
-  - Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible
He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets are filled with
Wait
There's people down there
There's people up here
Get it out of here
Take it
Lee takes the bomb, quickly   across the roof -- Lee and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof - She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package
Get on your feet
Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella begins to open the package
wouldn't do that
It's a bomb
Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a You see, no bomb
Now stay away before throw you both in jail for obstruction
Throw us in jail
'm about to bust you right now
'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service
How do we know you're not lying
Let me see your badge
Isabella opens her bathrobe --   a small  pinned to her bra
(') Let me see it again
We can help you
'm a detective in Hong Kong
know who you are, Inspector Lee
Then you know 'm not walking away from this case
Yeah, that's right
We need to get out of sight
Come down to my suite
'  - (she locks the door) Look, 've been working this case for months now
So what's your story
They think 'm a crooked customs agent
Lee examines the stack of    from Hu Li's package
Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge
Is this a payoff
No
It's a sample
You guys ever heard of the Superbill
It's a myth
Some kind of counterfeit
It's much more than a counterfeit
14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference
The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on Intaglio presses
How're they getting into the
Mint to use the presses
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran
We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a
Treasury Intaglio press
The only one to ever leave the country
Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market
Five years ago
(beat) That's right before he left the force
Lee and Carter exchange looks
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year
Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills
(understanding) And Hu Li killed him for the plates
Yes
They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake
Isabella lights a    on fire, and it burns (') They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money
The real question is, where are the plates
If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation
Isabella thinks for a beat
(') Maybe that's where you can help us
Carter, this is your city, right
Carter nods
(') And Lee, you know Hu Li and the Triads
Lee nods
(') Okay, find out where Hu Li's keeping the plates
(hands Lee a card with a phone number) Welcome aboard, gentlemen
From this moment on, you're working for the United States Secret Service
Isabella opens the door to let Lee and Carter out
They exit quickly, trying to hide their excitement
on Isabella as she takes out her  , punches in a number
(
) Sterling
Lee and Carter are officially out of the Secret Service's way
- Lee and Carter, both wearing dark sunglasses, walk through the street trying their best to look like Secret Service Agents
They approach Carter's parked
Secret Service Agent Carter
This is my calling, Lee
Give me six months and 'll be in Washington protecting a white guy
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else
They don't know that
What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview
'll bet Isabella can pull some strings
You saw the way she was staring at me
She never even looked at you
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me
'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly
am not third world ugly
Women like me, they think 'm cute
Like Snoopy
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you
'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance
Carter's had the last word, he gets into the Vette
Lee reluctantly gets in, too
-     - Carter's Vette pulls up in front of a hole in the wall
- Carter and Lee pass through the restaurant, only two tables are occupied
Carter and Lee enter the busy kitchen where the , a named , is yelling in Chinese to an over worked waiter
Kenny's wife, a spectacular looking Chinese woman, works the stove
couple of cute half-black, half Asian kids run around the kitchen
Kenny
How you doin'
Kenny looks up at Carter
cool, appraising glance
(') How's the action tonight
The house making out okay
Kenny follows as Carter opens a door to -- - seated around several card tables, playing - for big money
Lee and Kenny follow Carter inside
It's very smokey and very crowded
(to Kenny) This is where  say 'm  in a loud voice, they all scream and run and shit
Watch
It's real funny
Kenny grabs Carter's shoulder, pulling him aside
Come with me
- Kenny leads Carter and Lee in, closes the door
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James
What
Where'd you hear that
got my sources
And  got mine, meaning you
Nice how that works out
(beat) 'm serious this time, 'm closing this place down
James, you see my kids back there
You know how much 'm paying for private school
How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate
Jail
James, you better back off
Badge or no badge, 'll kick your ass
'd like to see you try
Kenny takes a step back and throws a lightning fast martial arts move
Lee gets in front of Carter to protect him -- countering Kenny's move
(to Lee) We're on, then
Kenny throws out another precision martial arts sequence -- Lee  -- Kenny ends in an advanced fighting stance
(impressed) That's a good Twisting Tiger -- where did you learn that
They switch to Chinese
Master Ching taught me
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing
No
Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw
Lee smiles, Carter looks back and forth from Lee to Kenny
(') What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck
Baby Duck
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking
Never shut up
heard that
Lee and Kenny laugh
(') Look,  need some info and  don't have time to play around
Is this about the funny money
How'd you know
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning
How come you always save me for last, James
When are you gonna learn
Shit don't happen  don't know about
So tell me what you know
know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you
Yeah
We already been there
This is big, Kenny
Benjamins
Secret Service calls 'em superbills
Banks can't even tell the difference
Kenny considers this for a moment
(') What
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing
Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills
knew something was wrong
Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash
But  tested the bills, infrared
The whole thing
And they checked out
100%
Do you still have the bills
still have my lunch money from third grade
Lemme see 'em
Kenny pushes a Chinese painting aside to reveal a
He opens the safe and hands Carter a $100 bill
Carter checks it out
See
It's perfect
Carter takes out a  and holds the flame to it
(') Whoa, what are you doing
Kenny's question is answered as the
(') (pissed off) knew it
The guy's name is Zing
He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza
All right, Kenny
Thanks
You're off the hook
For now
Carter and Lee move for the door
You sure you guys don't want to stay and have a bite
My wife's got the best mu shu this side of Compton
Carter and Lee exchange a look as we  : - Establishing
Carter and Lee park their car and walk inside
- Carter and Lee enter
(to a worker) We're looking for a guy named Zing
Is he here
Zing hears Carter, turns and sees them
Then
Carter and Lee exchange looks and run after him
- Zing sprints down an employee hallway, through a doorway and down some stairs
Carter and Lee in pursuit
-   - Carter and Lee burst out the door at the bottom of the stairway -- coming almost face to face with -- Who has her gun out
Waiting for them
is standing near by, and  is visible off to the side
An 18- in the loading bay is just being shut and locked
is parked beside it
Lee and Carter both assume fighting positions
When most of the other  pull guns; other   step out, putting their guns close on Lee and Carter
They can't blink without getting mowed down
(in Chinese) The great Chief Inspector Lee --  will be remembered for ridding the Triads of your petulance
Hu Li savors the moment
hope you just said  have no business being here, 'cos  was just leaving
Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him, freezing him in his tracks
Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks
Hu Li,  think there's someone who will want to talk to them first
Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement
Lee falls
Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun
Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li  him across the jaw with her fist
oh, that's a filling right there
That's gonna cost you
Hu Li lunges forward and  Carter, sending him backwards
Put them in the truck
The  pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck
should kill you right now, but 'm gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine, and maybe you can be reformed
The  start towards Carter
He holds up his hands
(') No more hitting
'll get in the truck myself
As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a look of sheer hatred
As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li Carter with her gun
- The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway
- The truck pulls onto a , the  close behind it
-   - and  are in the back with crates filled with
They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows
Carter is flexing his battered body
Are you okay
What's the first thing  told you -- never trust nobody
How could you fall for that shit
knew she was dirty
She saved our lives
For how long
Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides
Lee looks disappointed
(') Look, man 'm sorry
know you got a thing for her
Shhh, my head hurts
'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me
This wasn't my case, Lee
Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central
didn't have to help you
Why did you help me
It doesn't matter
Lee thinks about this for a
'm not used to having a partner
We are not partners
Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating  just took, as far as  can tell all partners get you is dead
Well we're not friends
You got that right
And we ain't brothers
Maybe we should just end this right here
Fine with me
won't talk to you, you don't talk to me
We'll die in peace
See you in the next world
don't believe in reincarnation
So won't see you in the next world
Fine
believe in heaven
You people believe in heaven
Yes
We have heaven
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven
What's a Chinese heaven
thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues
They don't let everybody in
think we should stop talking
Fine by me
(') You thinking about that girl that dumped you
No
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her
Mind your own business
How was the sex
There was no sex
She was very traditional
We were waiting until we were married
You're kidding
No sex
Nothing
No mu-shu
No mu-shu
What about a little king pao chicken
No kung pao chicken
Never
Steamed dumplings
Once in a while, steamed dumplings
But only when she was drunk
That's rough, man
If  don't get steamed dumplings once a week,  go crazy
Tell me the truth, Carter
Do you think have a good voice
Are you serious
Forget it
It doesn't matter
Lee turns away from Carter
As long as you're asking
think you have a pretty good voice
knew it
What does she know
You want me to sing something
That depends
How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head
Go ahead
Sing your ass off
Lee clears his voice
Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world
and if you did, was she crying, crying
hey
- The 18- drives by followed by the
- Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that is driving behind the truck
Hu Li is on the car phone
Don't worry, the plates are safe
Yes, the dragon's been fed
She   and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best to appear completely uninterested
- The  splits off from the 18-
18- -   - Carter works at opening one of the crates
Lee steps up, takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet spot, and  a hole in one of the thick boards
They start prying the crate open
Very nice
It's focus
Every opponent has a weak spot
You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike
'll remember that next time 'm fighting a box
Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with , about $1,000,000 worth
He tosses a stack to Lee
(') Hello, Benjamin
Who's Benjamin
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity
Chinese man discovered electricity
No Chinese man discovered electricity
Yes he did
He also invented the bicycle
Now that  believe
Carter pockets two stacks of superbills
Lee looks at him
(') You never know
Besides,  always wanted to die rich
The truck lurches
We're slowing down
This must be it
End of the line
You've been a good friend, James Carter
Oh no you don't
Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee
'll kick your ass from here to Compton
You could never kick my ass
You mama's boy
Don't you talk about my mama
(winks at Lee) That's more like it
18- - The truck is parked in the underground loading docks
It's approached by
Soldier #1 opens the '   to find
Lee and Carter are gone
Except for boxes of money, the truck bed is
Two soldiers enter the truck bed
Lee and Carter  up against the  of the truck bed
Above the doors and over the soldiers
Lee and Carter   in unison -- knocking both soldiers to the ground
In the next instant: still holding on to the door frame -- swings and backflips onto the roof of the truck
who swings onto the ground -- grabbing one of the guards to use a shield as gunfire erupts
Lee jumps off the truck, knocking the last guard to the ground
He then grabs the guard Carter is using as a shield and together   him into the truck -- the first two guards
Carter and Lee slam the back doors  -- bolting them and run like hell - scrambling into what looks like the closest way out: on the side of the tunnel
- Lee and Carter run through - it extends out from the underground loading docks
This way
see some lights
Lee and Carter spot a tiny sliver of light coming through a They start climbing up the metal stairs that lead up to the street
- The blvd
's packed with  and
Lee and Carter coming up from the manhole -- standing together in stunned disbelief as they look out at the They cover their eyes, blinded by the greatest light show in the world
Vegas
Lee
just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash
They both turn around and come    : -
Fire shoots from its nostrils every 60 - out over the strip as Lee and Carter look up at the
The    :   - '
Lee and Carter come out of the sewer
Red Dragon
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat
Lee and Carter watch as limos pull up to the front of the hotel -- it's like a
The richest of the rich are making their way inside
Let's go
Wait a second
We can't go in like this
Look at this place, we gotta look fly
We gotta Mac out
What is Mac out
Follow me my Asian brother
Carter and Lee start to walk away
(') Just stay down wind, because  think you stepped in some serious rat shit down there
- Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store
- As they enter, a  approaches them
May  help you gentlemen
Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of superbills
Black
42-long

And get my partner something from the children's department
Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder
Would your partner like silk as well personally like it when a couple matches
Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder

thousand years ago, a small, wealthy village in China hired a young Dragon to guard their treasure in a cave, hoping to scare off potential bandits
Their plan worked quite well, until the people of the village started sneaking the Dragon extra food -- hoping to make him bigger and stronger

- Lee walks into the hallway, moving like a cat as he hugs the walls and tries to make his way to the soft count room
He hears noise,    coming behind him through the casino door
He has no choice but to crawl over the back of a money cart and hug the top
He lies as still as he can, trying not to be seen -- until he realizes he's staring directly into the     cameras that are in the ceiling
' as he passes directly under the camera, clearly mouthing the words "oh shit" as he rolls by
Lee looks to his left, sees the    -- a mountain of   that are waiting to be paid out
