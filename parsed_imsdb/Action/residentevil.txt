More than simply an outdoor type, he seems perfectly in place, almost part of the environment
band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles
Sitting on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees
coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through the hilltops
As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes recognizable
Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad
The regal bird lands on a high rock where
unexpectedly
a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above the highest water
Take it, Goliath
It's yours
"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it
(cont
) See ya next year, guy
Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock

Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note
"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down
She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she recoils and climbs again, hovering

The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning
It makes another dive, but stops short again

The bird seems frightened
Of what
It makes one more dive
Gets very close to the fish
but suddenly  and peels, away from the rock
Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair

Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the fish
It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight catches   there
Something that lets out a sharp
Chris whirls around
There's nothing on the rock
Nothing at all
The fish has been taken
' walks into a characterless apartment
He quietly sheds his clothes
Even in silhouette, we can see that his body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight
Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases himself into a bed where
a beautiful young girl,  , seems to be fast asleep
As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her eyes, facing away, are open
Chris gently drapes an arm around her and lets his body relax
( whisper) Glad you're still here, lady It's my apartment
(Surprised) You're awake
've been awake
Since you left
Sorry
His apology goes no further
He's still troubled by what happened in the hills
(cont

something wrong
What, with my dinner

Chris smiles politely
He offers
'll do the cooking

There are probably all kinds of things prowling around up there

Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely

That's what fascinates me
Fascination
Not love
Jill is being playful
Chris, taking her question to heart, becomes introspective

living alone too long
You're the first, the only woman 've ever thought of as
a real partner
Now Jill becomes introspective
've always been

Chris looks into her eyes
She kisses him gently

Beauty may not be simple
But it's not all that complicated, Either
Most of the time, you find It

At least, they never let it show
They kiss again, this time more passionately
Rolling over, they begin to make love
The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite dark when a crusty old farm-hand, , opens the creaking door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads out into the morning breeze
Two dogs,   and  , romp at his heels as Rake opens a log gate

Oh, God, Rake
Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive
Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly reloads the Winchester
Stepping forward, he aims carefully

clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal
It takes Chris a long moment to recover
then, he looks into the trees
The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their remains
They haven't landed yet
Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find
he has died
Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time to mourn
He closes Rake's eyes
Digs through the grass
Pulls up a handful of dirt
Stuffs it into the old man's hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it

His eyes are soft, for the last time, as he tucks Jill's beret into his pack

who's there

Behind him,  Decomposed pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet
It gropes

Chris is unaware of the danger
He  himself against the door
He can't break through
The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once a

He aims his Winchester
He forgot
It's empty
The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor
Chris digs in his shoulder bag
Pulls out a handful of bullets and with them, accidentally, Jill's
Rising emotion stops him for a moment
The dead man crawls toward him
Chris might not have time to load
As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the zombie  at him

Looks at it
Sniffs it
The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers

It drops back into the chamber
with Ridley never knowing why
Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire questions, none of them answered
Who are you
Who are
What the hell is How'd you get in here
Who sealed the door
Who knew there a door
appears suddenly behind Ridley, out the muscle between his shoulder and neck
The trooper stands, stunned, for a moment
Who
who
then he drops
The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully at Chris
wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it calmly chews on Ridley's flesh
Swallowing, it reaches out
Chris grabs its arms,  it into the chamber
Then his Winchester, once, putting a  in the thing's head
Chris slams the door
In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, and the   have heard the new gunfire
Where'd that come from

What he doesn't hear is

Wounds are fresh
But look at his skin

He was dead

Wesker has been exploring the corridor
Stopping in front of the elevator, he shines his light into the car
We expect someone

to be lurking inside
An attack comes from the opposite direction

Not a vegetarian, that's for sure

There was a guy
Not part of the team

Speak English, hombre
Marcus has been experimenting with an artificial

Coded
the ''-virus
Financing came from a private corporation, you may have heard the name
Umbrella
They're
multi-national
Huge
So huge that they have
connections
in high places
That's why we're here
Pg-31 This virus
it jumped, right
Shit
We're all dead
We got the bug, and we're all dead
It's not airborne
It was spread
in the water supply
Lab animals and
the researchers themselves
passed it on

By
biting
Wesker hangs his head
It's an affirmation
You catch this virus and
what
You die
But
not for long
The chemical
revives the brain, and
You stand back up
and chew on the first guy you see
Christ, this is like
Night of the Living Dead
Why, in the name of Jesus, would anybody wanna mess with shit
that does that shit
Victory, friend
Civilization has come a long way, but we still have
war
Imagine
a soldier who can't die
That
was the concept
But the virus
jumped
Hopefully
if we got all the dogs
we've contained it
Hopefully
Jesus
why didn't you tell us
Pg-32 By telling you , 've put your lives in jeopardy
Nobody has this information
Except a few high-and- mightys
Me
And now, you
The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in
(cont
) We have to get Marcus out of here
He developed this thing
He's the only one who
understands it
don't know, this all sounds pretty shaky to me
With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and
at Rebecca
She flinches
The bullet flies past her and  the skull of , the dead trooper who, having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind
Ridley drops
dead again
Guess that proves it
head-shot knocks 'em down
Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body
Th-that man
was dead
(Freaking) 'm a doctor
should know
That man was dead
Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose
hope you have a lot of these
- crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising light from one of the vents
He looks down through the grid work and sees
the same  that was behind Marcus in the opening video
No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart
Files are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of furniture and computer hardware
that line the walls are filled with   making Chris watches a  sip water from a dish
Like the other animals, its skin is rotting
Pg-33 Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches
outside the cages
There's  , in a lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad
(Calling) Hey
: the man's
flaking, decomposing
The pen it holds is making only random, erratic marks
(cont
) The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice
There's  left of his
seeps odd- colored fluids
single eyeball is nested tenuously in the ooze
Something like a mouth, recognizable only because of its position, opens
and
Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears
from below
He looks down again, just as
the lab door  open
and   stream into the lab
The thing with
the destroyed face turns toward the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them
Without hesitation, Wesker, on point,  a quick burst into the thing's brain
It drops like a sack
The lab animals
The team files in, not noticing

heading directly for
Chris shouts (cont
) He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle and
punches a sure-fire  in the zombie's head
, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is being attacked
He  the ceiling with his automatic
Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage, but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through the ceiling panels
Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping the punch holes
He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents and Plexiglas panels
Bullets weaken the framework
It sags
then , dropping away
Chris is plunged into
Pg-34 "" kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting himself, getting his bearings
He's in a huge that's built into one of the laboratory's walls
and he's not alone
There are   in the tank
, their flesh rotting, leaking pus
The largest of them  at Chris, but its jaws catch only a clump of his swirling hair
Chris kicks with his feet, remaining upright, and  his wet Winchester
The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water
It penetrates the shark, but barely
We can see the casing lodged in the animal's flesh
Chris gets an idea
He kicks forward
Plants the barrel of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass
only to find himself aiming directly at
, who is aiming back at him with her -16
They're both stunned
They stare at each other for a moment, like gunfighters, until
another shark circles in for an attack
Chris swings the Winchester away from Jill and  underwater

) Hang on
We're gonna get wet

Chris out
Water  into the lab, knocking Wesker and some of his squad down
They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a dark pool
with   slicing the surface
Everybody opens fire
The dead fish keep coming
Where the fuck is a shark's brain
In it's head
swear, Aiken, you would be better off dead
In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks  their tails, making startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, at the scent of warm flesh
The troopers, hampered by the water,  around wildly, many of them nearly getting bitten
The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from ten spitting automatics
Pg-35 The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with
But thankfully, the level is dropping
The water is seeping out through  in the floor
The sharks become more visible, moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor
The troopers pick them off, one by one
The immediate threat passes
but as the water drains away, the troopers become aware of

Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on his "Game-Boy"

Wesker  his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall
It shatters into bits
Pg-36 That was a smart move
Wesker bristles
He's about to confront Chris, but he spots his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by the water
He walks over and picks them up, wiping the lenses on his shirt
Without looking at Chris, he asks
And
you are
Nobody
Just a

Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook
He takes it down and uses it to dry his rifle

) who gets pissed-off when he finds
his farm animals
and his father's oldest friend
dead
And the only woman he ever cared about turns out to be a goddam
Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up

His name is Chris Redfield
He was

snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher- than-normal stakes
This is not the time to mouth off, Chris
You're in deep shit here
Why didn't you let me in on this
Why did you have to come after me
How did you get in here, anyway
used to play here, when this was a fucking laundry room
And what makes you think  came after
Pg-37 (Interrupting) Whoa
Look here
Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot

Wesker steps in for a look
The greens are the overrides

Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor
He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the bullets dry
(cont
) (Off the screen) We're on level ''
We have to get down to level ''
Hold on
Marcus is dead
If this mission was about bringin' him out, we're outta here, right
wish we were, but no
We have a potential outbreak here
We might be the only ones who can stop it
Pg-38 Stop it
How
There's
an antidote
Everyone's ears perk
(cont
) We can't bring Marcus out, but we can bring out the serum
Maybe somebody
can analyze it
and figure how to beat the virus
Jill looks at Chris
Catches him weighing options
(Privately) Not simple
(Privately) Not complicated, either
We only have to decide
what's right
and what's wrong
(Privately)  forgot
You're never confused
So
what's right, Mohawk
And what's wrong
Shit
(At the computer) There are no green exits on this level
Why
why would that be
They don't want anybody up here to go snoopin'
upstairs or down
Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile
Pretty good guess
You must have been in the military, son
Native American
Exempted
(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck
There
there's no way out
Yes there is
Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium
Pg-39 Wesker looks up
Then looks back at Chris
Not a bad idea
(Turning to Vickers) See if you can call up
service charts, schematics
Brad's fingers fly
He scrolls through menus
Got it
Ceiling grids, ladders
The whole infrastructure
Print it
Print all of it
The young man types a command
Wesker rushes over to the and grabs the first chart that rolls out
Rebecca steps over to Brad
She points at his leg
Seated at the computer, his trousers hiked,  can be seen on his sock, just above his boot
What's that from

snagged it
On the desk
When we were scrambling
Lemme look at it

It's just a scratch
Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts
There's a

It might not show on there
It runs up to the kitchen

Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team

Any objections
The troopers exchange glances
Jill is first to speak
Pg-40 No objections

(Disappointed) You said
people wind you up and you do whatever they want you to do
Stay out of this, son
You're the only one who doesn't have a choice in this
There's no place to lock you up
can't let you go, you're a security risk
could shoot you
Legally
But your lady-friend would probably get all over my ass
So
'm afraid you're comin' with us
whether you like it or not

Before Wesker can stop him, he eats the barrel and  out the back of his head
One zombie is dangerously close
Barry fires two more rounds
No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though not dead,

The colonel rolls on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear
He uses his own pistol to  the zombie
He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps up
The third zombie grabs his legs
From above, Barry risks a dangerous shot

Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris
But he notices Jill watching him

It was a mistake to go into that lab upstairs
My mistake

From now on it's straight ahead

Pg-53 Wesker stands and opens the door
Outside is a with unfinished walls
Spaces between raw metal beams are stuffed with insulation
Wesker checks the jamb outside
It's got a lock mechanism

) Not an override
My key won't work here on the way out
Prop the door
The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open
Wesker moves out
The commandos trickle after him
Chris holds Jill behind for a moment
Jill
this guy is a Loony-Toon
He's just
trying to get the job done
Doing what he has to do
Yeah, well
hope you'll say the same about me
when  do

Chris turns and walks off
Jill follows him out into
the corridor
They catch up with the  which is clustered at a blind alley which has two doors

Decisively, he selects one of the doors and uses his green key card
With a , the lock releases
The troop enters
a vast , fifty-by-fifty yards
It's filled with ,  ,
for the internal computer network line one wall, and   another
This is the systems center for the entire facility
There's an attendant's desk just inside the door and  drag it over to prop the door open
It makes Pg-54 a frightening  as it scrapes the floor, echoing, bouncing around in the large space
It prompts a response
another of those animal-like  from somewhere in the distance
What's that sound like to you
AlKEN meat-eater
There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet
The spaces between them are very dark
It's hard to see
and some of the  click on their
Beams cut through dust
There are
and  emit from the switchers,  from the heaters, all combining to fray everyone's nerves
Light beams dance nervously as the commandos start out across the dark and frightening space
(Softly to Jill) This is the heart of the whole place
They've got to have it
protected somehow
Two things happen, almost at once
First

whirls around to shoot at the zombie, but Chris grabs her and  her on the floor
Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first electric eye

Chris and Jill are barely beneath them
Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams
which do no immediate harm
but wherever they make contact, small above the electric eyes begin to

) ,
The commandos duck under the laser beams
just in time
Jets of  spout from the cylinders
It's not just hot steam
It's , deadly
Marini is hit by it
His clothes
His flesh
It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop
Pg-55 Marini is dead on his feet
When he falls, he trips another of the laser beams
The steam jets  again
The troop is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that spit from the nozzles
Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact
But as it begins to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate the sensors again
There's no way outta this mousetrap
So we live here now
We gotta run for it
The zombie hits one of the laser beams
The steam out again
The zombie is
Bad idea, Speyer
Down
Through these
Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor
Where do they go
Does it matter
Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on the screws that hold down one of the panels
Other troopers do the same
Another  lurches out of the darkness
And
Human hands work furiously, loosening screws
Panels come up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings
second zombie hits a red beam
again
Chris and Jill are spattered
Burned
But Jill bravely keeps working with her own issued knife
She gets a panel open
As she drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam
Chris ducks and covers
When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening, but one of his legs is  from behind by
one of the dead things which has already been
Pg-56 Its flesh is bubbling
Bone is beginning to show
But the acid hasn't reached its brain yet
The creature is still alive
Chris  out
Acid from the zombie's hands is burning his leg
The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a bite of flesh
Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into the zombie's mouth
He's able to hold the thing's head back, but he's stuck
He can't let go
Jill pops up out of the floor
She presses the barrel of her own weapon into the zombie's forehead
On three
One

Chris pulls his rifle away
At the same instant, Jill
The zombie is  through the air
One of its flailing arms triggers another laser beam
Chris throws himself in on top of Jill as   over them
Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid
Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels pressure
on his ear
groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece
For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be popped loose
Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and   into the dead thing's brain
The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in the wire
Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles of the thing's dead hand
cut through bone, removing the fingers from the hand
The wire is freed
Wesker dives into the opening in the floor
The  find themselves in an
No room to stand
Hardly room to sit
Chris looks at his rifle stock
It's corroded from the acid in the zombie's mouth
Jill notices
God
and it doesn't even stop them
Pg-57 It's not meant to stop them
It's meant to stop
something else
That distant   comes again, making Jill shiver
The troop is strung out along the metal shaft crawls among them, treating the worst burns
checks his maps
confronts him again
We damn near got turned into Rice Krispies by that gizmo of yours
If you don't want me to nail that fuckin' thing into your ear, you deactivate it
Right now
can't
They
fixed it
so you can't chicken out
The system can only be turned off at the main panel
Where the hell is that
Where the explosives are
Down
farther than we need to go
We only have to make it down one more level
If
when
we make it back up to the choppers
we can fly out of the detonator's signal range
Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft 'm not willing to rely on that
live here, this is my town
The town's been evacuated
Just
just in case
That explains the lie
About the plane crash
An airplane down
with weapons on board
would nicely explain a big explosion, wouldn't it
You figured all along you might have to blow this place
don't want to do it
hope don't have to
Pg-58 Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's eyes, hidden by distance
and by his dark glasses
(cont
) That's the best  can do for you, kid
Good faith
Now
let's knock on it
Wesker moves out
The troop follows
can't let this happen
've got to find that bomb
'll help
Once Wesker gets what he wants, my obligation is over
Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes
No
want you out
With the rest of them
Wesker won't push the button until you're clear
He doesn't want to push the button
He has to
Don't you see
He can't leave these labs here
And, Jesus
walking corpses
He's gotta get rid of the evidence
The light is dim at its best
Long stretches of the shaft are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that eerily
This whole mission has been like a descent into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down
There are turn-offs, ""s and ""s
At one point, when looks back, she finds  behind her
Chris is gone
Did he leave to deal with the bomb
No, but he's about to
He's at the rear of the pack, pressed against the side-wall, waving others past
Chris, no
've got to try and stop this
Pg-59 Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes
everyone freezes when
the duct-work starts to
Shit
One thing after another
The air shaft is , as if punched by a giant fist
Then
the whole structure begins to

Sit tight

Others do the same
All along the shaft, panels begin to
Something outside is  the duct as if it were a giant tube of toothpaste

But the flesh of
The things that press in through the openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the kitchen
Those were its fingertips
These are its
Strong arms that are  the ductwork apart
Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the shaft
The rest in another
including Jill, who calls out
The section that holds Chris' group
with a monstrous,  sound
'  spills out of the dangling metal, with cables from the torn ceiling
around them
The troopers drop out of Hell, into
An enormous  , a lush, indoor  of , ,
It's like a  , complete with a thick, damp  that makes it difficult to see
We might be on another planet
None of the foliage seems indigenous to Earth
There are  the size of bed sheets,  , the size of armchairs
And at the center of it all, is the mother of the deadly vines
42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal size
Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the facility above
There are also dozens of shorter, beefier "arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on an octopus
and each has a large, drooling  at its tip
Pg-60 from three -16s shatter our ears
and a ceiling

It seems to stretch forever, in both directions
It has no doors, no visible means of exit or entry
The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer , whose irregular shapes fit together like a The floor is  , though faceted
It seem designed to shift
The whole corridor looks like it might be able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way
There are disconcerting signs of damage
claw-like  on the tiles, clean cut  punched through the metal ceiling, larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by bullets
And there are smears of  everywhere, as if some terrible battle
or battles
took place here
This way

) No
That way

If they're dead, they're dead
If they're alive, they'll still be alive in twenty minutes
When we get back
Maybe not
And how do we know it's only going to be twenty minutes
How do we know we'll be able to come back this way
We don't
But we'll do our damndest to try
This is it, guys
The home stretch
Let's go
Wesker trots off
Vickers and Rodriguez follow
Speyer and Barry hang back
with Jill, who remains torn
(cont
) (Looking back) Valentine
You're on the clock
Fall in
Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully, she "falls in"
As the troopers move off, we hear odd
with the high-pitched  of metal-on-metal
Pg-61 The beefy "" of  42 undulate overhead as  and his  look for an exit
Th-this thing was no accident
It was cultivated
And it didn't rip out the ceiling for the fun of it
Stay alert
The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution
The pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing
then pull back
like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals
Chris spots
(cont
) Here
As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in front of , and doesn't withdraw
It hovers there
Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers of cartilage that look like teeth
Inside, a pulsing calyx emits a pistil that twitches and swells
My mother made me eat vegetables

This ain't one of 'em
Aiken
swoops down on Sullivan's back
Its  clamps onto the flesh between his shoulder blades
It's shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within the blink of an eye,  out every ounce of the man's blood
His skin turns the color of , like powder, as he dies

Leaping up, he grabs one of the and pulls it down

Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way
Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but Chris manages to  the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of sprinkler-fed  around the plant's roots

The plant , hideously, as electricity causes fluids to from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms", and into its blood-sucking pods
which , lifeless, to the floor, with the same sort of liquid  that human skulls might make
They

The bastards

Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed  and wildly attacks the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs, not stopping until he cuts into
something that looks like a vine
but
Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's coiled in high tree branches
It's the oversized body
of  , with a belly   in diameter
As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's  from behind
The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the greenhouse, but its head is on the other
With the power of a dozer-shovel
like the open hood of a Cadillac
the size of windows
onto Aiken's mid-section, instantly  his ribs
Chris finds a skein of
He throws the long end over a ceiling beam, then instantly makes a  out of the piece in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head
Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss
Chris throws again
In the seconds between tosses, the snake has  Aiken into its mouth
The rope encircles the beast's head
Chris pulls
The noose slips down over the snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck
Chris uses all his strength
With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the snake's head is  against the rafters
(To Rebecca) Hold this
Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond
Pg-63 (cont
) ,
In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like Wesker
It sobers him
It sobers Rebecca, as well
She rushes in and takes hold of the rope
Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped on the floor
He grabs it, turns back, and sees
something  inside the snake's beaded torso
It's Aiken
still alive
Chris charges,  the knife into the beast, hacking through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody
Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale
His chest has been crushed to half its normal size
Acids from the monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands, his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words
-kill me
-Sullvan said
'd be
better off dead
That
ain't never been truer than now
Kill me
The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the ceiling
Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's , bodily, off the floor
The rope , cut by the steel beam
Rebecca falls
The trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris
It delays the snake for two seconds
Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach into the open belly of the monster
and pull the  on that dangle from Aiken's vest
The giant copperhead  at Chris from behind, missing him by inches
He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a pass
What he catches is
Rebecca's arm
His momentum carries her down to the floor
They roll behind another   that contains tons of earth, which protects them from

the explosions of the grenades
which blow Aiken
and yards of the snake's mid-section
into eternity

They hear the sound

More of the hunters drop from the ceiling
but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact
Run
We slowed 'em down
Run
Where
As far as we'll get, either way, is a cement wall
There are two hunters left on the ceiling
One of them makes a mighty, impossible
and hits Speyer like a battering ram, slashing his   with its claws
Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking, but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains
Pg-68 Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and backs away
He sees
one of those jigsaw tiles, a one,  from within
He thinks he's hallucinating until
the floor , in a tight spasm
Its steel facets begin to separate, sliding away from each other
The troopers narrowly escape as

Speyer's body, and those of the hunters on the floor, are  by the powerful steel blades
But one hunter remains above it all

Mucous from its nostrils spits through
Pg-69 After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes

Everyone relaxes, visibly

It's mounted on a six-foot tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes running out of it
Wesker squints, and through the freeze, sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder
It's nine feet tall
Like the hunters, it has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more defined than Superman's
One of its arms is scaled to size, but the other is much longer
Its hand dangles at knee- level
Monstrous steel  depend from its fingers, nearly touching the floor

Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear

Powerful enough to  that head as if it were

Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this
The Tyrant is not completely free
Much of the cylinder wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound
Though it won1t for much longer
Wesker starts toward the door
Barry grabs the back of his shirt and pitches him across the lab
