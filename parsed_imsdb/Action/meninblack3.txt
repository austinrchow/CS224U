3 Written by Etan Cohen & Lowell Cunningham Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison guards
Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the sneering face of just such a man
We follow the guard Paint peeling off the rusty bars
Somewhere, someone is playing harmonica
Prisoners yell complaints as he passes
He meets them all with-- Shut up, convict
Get yer hands off the bars
The guard passes through several levels of security doors, deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison -- home of the scum of the scum
Meanwhile
The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read magazines, watch
Footsteps -- someone's here
Which pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do their jobs
The unseen visitor buzzes for help
They take their time getting off their asses
When they finally look up, their gaze becomes a leer
Follow it to: , the visitor
Too tall, too muscled, but hot if you're into that kind of thing -- an
Crumb drawing come to life
She holds a  -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook
2 Lookie here
Yaz's visitor guess even a turd gets flies to land on it
3 Me,  like a big girl
2
They smirk, hoping for a reaction
Devil girl emits a low, sinister growl like an angry Doberman
The guards look at each other and    : 2 , visitation papers
He reaches the end of the hallway
The biggest, most absurdly-reinforced double security door
He punches in a code
The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it squeaking and groaning the whole way
Whoever's behind this thing must've done something  bad
Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security wands
The guards are being thorough
Maybe more thorough than they need to be
They check everything -- even the cake
The digital readout tells them
3 She's clean
Well, not , but you know
They laugh, buzz her through
The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the hallway
Stops in front of a cell
Yells in: Hey, Yaz
You got a visitor
Let's go, pretty boy
Spare
Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured concrete
Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face of a guard
The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks like they're not taking chances
3
At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake
She hears the door open -- her face lights up as -- , an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a grubby unshaven face
Everything about him seems strangely independently alive -- every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the way Elvis was in his prime
He wears a distinctive
smirk plays on his mouth that says -- 'm smarter than you, asshole
The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his  and They dump him into one of the chairs
Devil Girl jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long
guard pokes them with his billy club -- 2 This ain't a conjugal visit
quit yer conjugating
When's the last time you conjugated anything
brought you a cake
Thanks, darling
( ) Hey could you cut this up for us
It's our anniversary
'm romantic like that
guard picks up the cake
Smirks and takes a dirty three- fingered scoop of frosting
2 ( ) Not great
She must
be good at somethin' else
They all
He goes back for another scoop
wouldn't do that
2 Why's that, convict
4
: Where he scraped away the frosting, 2 (') -- But in a flash, the mouth   -- -- another springs out behind it -- they consume the guard's entire face
That's why
The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of grotesque   -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as their master, snarling and hungry for blood
The guards draw their weapons, but
-- he launches his aliens, taking them all out
Yaz "holsters" the aliens and
One guard, badly wounded, crawls to In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own weapon
She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of his chains
There's nothing sexier than a girl killing for me
She runs a hand over his bicep
You got so strong in prison
Yaz notices the almost-dead guard: 'm not just a man of brute force, you know
prefer to be known for my rapier wit-- His tongue      -- like a rapier -- impaling the guard-- 5
(') --and tongue
The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl
They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw open the door
Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming, chaos
Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead guards,
He's a sociopathic badass
and she's no slouch either
Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket- Propelled grenade ()
He uses and discards them as he goes
They head for the front gate and
But
They turn the corner and find 50  in    -- Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz
All Yaz has left is his
Give it up, Yaz
There's no way out
beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against the 50 Guards
No one blinking
Prisoners
watching
what's gonna go down
You can't win
You've only got one shot in there
Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it
The guards  in their heavy riot gear
You look hot
Mind if  open a window
6
The guards share a look - huh
Yaz grins, turns his towards the wall behind the guards
The guards' faces go Hey
Whoa
What are you doing
Don't do that
Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are like from a hole blown in an airplane
What the
Yaz steps through the hole
As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep, satisfied breath of
Reveal we are on
The signage on the prison reads , Yaz looks up at the    , smiles
As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes '
they also seem drawn here
Like bees, they express a collective intelligence
'm coming for you
Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into
MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy
Ending on a As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface, where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases

) When you really think about it, the universe is a pretty awful place
Full of danger, brutality, and ten million kinds of scum
So the trick is to find one or two things that make life in this cesspool worth living
And reveal we are actually looking at
Rotating on a spit
and  watch this awful duck rotate
That
That nasty, greasy thing makes your life worth living
There's people eating here, younger than that duck
was talking about the noodles
Best noodles in town
And we are in - ,  - Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish
An eclectic crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or two, a couple of  professor types who love the "authenticity" of this place
flashes a badge to the , Chinese
Good evening, Mr
Wu
(heavily accented, barely ) Kay, Jay
So happy see you
Mr
Wu get you regular table
Not so fast, Wu
We'd like to take a look in the tanks
Yes, you see, very fresh
The tanks in the back, Wu
Oh
so sorry
please no English, you come back later
Hey, save the chop socky bullshit for the locals, Wu
We need to see the kitchen
( ) Why are you busting my balls, Jay
(
) Jay, take a look at this
Wu protests, Jay blows by him
So this is what you're passing off as tuna
Reveal a giant tank holding a
Wow,  didn't think there was anything uglier than a catfish
Jay taps on the glass -- the fish , making Jay
Ugly  a clear violation of Health ordinance 32, selling foodstuffs
That's an earth fish
Very traditional from China
You arrest me, that's hate crime
They turn their stares on him

guess it would be
(grabbing Wu's apron) If you were Chinese
Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the
'mon,  got larvae to feed
And earth fish is so expensive
This is the only way  could stay afloat
Look, Wu
You can serve it to your
out of town guests, but locals get earth fish
earth fish
The kind that doesn't jump out of their stomach and get everyone asking a lot of annoying questions
Like, "Why is my lunch eating Daddy
" You got it
(back to the fish) , that's ugly
Yeah, yeah, thanks guys
Aren't you forgetting something
- Wu walks them to a table, seats them
(for benefit of customers) Allow me most honorable benefit of get you noodles
( ) Be right back, guys
Wu walks off
Jay  the other diners
Something about this strike you as weird
Yeah, look -- clean fork
10
Look at table two over there
They haven't ordered a thing
When's the last time Wu let someone sit at a table without ordering
And table five over there just drank his third cup of duck sauce
Now Kay's radar is up -- Come to think of it
Why is Wu getting our noodles
outside
Because it's about to go down
Wu, at the door, closes the blinds
He catches them looking
Sorry, guys
Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him
The guys reach for their weapons
And    -- It's a -, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it -- The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw various forms of   and It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping truckloads of ordnance at each other
Close hand-to-hand combat
Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not taking any chances
Right ahead of the onslaught,       -- He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, But not for long
An explosive lands between them -- Kay gets     , rolls to a stop in the middle of the Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a motorcycle
As he pulls into the light -- 11
Kay's eyes go wide with recognition
Yaz grins a murderous grin
Some things are worth waiting for
Then come get it, you worthless -- Yaz guns the engine and
Getting the worst of it
messy battle
The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the
And he goes
You probably took that whole catfish thing the wrong way -- The fish    -- lunges and

Because you're so pretty
Jay   -- throwing pots and pans in its mouth, squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it -- (') Kay
Little help

Yaz getting closer
He pulls out a  of a gun, fires into the air
This time you don't have your friends to tell you what happens next
Oh,  know what happens next

Yaz laughs
Gets Kay in his sights
All  wanted was justice, Kay
Justice for my brothers
But you had to meddle, didn't you
They deserved what they got
Why don't you say that to their faces when you see them
Puts the barrel in Kay's face and
Yaz goes up in a
Reveal Jay, just fired the shot
Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of slime and alien guts
He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly pressed
So  was thinking about making a chart for each time  save your ass
And when  do it ten times, you buy me lunch
13
Kay lets out a long, weary sigh
Will you settle for a drink
Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers
Jay is on his phone
( ) We're gonna need a cleanup on the corner of Canal and Mott
And bring a net
Biggest one you've got
Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal
Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles off another table and starts eating
Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the crime scene
(') ( ) Why aren't you eating
( ) So what the hell was that guy
Kay's quiet
Ominously quiet
Weighing his words: Yaz
Put him away a long time ago
Biggest mistake  ever made
Why
Was he the wrong guy
No
Should've killed him
Yeah, well, don't worry,  think took care of him
That was too easy
make it look easy
That's the problem with being my partner
() 14
() You get used to my game
It's what Dr
Phil would call taking for granted
You don't get it, hoss
This guy is different
Worse than anyone
He tried to blow up the Earth but stopped him
He developed a dislike for me and for certain behaviors of mine, such as being alive
'mon, you know better {than anyone
What does an MiB agent call it when 12 alien species try to kill him
Tuesday
Jay laughs at his own joke
Kay just stares
Maybe
(calling off to cleanup ) Make sure you get all of him, mean it
He's an assembler
Yes, sir, Agent Kay
Seriously, man, those noodles'll kill you before he does
got your back
know you do
Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there: (') used to play a game with my daddy
What would you want for your last meal
Could do worse than this
Oh, yeah
used to play a game with my dad, too
Called catch
'd throw the ball, and then it'd hit the house `cause he ' 15
Do me a favor, don't badmouth your old man
Hard to badmouth someone you don't know
( ) Alright, forget it
The past is the past
And right now we have something much more important to talk about
Bowling Night
'm tired
Tired
What -- you afraid 'm gonna take that  trophy away from you
Petrified
See you later
Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back -- (') And slick
Watch yourself
guy like Yaz can come after you when you least expect it
Anywhere, anytime
Jay watches Kay walk away
Looks like he's carrying a heavy load
Turns his attention to the clean up crew: (') What part of clean up everything don't you understand
There's a spleen on that car
On it, sir
glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of
Devil Girl
She reaches down
We see -- a finger with the distinctive Skull, inching its way along the road
You okay, baby
Momma's got you
now

It's the    -- MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk
We see shots of games in progress: An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane, it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins
17
The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow them whole
many-armed alien re-sets the pins
giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul line
and -- gutter ball
He gets mad and shoots the pins with his laser-eyes
We end up with     , '    -- Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia
Where's Kay
We either roll or forfeit -- and  didn't put this on to forfeit
Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for
Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash -shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women

Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor
An awkward beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors
Then a car alarm
(') There goes my perfect game
( ) Ha ha ha
Guess it's on me
Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which
But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a Jay and his teammates triumphant
The frame of a lifetime
Jay looks around -- (') Of course -- the one time Kay isn't here
18
- Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody who did some celebrating last night
We see why -- when he hoists his , Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact
We're number one
In your face
Suck it
Look who's league
Big surprise, you win every year
That's weird
huh
- Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the office
The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash talk
Where are you, Kay
think you want to see this
It's the bowling trophy with  name on it
Jay works his way to his desk
Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay
(') Maybe you want to think twice next time you ditch me
Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer
(') Kay

Yeah,  just wanted to show you this so  could say-- ( ) Who the hell are

How about instead, you go find me guy

Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is (') Killed

Kay wouldn't do that
He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy
He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe

" thought we didn't have any enemies anymore
stranger's just a friend you haven't met
Yeah, that's working out great
Look,  don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but  remember the missile shield --- Kay -- the real Kay -- loved that thing
He wouldn't shut up about it
mean, that thing was all Kay
() But Kay's dead
He's been dead for years
But  knew him yesterday
Jay looks at the  file

Something clicks -- (') () Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere, anytime

So Yaz killed Kay in 1969 and now there's no missile shield

You're definitely not Kay

On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively
Jay runs off with purpose
July in the city
perfect summer day
Kids eat ice cream
Old ladies head to matinees
The streets of New York team with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die
In other words, a Tuesday
Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on blankets
Desperately looking for someone
Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat
As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and
Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays him out
Where you going in such a hurry, Obadiah
The past
What are you talking about
He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a telescope
know you've been time-travelling
No way, man

Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking
Oh, come on, man
Interesting
Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket
Featuring chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire
That's pirated, man
That ain't nothing
Jay rips open his jacket -- And this
Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence
Okay, okay, maybe 've been time travelling a little -- just for personal use, man, just enough to -- Listen -- 'll look the other way if you tell me who's selling time travel these days
just want your supplier
25
No way, man
You don't mess with that guy
He'll kill you, me, and then he'll go after our families
Don't worry, he won't have time
What do you mean
Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles
Those hit the sun in 8 minutes
You want to live out those minutes
Or you want me to take you out of your misery
Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss -- off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head
Okay, okay, but don't say  didn't warn you, man
You just signed your own death warrant
just want a name
Fine, but it's the last one you'll ever hear

Yeah, well, the thing about tomorrow is, we'll all be busy being dead

Help me, or the world is gonna end
Everyone thinks their computer problem is the world coming to an end
Right
Take a look at this
Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky-- Ahhh

That, is We're all dead in
Seven --- Unless
You start sharing the illegal time travel tech you've been slinging

Okay, okay, 'll show you

Yes, but we're running out of time-- Hey

That's it
Jay does it

On the phone -- Now you just type in the year you want to travel to
On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through the phone is the image of the targeted time period
Okay, thanks
Now listen
This is highly crucial: Time travel is nothing to mess with
You can't change anything, you can't use new technology or all of space-time can just -- kablooey

Right
Yeah, that's cool

And the world is vapor
Pure white
Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes focus
Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white environment -- Is this the afterlife
The reverie disrupted by a The white resolves into Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal
The music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s song itself, played over a tinny portable radio
He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of one of the stalls, washes his hands
and flips Jay a quarter
Jay stares at it a beat, confused
Misreading his confusion, the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter
What the heck, you're doing a great job
The kid leaves
Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in
60' White guys on  Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can see -- like the office in the Apartment
Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all
An officious guy, annoyed, runs up-- 30

Watkins' lunch

The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s

(') Wow

You're all dead now
Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses him a set of keys
The Big Man wants his caddy
Chop- chop
The doors close
31
Jay's got the keys
He looks at the parking tag, walks down a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car -- stops and smiles
'  - Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille convertible
Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty
From the seat next to him -- a fedora
He puts it on, completing the look
In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay  and waves -- thank you
Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York
1969  --  ' "Can't Get Next to You" comes on the radio
Jay is swept up in the music and soon is At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian couple
They give him a disapproving look
The woman clutches her pearls just a little more protectively
He smiles and leans towards them
Guess what
Black president
He laughs and drives off
Pulls up at
/ The secret entrance to MiB , familiar from the first movie
Jay strides up to the entrance and
can't open the door
Bangs on the door -- nothing
Shaking the knob, calling to the guard
nothing
From behind him: (
) Help you
Look a little lost
Yeah, thanks, listen-- 32
Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island cops
He instantly realizes what's about to go down
(') () Yeah, guess  knew this wasn't gonna be just people handing me money and Cadillacs
1 'Scuse me
Nothing, officer
'll be on my way
2 That's an awful nice car
Thanks
1 Kind of work you do, individual of your particular
ethnic persuasion
to buy a car like that

1 You an athlete or something
Yeah, 'm the North American champion of kiss my ass
The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner: 1 That sound like resisting arrest to you

If  had a partner 'd know it
There's a simple explanation for that
34
'm all ears
You see 'm your partner
(knows he's about to sound ) In the future
And  came back to save you
longdry stare
Well, thank you very much
- Hey, no problem, man
got you-- Yeah, thought 'd heard them all
Usually, they offer a great gift to the people of Earth in exchange for refuge
Time-travelling partner from the future -- that's some extra-credit right there, and  do appreciate you bringing some much- needed variety to what can be a very dull job
But 'm still gonna have to bring you in
Yeah, ok,  know it sounds a little- It sounds a -- That's why 'm going to prove it to you
Because if  weren't from the future, would  know about -- your little top-secret headquarters right
He tries to force the door open
Nothing
(') said --
(tries - nothing) Jay finally kicks the door open -- And inside
we
35
An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc
(') Right
Not here yet
But it will be
Gonna need to get rid of the raccoons and bats and stuff, but
it'll be real nice
Game room over there for your pinball, you love your pinball
Lotta good times there -- 'm going for an extra ball, Jay
you'd say
And 'd be there
With you
Partners
Long stare from Kay
Let's go
And word of advice -= don't know what it's like on your planet, but around here, a guy with your
complexion in a car like that is gonna get some attention he doesn't want
We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what sounds like ten Harleys at once
Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse
His skull ring gleams on his pinkie
Devil Girl sits behind him, hands on his shoulders
We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway
They     -- even with a brightly-painted microbus full of hippies
One of the hippies leans out -- Hey, you guys like to party
Care to make a trade for the mama
Yaz pulls out his alien "guns
" The stoned hippie smiles serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths
Makes a peace sign
(') Make love, not war
36
Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus -- followed by its brother
The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the inside-out
On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin', don't come a knockin'
The guns, finished, return to Yaz
Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the hippies
But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws it away
The head back on their way
Blood drips over the Ass, Gas or Grass bumper sticker
We dissolve from the blood to a deep red
Widen to reveal we are in
' great  automat
The kind of place you go when you like to be alone
Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own business
Immigrants read foreign papers
Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines offering pies
pastries
, beverages
Is this your favorite place
Makes
sense
Zero human interaction
Kay ignores him
(') So how old are you
Twenty-six
Really
Wow, you got some city miles on you
Jay laughs
Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine offering ""
Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch
37
Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969
(') The fourteenth
Then we have two days
Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich
(') Hey, look,  know your lunch is important, but like  said, we only have two days here
Here we go
Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his selection
Jay reacts to it --
We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever
The meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy
No one in their right mind would buy this sandwich
No way, man
am not letting you eat that
didn't come all the way here to have you die before can tell you-- Kay reaches for the button
Jay slaps his hand away
of undignified hand-slap-fighting-- (') No way, man
No way the world ends because you had to eat that thing-- Kay      and instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are 1969 cloud of smoke
It clears and reveals Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe
It's how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB offices
38
The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking
Aliens run around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes
The alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices
The
liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege
Very male and very white
Women are there to be secretaries and eye candy
Two many-armed aliens stock the automat
Kay tosses one the sandwich, it goes right back into the automat
Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins
Hey
[long alien name] and Bob
Don't worry, you guys get a big promotion in, like, 20 years
Kay takes Jay down an escalator
Quick atmospheric establishing shots of MiB '69: -  wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the times: Castro
Yoko
Hendrix
-  cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high-tech camera
Reveal they're using it to watch a secretary's ass
She gets wise, turns -- they raise their martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible
- Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool
- Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go clean something up
- An MiB barbershop quartet practices
() The men in blaaaaaaack
Jay can't help laughing -- What planet are they from
The Hamptons
Let's go somewhere we can talk
Finally
39
Typical interrogation room table in the middle
Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns stacked together
He fits sheets of carbon between the pages
Oh, we're gonna do the forms now
Listen, Kay,  know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but we're burning time here
When  got here, you had 48 hours
Now you've got 46
Name, planet of origin and Galactic -- My name is Agent Jay, you gave it to me
() "Subject uncooperative
" Purpose of visit
To save the Earth
Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check: "Create a new race
Steal Earth women
Offer life of eternal youth
vacation
Save the Earth
" He checks the box
Save the Earth
Congratulations, you're the third one today
Maybe you'll get a balloon
Fine, don't believe me
But just listen to what  have to say, because it's going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy
It hangs in the air
Are you currently pregnant or preparing to spawn
40
There's a killer out there
Goes by "Yaz
" He's coming for you
You told me your one regret was not killing him when you had the chance
Never heard of any Yaz
You will
Here's what to look for
Long hair, leather, looks kind of like a biker
You'll know him from the skull ring on his pinky
He's trying to blow up the Earth and you get in his way somehow so he kills you
This Friday
In Florida
So, if you want to live -- do not go to Florida
Florida
hate Florida
hate everything South of Virginia
If that's what you came to tell me, you're wasting your time
Man, you're as stubborn as you always were
mean -- always will be
Look, It's not just about you
Because he kills you, you don't live long enough to build the defense shield
And without a defense shield, the Earth gets destroyed
You get it
He kills you, the Earth gets destroyed have to save you from him so we can save the planet
Kay stops writing
Huh
Well
This is finally starting to make sense
Jay looks hopeful
(') Because you're crazy
Paranoia
Delusions of self-importance-- -- 41
Agent Kay
Door   -- in walks
and it sure isn't
, flanked by junior agent underlings
is a well- tanned WASPy jackass with a room-temperature  who probably got this job from his daddy's country club connections
He's good at tennis and not thrilled about this whole "civil rights" fad
Kay stands
Hey, chief
Heard you got a mooner in here
Don't take all day
We're not here to babysit them, just figure out where he's from and send him back
Actually, still trying to sort it out
He says he's human
Fortunately, we have the technology here to test for that
Ex steps up close to Jay
Looks him over
Then (') Gag reflex
Coughing
Eyes watering
Human
Code 43 him
Got it, chief
Kay walks Jay
So what's code 43
They pass through a set of double doors
Tilt up to reveal: 43 42
Jay reacts to whatever he's looking at
-- This little baby here is called a Neuralizer
-- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room
And we 43 -- It's manned by 60s labcoat technicians with sliderules and punchcards
The Neuralizer itself is a piece of 60s-tech-glory -- magnets, tubes, things that look like they belong in Dr
Frankenstein's lab
Whoa, whoa, what
You're gonna neuralize
You can't neuralize me
Haven't you been listening
Two   grab Jay
Have a lay down, stretch
The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69 Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like for an
You erase what's in here, you erase the whole world
Don't worry
When it's over, you'll forget all about this Yaz and Florida and the end of the world
think it'll be good for you
Calm you down
don't need to calm down
43
Don't worry, it's safe
We even tested it on one of our own men
Kay indicates , who wanders around like he's been lobotomized
(') Hey, Agent
waves back: Hey, agent
No, ' -- forget it
(back to Jay) We're still
, fine-tuning it
okay, strap him down
-   force Jay down
flips the machine  -- Jay struggles as he gets closer and closer to the machine
Jay manages to slide his key fob out of his'pocket -- uses the edge to flip open the clamp on the straps -- and ' How the hell-- Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid
The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out
The scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide
It's down to Jay and Kay
Nice moves
You'd make a good agent
a good agent
Kay takes a  at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily
(') That's right, you always lead with your left
44
Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer -- now Kay can't shoot
You're just making it worse for yourself
The following plays over a game of    around the giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks in a library
(') There's nowhere to run, slim
It's just if we're gonna do it easy or do it hard
Jay runs into a dead end
Kay and the orderlies are on him
The pissed-off orderlies grab him roughly, force him onto the gurney
Jay keeps flailing
know you, Kay,  can prove it
() You love to bowl
Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95 million people in more than 90 countries
You gotta do better than that
You've got a scar on the back of your right hand
Jay grabs Kay's hand
They   for a moment
Kay lets Jay flip his hand over, big build-up,
no scar
(') Damn
You will
swear
Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up
And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine
This is all about to be over
Jay thinks desperately for a way out, -- Eureka
(') Kay
What about your girl on Martha's Vineyard
45
Kay looks up
Jay sees an opening: (') You chose the job over her -- but you never stopped thinking about her
You can't forget her
Kay grabs him
How the hell do you know that
've never told anyone that
long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he shouldn't
And he hits the
But this being   -- we stay with ' -- as he slides through the claustrophobic Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time, inches away from him
Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken
You see, Kay
It's me-- But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him-- If you're gonna drag her into this, you'd better be able to back up your story
Because if you're jerking me around, 'll make a window out of your head
Yeah, okay, um -- according to the file, he should have entered Earth- space in the last couple days
Did you spot any unauthorized landings in the last 48 hours
Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard -- We did have something -- a landing in New Jersey
Kay and Jay look at each other
46
( ) Alright, you're coming with me
Jay grabs his key chain
Can  ask how you're planning on getting me out of here
1969 Kay leads a "" Jay through
'Scuse me, boys
Just did a code 43 on this one
How's it going, fellas
Look, put on my pants
He feels one of the agent's faces
Kay leads him to the exit
He talks to Jay as if Jay is a dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English: You are a tourist from Kansas city slicker took your wallet at the bus station
Kay leads Jay to a     " to " -- (') Two out
The agents nod to Kay and   -
Which deposits them in
The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square
creepy pervert sits in a booth
Puts money into the machine
The wall   -- and to his surprise, instead of a peepshow
47
Jay and Kay climb out
Off the creep's reaction: Aww
Did  spoil the mood
- On the New Jersey State Parkway -- You'd better not be wasting my time- Yeah, yeah
Window out of my head
But hey -- if  don't save you, 'm dead anyway
So do what you want to me -- just make sure you watch out for yourself
They pull up to
- squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a "legitimate local business
" The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside
Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all showing disturbing spore growth
[please see http://www

com/watch
v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference] The corpses  and disappear
This doesn't look like a mob hit
That's a hell of an observation
What gave it away
Spores
Dematerializing corpses
And
Jay points beyond the building
a Which is the edge of a    -- And how did this crater get here
48
In the center, a  , all chrome and Flash Gordon
It formed the crater on landing
We're going in
Kay draws his weapon
Aren't you gonna give me a
gun
Right
He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands it over
(') Try not to get in my way
You try not to get in  way
Jay and Kay move towards the building
Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover
More  -- Jay gives Kay  , What the hell is that
Stay behind me
You need to stay alive
The hell  will
Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first
Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because they're squabbling over who's first -- Then -
49
Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head, firing randomly
Kay gets  -- They dive for cover
Kay's right hand is bleeding
Huh
So that's how you got the scar
Jay tosses his   into the corner -- the guy under the desk fires   -
Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified, quivering
Jay grabs him and
The guy is
[ ] What'd he look like
[] Pull it together
Jay
(') The guy who did this --- what'd he look like
Looked like a biker
And he had a
He had a skull ring
Jay and Kay share a look
That's him
Walking up to Kay's car
In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket -- "Rocket Waste Disposal", techs take samples
50
What about the witness
We don't have time to take him back to  to -- We've got something new
Portable Neuralizer
With a rumbling and   , 18-wheelers drive up, housing the "portable" Neuralizer
(') Can you believe how small these things are getting
Yeah
Okay, slick
'm making a decision to believe you
Not because  do, but because  have to, you get me
He walks to the trunk, pops it open
He flips a switch, revealing a
He grabs a   and gives it to Jay
Jay admires the Aw, this means you like me, doesn't it
Let's go get this sunovabitch
They climb in but --
Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them
Out pops an -- Kay
Don't move a goddamn muscle
have you on 12 protocol violations
Kay looks to Jay
Make it thirteen
He   --
51
' Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into - Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff  no-, no- time for anyone
Exact change only
Can you help a stranger, please
Oh, sure
That's what 'm here for
You see that thing behind you
That's New Jersey
Go home and get some change
There's been a great injustice in the Universe
must make it right
You know what's also a great injustice
Sitting in this box all day listening to people try to get out of paying the toll
Let me ease your pain
On Yaz's evil grin
Now tell me everything you know about this Yaz scumbag
In two days he's gonna kill you in Florida
Two days
Doesn't give me a lot of time
You couldn't have come back a week ago
52
Sorry,  was distracted by the Earth blowing up
So we have two days to kill him before he kills me
Alright, there's one cesspool everyone washes up in sooner or later
Someone'll know something there
Come on
Let's take a drive to Alien Town
Alien Town
They drive under a sign indicating: Cruising through
Devil Girl on the seat behind him
He pulls even with a patrol car
Excuse me, officers of the law
Like you,  care a great deal
about justice and 'm looking for some people
Maybe you can help me
Okay -- get a shave and a haircut
They laugh
Yaz smiles sadly
Have you ever lost someone close to you
have
've lost everyone
Everyone except them
Can you help me find them
He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions
The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows
Only one part of town where people like that hang out
53
The historic Village landmark
Jay and Kay approach
60s freaks eyeball the squares
Jay and Kay ride to the sixth floor
There's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz
What cases are you working on
Well, 'got this whole dry ice thing
Dry ice
What's that
Someone get killed over some dry ice
Smuggling something in some dry ice
No
We just can't figure out what it is
Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you
The great Kay, looking for dry ice
Don't push your luck
The doors open, and we're in
- 60' Kay's on the hunt for someone
They weave their way through the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party conversations
Someone notices Jay's suit -- What are you, a time traveller
-- 54
(') That suit is  five years ago
Kay sees who he's looking for, grabs him: We need to talk
Reveal   -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties
Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his "stars
" Yum, pigs are getting cute
Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out
(') meant the young one
Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien -- affect
It's not really a good time to talk
'm creating a party
(sighs, totally put out) But
Maybe if he asks me
What - me
would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth
Jay is visibly uncomfortable
Kay nudges Jay - do it
[Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner]
(then, to Warhol) We need to talk
Please
Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay
Someone snaps a picture
Amazing, just amazing
Alright, you talked me into it
Follow me
() 55 (') ( ) Be back soon, stars
From here, a window looks out over the whole scene
Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and
Immediately, his    -- he rips off his , lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop
Damnit, Kay, are you  to blow my cover
Take it easy agent , your cover is perfectly safe
Perfectly safe
Are you out of your goddamned mind
It's only a matter of time before they figure out 'm a total fraud
Cool your jets-- 'm so out of ideas 'm painting bananas and soup cans for chrissakes
How long do you really think they're gonna keep buying this shit
Warhol slumps on a chair
(') can't take it anymore
Talking to these nutjobs and all these goddamn hippies
God,  hate hippies
They're just filthy, Kay
Yeah,  know they are, buddy
But you're doing good work here
We need you
knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character -- 56
'll be right there
'm just
filming these men eating a hamburger
It's
transcendent
Okay, now the pickle
(back to cop form) You see what  mean
And who the hell's this guy
New partner
Actually, 'm his old partner came from the future to warn him -- Jesus, fine, don't tell me
Alright, what do you need
We're looking for a recent arrival
Long hair, wears a lot of leather
Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description
You'll have to do better than that
Look, if that's all you have, can't help you
Maybe you know someone who's seen something
(
) Andy, the horse is here
gotta get back in there-- Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world
'mon, what's new
What does an MiE call it when someone tries to destroy the world
Tuesday
thought you made that up
57
'mon, ,  got a feeling on this one
Like we should take it serious
And we don't have much time
Jay checks his watch
33 hours
Yeah, yeah, alright
() Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal
'mon
- in very 60s fashion with incredibly giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon hairdo
(
) (back in "character") Vidal, Prell, can you please talk to these nice men
The women's  '  -- they respond in incongruously : Whadaya want
They look like cops to me
ain't talking
We're not rats
We swing around them to  that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not talking to the women's faces -- They're     --    - ' which we realize are two   ,  and , perched atop these women
Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor
58
Ah, you don't scare me
Yeah
Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray
You wouldn't
He sprays the hair, it starts to
Stop, you bastard
'm telling you, we don't know anything
You wanna play tough
How about we take a ride to the barber college, see how tough you are
Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted
On Jay
something is making him think
sound
it
grows louder
we start to be able to make out the distinct bip
bip
bip
of Jay
To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest freaks
They surround a   -- and whatever they're watching on  is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of God
It's too beautiful
Someone takes a picture of the screen
Jay walks around the  -- : They're watching   70S
59
The   controls it via a   hooked up to the  antennae terminals
He's playing against a young clean-cut square
Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game
Everyone  him
, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on
What the hell, man
Just wondering where you got that
Your mother
The crowd laughs
Really
So my mother gave you a technology that hasn't been Jay grabs him by the throat
Partygoers react
Someone takes pictures
Someone claps in delight
(') Now how about you tell me where you really got it
The skanky guy knows he's in trouble
Oh
uh
okay, no hassles, man
got it from that dude over there
With the beard
Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins And the Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest
60
Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their way
To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in incredible shape
It gets competitive between them
Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off
Kay runs the Skanky Guy down - Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion
Alright, one more time
Where'd you get this
It was a gift-- Bullshit
Kay puts a gun on him
(') Oh, hey
This is my partner
He's about to get fired for excessive violence and he doesn't have much left to lose
borrowed it
Kay cocks the gun
(' stole it, okay
That's what  like
nice, honest thief
Stole it from who
They don't even care, man
They leave their money everywhere
Who
don't know who they are-- 61
Then you're not worth much to us, are you
The gun comes back out
heard they were Archanans
Archanans
They're pretty far out of their neighborhood
didn't think we'd ever had one on Earth before
can tell you where they live
Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue Top floor
Apartment 12
Jay rips the medallion off his neck
(') Ow
'll do a lot worse
Get the hell out of here
The guy runs off
What's the deal with the necklace
You were wearing one just like it when you died
Come on
3RD Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building
That address
It's familiar
He pulls out a notebook
(') was going to come by here tomorrow to check out a lead on the dry ice case
62
So you come here tomorrow, get tangled up with these Archanans
And
And Yaz kills me
Something like that
So do me and the people of Earth a favor and be careful
Aw, put on your big girl panties and let's go
Hey, 've always got my big girl panties on
Huh
That didn't sound right
Jay and Kay ride up
That thing back at the party, what was it
Some kind of game
Not just any game,
Game of kings
But it wasn't invented until 1974
How do you know that
Because  was the only kid on my block who didn't have one
Aw, what's the matter
Daddy didn't buy you the toy you wanted
Didn't have a daddy to not buy me toys
Here's the only thing  ever got from him-- He holds up his key chain
63
That's rough
It gets worse
You're the closest thing  have to a dad
Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble
They get to the door -- Apartment 12
Jay points to the door --
They see --     , And punched into the door -- That's from Yaz's ring
He was here
Or is here
Jay Why do you keep doing that
They move into the room on high alert
But it's empty
They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology (including a  hooked up to something strange with tons of wires hanging out) and lots of money
of money
Not just piles -- the actual furniture is They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins
So Yaz was never after you
he was after the Archanans
You just got in the way
Which must make them damn important
But what does he want with them
64
'No sign of struggle
They must've cleared out before he got here
Like they knew he was coming
And he's probably on their trail now
But where the hell did they go
They look around, puzzling over this place
Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money
Think this might tell us something
On the $100 bill: strange series of words and numbers: 3 2
5 1
7 5
Looks like some kind of code
We'll take it to , run it through the computer
Figure out where they went
Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway -- Yaz steps out of the shadows -- Jay and Kay head back to
Kay drives, Jay stares at the $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over -- How about bible verses
Coordinates
Airplane flights
Shoe sizes
So this is how you do it in the future, huh
You just keep guessing until you figure it out
() Phone numbers
They stop at a light
65
Suddenly --
Someone   on the trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume -- hotpants, mary janes, halter top
There's something familiar about her face
For God's sake
Help me, would you
There's some maniac after me - Slow down -- who's after you
He was like nothing  ever saw -- crazy eyes, and this freaky skull ring
Jay and Kay look at each other: Get in
Thank you so much
This is a dangerous city for a girl
The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face
Jay and Kay looking straight ahead
So where can we take you
Just make a left up here
Kay does it
There's a rushing noise
In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl  "" The car turns down a dark, deserted alley
Are you sure
Seems dangerous
Not for me
Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form --
The outfit is grotesque on her
66
in the car
Employing cool MiB tech built into the car
Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a " " -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into
The fight's over, the guys slump against the car
What the hell was that
don't know, but 'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her
Beat
Light bulb moment for Jay -- Say that again
think Yaz sent her
No, the whole thing
'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her
On Jay, realizing-- He grabs the $100 bill -- know where they are
Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering,  we -- How are we going to find them
Any idea what an Archanan looks like
And then -- they see -- , ,
67
circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful, playful, dressed in robes
They could only be -- the Archanans
The group comprises one older Archanan -- the  -- and three younger
think  found them
They step into ' Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of the crowd melts away
Deflected
There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one -- In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings
All is peaceful within this space
Faint chimes
They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra: () King Lady Big Trouble Classy
The faint sound of an announcer: (
0
) Results for the sixth race: King, Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red Gent
() Superba pays 3200 to one
You're in danger-- You're in danger
you're in danger
Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids: Very cute, but-- 68
In eight seconds, please do us the kindness of ducking
Huh
Yaz
They turn to see  -- he levels a    --
Jay and Kay  -- the weapon just misses
Thanks
Let's get into trouble
Jay and Kay engage him -- As they run off, the Lama calls -- Remember, please, to take the bridge
And we begin Try to include motorcycle and horse elements
Could also involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by
At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember
Take the bridge
They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz
At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz   -- Jay is knocked down
Looks
But he shakes it off reveal the  medallion blocked the shot
Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into
a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck
The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck
The truck drives off
69
He's gone
Only a matter of time before he comes back
And this time he might be really mad
Jay and Kay return to an
It's like a ghost town
No Archanans to be found
Damn, we lost them
They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about-- Then, faintly
a Hold that thought
They follow it out to Which is empty
No spectators, no horses
Just the Archanans
Who stand near the track watching
nothing
And yet -- They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race ever
Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell
" Look and approach them
Everybody
Everybody is everybody
70
Yeah
guess  can't argue with that
So listen up -- Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers
First of all-- The Archanans
Jay shakes it off
(') The Archanans
(') What are you cheering about
The races
Jay and Kay keep approaching
Puzzled -- the track is empty
What races
Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura
and now-- The empty stands are (') Where are we
We are tomorrow
Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost town
Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race
From the Archanans'  -- we see  / The effect is --
You
can see the future
It is what you call the future
71
Ah, the future
An illusion of the time-bound, borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another
Yaz suffers from this greatly
And so he must have revenge on your planet
Revenge
, For what
He mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were
Just not now
Okay, someday you're gonna explain that to me, but right now you need to stop the riddles because there's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you
So help me out
need to know   why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the Earth
We know what he will know
You know what
he will know
(figuring it out) You know his plans
() And you're going to stop him
He wants to kill you because you stop him
() Yes, if he does not kill us first
Don't you know if he's going to
Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he does not
There are many futures
72
Okay, which future is the one where you live and the Earth doesn't blow up
The one where you take us home
Jay and Kay exchange a look -- Alright, let's get these freaks home, and pronto
You must let go of your
attachment to time, beginning with your concept of "pronto
" And on that --    -- 12 Blacked-out helicopters
(
0
) () Illegal aliens -- you are surrounded
Do not attempt to flee
Jay and Kay       : No
We need to get them home
But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust
MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them
Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere
MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans-- (
0
) () Agent Kay
Return to your vehicle
Rendezvous at headquarters in 20 minutes
We will escort you by air
And from the noise and chaos of the choppers
To silence
73
- Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall
Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a table
Ex paces, clearly talking  the Archanans to the other agents
Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus
Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up
Ex notices Jay for the first time -- What's he doing here
Didn't we just bust you
That was someone else
All these mooners look alike, right
beat -- and Ex buys it completely
Yeah
So look
We've talked about it
And you are to be commended, Agent Kay
You did a fine job bringing these illegals in
Now it's our job to get them out of the city for containment
Somewhere where if someone decides to blow them off the map, the collateral damage will be insignificant
Toronto
But they're in danger
One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them-- (looks to Jay) And if that happens, we're all going with them, because they're our only hope of survival
Christ, if we listened to every Mooner who showed up telling us how they were gonna save the world, that's all we'd do
Do you know why Earth is still standing
() 74
(') Why we're not a smoldering chunk of nothing
Because we don't stick our nose into other people's business
Especially people in danger, because they have enemies, and those enemies destroy Earth
Now
Are you going to execute my order or not
() thought we were supposed to be the good guys
Careful, Agent Kay
That sounds like insubordination
Kay walks up to Ex, looks him It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see
That's it
You're off this case
Stick to dry ice
If  catch you near them -- or him -- again, 'll have your badge
(to a bunch of other ) You four -- take the Archanans to transpo
One of the agents looks up-- Me
'm just an accountant--- Go
( ) And you
You just get out of here
The MiB agents  the Archanans and hustle them out
Kay leans in to them-- Don't worry, we'll-- 75
Yes, we know
Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him
What
knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down
So what's the plan
You heard the man
We've got dry ice to investigate
It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz
We follow it to the Where the truck dumps its load
Including
Who gets
On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into its natural shape
Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of something, disturbed
We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back together, but     -- a leg stuck in the wrong place, the head at a weird angle
He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself
Pops out an eye, swaps an arm
He unfurls his tongue, smells the air -- Where did you go
76
is suprised to see not just an agent
but four agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his peep show window
One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him: () You will die alone
Yeah,  know
The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest emporium of sleaze
The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off -- We find a     ,    -- Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress
We see -- it's the line to an
And the line isn't moving because -
rises from the freezer: Just a few more questions about dry ice and 'll be out of your hair
makes Kay turn --
he sees Jay waving him over, pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans into the Station
told you ten times --  got no idea what dry ice is
(not listening)
Thanks, you've been very helpful
Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the Vendor scratching his head
He turns back to the kids
Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside
77
The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot
Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant
They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner -- And it's just some Hare Krishnas
Damn
Wrong freaks
But Jay spots the Archanans
Over there, Kay
As they run off -- Perhaps you'd like to join us for a vegetarian meal
Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans -- The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs warning
The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through a   marked " " or " " Jay and Kay follow
Through the skinny half-painted door
An    descends 100s of feet problem: it's going the   -- bringing incognito aliens and MiB agents
Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me -- pardon me -- hey, don't grab that
But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we reveal

It's basically a series of    --people- sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere in banks, offices, etc

Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed aliens

On your 2 o'clock
They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans
They're about to load them into the tubes -- Jay and Kay approach: Hold up
You're off this case, Kay
2 Yeah, but  heard there's some dry ice in Queens
Magic show at a kid's birthday party
Better hustle, you can get there before
the cake
They all  at Kay
Change in plans
What
We didn't hear about any change in plans
79
Yeah, Ex just gave us the new orders -- check this out -- Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his jacket pocket
The MiBers lean in
And Kay The MiB agents stumble, surprised -- The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the MiBers    into the tube
Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize
One last agent is still standing there, wide-eyed: Don't hurt me
'm just the accountant
He reaches for his radio
Jay talks him down: know you're a little freaked out and you want to call for backup, but listen: When you've done this job for a while, you realize there's one rule -- things aren't what they seem
These are innocent beings that need our protection
Are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in Toronto
The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio
(') Good, good
What's your name
Agent Zed, sir
You're gonna be okay, kid
Jay can't help laughing -- 80
He's gonna be better than
'm not gonna give you so much shit anymore
The radio  -- (

Detainees are on the tube to Toronto
No sign of Kay

Zed crosses off
Be nice to him
Trust me
Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup
(') Okay, you all wanted to go home
Well here we are
So how do you want to get off this rock
You guys have the spaceport on Long Island yet
Kay just looks at him
(') That place is a dump anyway
Best Margaritas in the Universe, my ass
What about the one in Ohio
The Archanans smile
Here is the way home
The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants
The attendant bows, and
it passes through all the attendants and then to
Jay gives it a look
Here, huh
You're sure
81
The only future that ends with life begins there
'll take that as a strong "yes
" Okay, then
Follow me
Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal
Kay catches up -- Where are we going
Jay looks at him a beat
Omaha
And 'm gonna buy you the biggest -bone you ever saw when we get there
So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and 'm gonna help these guys over here for a second
But 'll meet you in a minute
By the Omaha tube
They stare at each other -- Sounds good
See you there
Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card -- (') Omaha, my ass
Kay looks at the card:     -- a tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches
(') Let's go
No, no, no
No way
Florida, Kay
That's what it says
Don't you get it
Yeah, it's hot and muggy
The old people drive slow
() 82
(') We'll stay somewhere air- conditioned and only drive after three when they're at dinner
This is why you were there
In Florida
Because of them
You were helping them and that's why
that's why you get killed
Today, July 16
saw the report myself
Agent Kay, dead at the scene
Killed by Yaz
You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death
Besides  got you to watch my back, right
They walk to the just want you to know, 'm doing this out of love, man
Doing what
He gets his answer -- Jay
You stay home and stay alive
But Kay isn't down
told them 'd help them -- 'm honor-bound to do it
Kay throws a  - to Jay's kidney
Jay recovers and throws an  to Kay's solar plexus
Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard
Damn, you used to have some abs
They continue to pound each other
As they trade punches: (') can't let you go to Florida
make my own future
Besides -- 'm younger and stronger than you
83
They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time -- feet collide
Bet you're sorry you taught me that
The fight continues
They're wearing down, circling each other
And then Kay fakes a left --- (') You always lead with your-- But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down hard
Had enough yet
On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor
can't let you go --  love you
Jay
Kay
They
it's a stalemate
Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you- 'm not falling for that
'm not kidding -- Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see
The  -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run
Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of pneumatic tubes
84
The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy, moving gracefully, like fish through water
Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air luge"
Jay is  and ricocheting off the sides of the tube like a pinball
They shoot , passing landmarks of the Eastern seaboard
Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff astronauts in a -Force simulator
Jay  towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe: (yelling over the wind ) have to know -- can  really prevent Kay's murder
Yes
Oh
Okay, then
Thanks, good to hear
But where there was death, there will be death
What does that mean
The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current
Jay gets by a bend in the tube

The huge crowd, the security, the press -Minus 30 minutes
Okay
So we've got
30 minutes to get past security

all washed and ready to- Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck
Move and it's the last thing you do
The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down

Someone is approaching
Someone who walks like they mean business
(') Lt
Colonel
Here are the intruders, sir
Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American
Jay grins, relieved -- Finally, someone  can talk to-- But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal- opportunity hardass to the extreme: The only thing we're gonna talk about is what specific breed of dumbass you have to be to try to penetrate my launch site
He begins patting Jay down
Eyes widen -- Weapon
You are going away for a long time
(to his men) Get them into holding
We'll interrogate them after the launch

and Jay goes for it: Sir, before you do that --- my name is Agent Jay
appreciate your position, but 'm from a top-secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now, on behalf of the people of Earth,
: need to commandeer your rocket so -- (points to Archanans) --can board it
Can we count on your help
The Colonel stares at him for a beat
89
So you want us to stop the most massive endeavor in American history, an event being watched by the entire world, the moment that will be the culmination of a challenge put to us by President John
Kennedy himself
so a bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a joy ride
Would it help if  told you 'm from the future
Get them out of here
He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group
But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm-- (') Hey
--and
On  ' face
He sees something The Lama releases him
The officer is stunned for a moment
Blinks back into focus and turns to the other guards -- (') You men are no longer needed here
Report to delta gate
Sir
Go
Yes, sir
The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans: The rest of you, come with me
The Colonel heads into the building

Things change when you can see the future, right
They sure do
This is definitely about some next-level shit

Hey
You in the glasses

25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn

) Agent Jay
Over here
They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation
(') This is your man
The guys approach the Engineer -- You see this card
The rocket's flight path is all on cards just like this one
Right here -- He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine, that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a processor
An Archanan approaches and     -- it hits the cards like a mini-whirlwind
The cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're magically re-programmed
And fly back into the rack
The engineers are

What a waste
Raquel Welch was here
Five minutes to get to the rocket
And keep your eyes open for Yaz
They head out
: 94
With only a few minutes to go, service trucks -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc
, Driving to get a safe distance away from the blast
The all As one car cuts through them    , parting the waters -- it's a military jeep --   at the wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on
: -- The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the rocket
The only car
Looking up at that rocket
On  , practicing: () That's one little step that  did, one big step for the rest of you
Wait, that's not it
Did that sound weird to you guys
The driver What in Sam Hill is going on
Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting them off
No disrespect meant, [major]
'm a big fan
(Especially of the haircut
) But we've got some bigger fish to fry
Hand over the flight suits
They start pulling the astronauts off the truck
The astronauts protest
(') Let's go, people
Why don't you take one giant leap out of there
95
They look at Jay and Kay
at the Colonel
That's right, gentlemen
You need to listen to them
We're going to protocol twelve
The astronauts acquiesce
didn't want to get in that death trap anyways
'm still getting my parade, right
: The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty
They hear something -- they draw weapons -- And it's Yaz
Still looking like evil incarnate
The guards take in this unholy picture
-- want in
The guards look at each other -- Should we radio the Colonel
(') You wanna get yelled at again
They wave him by
(') Go ahead
Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule
, Technicians in clean suits assist
96
Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all possible threats
Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go
Kay works'with the Archanans-- We good yet, Kay
don't like being out here in the open -- too many ways for Yaz to get to you
'm almost there
Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch
(') Hey, tech guys -- get back here and help me with the door
It's called-a hatch
Whatever, just get over here
Oh, come on -- what's going on
This door is complicated
Oh, for
What
It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant,
It's complicated
Jay goes over to help Kay with the door
They both fuss and fight over the door
Lift it
You have to lift it
No,  am lifting it
You have to hold the lever
97
No, if  hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't
go in the thing where the thingie goes
Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass
Jay
Why do you think a highly trained  technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped
They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant
Because it's about to go down
They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's
: Welcome to the good stuff From here, we launch into a    that will take us up and around the Apollo Rocket
As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high- stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans
We will pay off that  , bentonDESTROYINGTHE to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand bubonic plague
The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen spewing from the rocket
All on top of a rocket taller than a 30-story skyscraper
With -minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against the lunar capsule
: Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay
You can't stop me
Nothing on Earth can stop me
Nothing now
Yaz raises an eyebrow
98
Jay draws his   -- the gun he brought from the future
What's that
Little something  brought with me
Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just  -- As the clock ticks down to -minus 5

Try it
You wouldn't dare
One false shot and you'll rip space and time
That's a chance 'll have to take
Jay Yaz stumbles
The hatch  him in
Just as the   -- - - Uh oh -- But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them
And then it's over
As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off
We did it, partner
hope you remember this when you recruit me -- you won't give me such a hard time
You know  will
Yeah
99
guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something
Jay realizes -- grabs Kay -- Do a better job this time,
That needs to be one hell of a prison
You don't want that guy coming back, or 'm coming back
Look, once was enough,
Jay turns to The Colonel -- (') Thank you for your help, sir
Hope we don't get you fired
Not too worried about that
Can  ask you -- what did the Lama show you in there that made you help us
Was it the Earth being destroyed
No -- it was my son
All grown up
As a matter of fact, 'm late to see him --  promised 'd watch the launch with him
Oh
Thanks
He's a lucky kid
'm a lucky dad
Take care
Jay offers him a handshake
The officer takes it -- and pulls Jay into a hug
Okay
The Colonel leaves
Jay and Kay congratulate each other, smile over a job well done
But then they see the Archanans
And realize
100
We're sorry we didn't get you home, guys
It was the only way to get rid of Yaz
But we'll make sure you're safe here
And the next rocket out
All is well
You have done well
No we didn't
You wanted to go home
There is what we desire and what must be
And now our gift to you
Gift
But we didn't get you home
There is the action and there is the intention
It is the intention we reward
You did the right thing
And if humans are capable of such sacrifice, such friendship
perhaps we  already home
So then what's the gift
You already have it
Jay looks at pong
This
Pong
Yes
The Pan-Galactic Ordnance Negation Grid
Agent Kay will use this technology
To make the missile defense system
You use this to save the world
101
Yes
Don't drop it
They take the  and drape it around Kay's neck The Archanans leave, chanting
(') () Bip
Bip
Bip
And it's just Jay and Kay
Jay looks at Kay wearing the
just like in the case file picture
Hey
My watch stopped
We see -- a minute to go
Jay looks at the watch
Something about it bothers him
'mon
Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere
Yeah, 'll catch up with you in a second
Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the scaffolding
So you guys understand all this time stuff, right
So is everything going to be okay now mean, if  saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am  even here
Shouldn't  not have come in the first place
And why do still have time left on my watch
The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of underground hallways
Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking
102
,He sees a   -- 3:59
3:59
But Kay didn't get killed until
And then the   -- (') He didn't come yet
Kay, he didn't come yet
Jay races to find Kay
Unaware that his appointment with death is near
Racing down a hallway
hunting Kay
Running
running
searching
where is Kay
All converging on destiny
Running
more frantic now
And then he sees him
Kay -- at the end of the hallway
Backlit by the door to the outside
Kay
And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there
Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot
Yaz pulls his guns
103
Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to know '
Yaz
But --   is somehow there instead
He catches the bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes
And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to , blowing him  -- where he is leftover from the launch
They look at each other -- it's over
See
knew you had my back
Jay hears footsteps
Looks up and sees the --    '
As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller, shrinking to
It's a boy
' Dad
What's going on
The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be Where there is death, there will always be death
He saved your life
He swapped his for yours
He saved the world
Kay puts a firm hand on Jay -- 'll take it from here
Kay steps away
but turns back
In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer
Leave me some memories this time, Sure, partner
'll see you around
104
Yes you will
Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand
Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was -- hands it to the son
Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to have this
Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain
Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and worn
Where is he
Your daddy had to go -- he's part of the space program, now
He's okay, he just had to take a trip up to the stars, but you'll be just fine
'll keep an eye on you
They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo launch
Jay takes out his iPhone and
And it resolves into
-
Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and Noo
And then
giant   rises over the horizon and 105
/ Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security guard
It's good to see you, man
He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell
" face
Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can
No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their he never left
It all seems the same except for quick shots of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee cart
Jay bounces through the MiB  -- it's just a regular day to everyone else, but it's    to Jay
He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug
crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on winning the Bowling trophy
Kay looks up --   when he sees Jay
Alright, everyone, give me and my partner here a minute
They leave the guys alone
beat -- and Jay just wraps him in
It's good to see you, man
So good
just
do you remember
mean, do you know what 've been through
Kay just stares at him
You mean, do  remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world
Not bad, slick
Not bad
No problem
You'd do the same for me
just have one question
() 106
(') When you disappeared
Why didn't forget you when everyone else did
Well,  don't know exactly
Because  was dead
But in a quantum reality, objects can exist in contradictory states
So multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist, and the one you're closest to -- Oh, you're talking about our closeness
you're talking about our love
Across timelines
You're saying our love will go on
Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear
Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain
Takes it out
(') He was a good man
Yes he was
'm glad  know that
So you travelled back in time, huh
Yep
Wow
And you didn't change anything
No
You're sure
Because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions
was very careful
107
Good man, good man
Well, let's get you a uniform
Excuse me
We   -- Revealing
Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and all its inhabitants
And every one of those agents wearing
(') Even  can't make that look good
