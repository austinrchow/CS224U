He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume strange   plays out in sequential patterns

Five other technicians, in various states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console
The Supervisor enters, tying his robe
God,  hope it's not just another damned Russian spy job
(overlapping) Negative
Computer affirms the signal is unidentified
(hanging up the phone) The boy from Air Res Traffic say the skies are clear
No terrestrial launches
It's the real thing
radio signal from another world
The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of searching the heavens, they might have finally found something
Let's not jump the gun
Run a trajectory source computation
Tech Three slides over to another computer
(cont'd) want to know exactly where it's coming from
This can't be right
Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief
What's wrong
Calculated distance from source is at three hundred and eight five thousand kilometers
(turning to Supervisor) It's coming from the moon
The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the speaker
As they listen to the strange  we
: -  - Elevator doors  revealing four star  , Commander in Chief
Space Command
Understandably nervous, the   escorts him down the hall
Who else knows about this
in New Mexico identified a signal but they're even more confused than we are
The General shoots him a disapproving glance
Excuse me, Sir
He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly open
-   - Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working feverishly through the night
The Officers cross the room
Super: - Satellite reception has been impaired but we were able to get these
They arrive at a glass table
The surrounding officers snap to attention as a   quickly brings over a large transparency

The two Officers exchange a glance
We estimate it has a diameter of over five hundred and fifty kilometers and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon
The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned

No Sir
Definitely not
How do you know
Well, er
it's slowing down
It's doing what
It's

The General walks over to a phone, picks it up
Get me the Secretary of Defense
(pause) Then wake him up
: '  - - Laying in bed
reads a stack of papers
The phone

It's me
The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how he feels about the woman on the other end
Hi honey
What time is it there
- Dressed in a night gown,
unpacks her briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks
Through the window we  Los Angeles at night
Two in the morning know didn't wake you
(filtered) As a matter of fact you did
(smiles) Liar
- Whitmore sits up
have a confession to make
There's a beautiful young blonde sleeping next to me
Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter,
(filtered) You didn't let her stay up watching
all night
Of course not
The little girl stirs awake, looks up
Mommy
You're flying back right after the luncheon
Okay, here she is
Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed
Habitably he turns on the television
- Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion program
The picture quality is snowy, static ridden
#1 the inexperience in public office was inevitably going to catch up with him
He's scarified his ideals for "politics as usual
" Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality
#2 said this during the campaign
Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War has no relationship to political leadership
It's a different animal
Suddenly the channel changes
cartoon comes on
Whitmore turns to his daughter who holds he remote
(into phone) Daddy let me watch Letterman
Traitor
Whitmore exits the room
- As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps to attention
Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a bench
Good morning, Mr
President
Good morning, George
The paper is dropped revealing  , mid- thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications director
Quickly she gathers her things and follows Whitmore
- Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance enter
Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee
You're up early this morning, Connie
She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands
They're not attacking your policies, they're attacking your age
(another paper; reading) "
addressing Congress, Whitmore seems less like the President and more like the orphan child Oliver asking, 'please sir, 'd like some more
'" Clever
Age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun
You were thought of as young and idealistic
But the message has gotten lost
There's too much compromise, too much politics
(pointedly) Isn't it amazing how fast everyone can turn against you
Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him another paper
Well, the Orange County Register has named you one of the ten sexiest men of the year
You see, substance at last

Excuse me, Mr

It's the Secretary of Defense

He concentrates intensely on his next move

smokes a cigar impatiently
What are you waiting
My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there
'm thinking
So think already
David makes a move
Instantly Moishe counters his move
David furls his brow in thought
Again he's thinking
Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a Styrofoam cup
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose
You don't move soon
'll begin to decompose
Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again
David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board
(cont'd) David, 've been meaning to talk with you
It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but
Dad, don't start
'm only saying, it's been what
Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers
Three years
Three, four
Move on
It's not healthy
Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs
Look who's talking healthy
Suddenly David's beeper goes off
How many times is that now
You trying to get fired
David moves his queen
Checkmate
See you tomorrow, Dad
He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away
That's not checkmate  can still
Oh
(yelling after him) You could let an old man win once in a while, it wouldn't kill you
: - David pedals his bike through mid-town Manhattan
He arrives at
- His bike hoisted on his shoulder, David squeezes through the revolving doors
, short, nervous and harried, comes rushing over
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on
It was turned on
was ignoring you
What's the big emergency
Started this morning
Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty
Snow, static, all kinds of distortions
No one knows what the hell is going on
David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his coke bottle in the trash
David retrieves it
Damn it, Marty
There's a reason we have bins labeled "recycle
" Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty accusingly
What the hell is this
So sue me
Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the room
- Technicians are working feverishly
Clearly every monitor is experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption
David moves over to the main console
Did you try to switch to transponder channels
Please, would  be this panicked if it was that simple
David examines the readouts, puzzled
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite
We've tried
It's not working
It's almost as though they weren't even there
David looks up, puzzled
That's impossible
: Bad reception
hand  the side of it
No use
: - Eleven-year-old   tries to fix the television
His older brother , seventeen, cooks breakfast
Stop it
It's all fuzzy
You're gonna break it
Just leave it alone
Here, take your medicine
Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in front of Troy
Troy pushes the bottle away
don't need it
(pushing it back) Just take it, dick head
(turning to his sister) Alicia
Make sure he takes his medicine
His sister, , fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much makeup
Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits the television again

An angry  jumps out, slamming his door
- Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the angry farmers, , who marches over
Miguel edges her out of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself
Morning, Lucas
Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables
You like these
've got a whole goddamned crop full
Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet
(cont'd) Where the hell is your father
You know what time it is
He had to re-fuel
There musta been a problem
We both know what the problem is
He's a damned nut case, is what he is
musta been out of my mind
Troy  the television again
Troy, stop it
swear to God
Miguel, if he's not in the air in twenty minutes, that's it
'm getting someone else
Lucas storms away
Again, Troy whacks at the television
Stop it, Troy
swear to God
Determined, Troy  the television again
This time the picture goes out completely

The separated  themselves are enormous
Slowly they twist downwards on a collision course to the blue planet below
Earth

#1 is running a story that we're covering up some kind of nuclear testing experiments
Tell them to run with it if they want to embarrass themselves
#2 has been up my butt all morning
They want to know our position
Our official position is we don't have an official position
#3 Connie, what the hell is going on
Constance escapes into the elevator, turns around
(smiles confidently) Come on, people
Would  keep you guys out of the loop
#1 In a second
#2 Absolutely
Before she can retort, the elevator doors close
- - The President, General Grey, the    and White House Chief of Staff   are gathered around the couch
At the moment, our satellites are somewhat unreliable
Isn't it possible that thing may just pass us by
What if it doesn't "pass us by
" Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow it out of the sky
Forgive me, but with the little information we do have, the only thing that would accomplish is turn one dangerous falling object into many
Just then the door opens and Constance enters
What's the damage
The press is making up their own stories at this point
(to General Grey) Get on the horn with Atlantic Command
Let's upgrade the situation to  3
That's not your call to make, Mr
Nimziki
Isn't that a little premature
don't think so
We're two days away from the fourth of July
We have over fifty percent of our armed forces on weekend leave, not to mention the troops and commanders we	have in town for the Fourth of July	parade
We call them back now, we're sending up a major red flag
They go quiet as Commanding Officer from Space Command dashes into the room
Our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit
Well that's good news
Not really
He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table
Everyone gathers around
Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen other pieces
Pieces
Smaller than the whole, yet over fifteen miles in width themselves
Where are they heading
They should be entering our atmosphere within the next twenty- five minutes
The room is silenced
All eyes turn to the President who says nothing
Nimziki leans in close to him
Like it or not, we're at  3
Recall the troops and put them on yellow alert

David leans into frame and opens the door to the microwave
We  to reveal
'  -   - David retrieves his home-make cup-a-soup
We  this cubicle clearly has the David touch; ecology posters, plants, tons of computers and electronic gizmos
Please, tell me you're getting something
Marty enters, looking over David's shoulder as he eats
There's good news and bad news
What's the bad news
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch
And the good news is you won't charge me
No
The good news is  found the problem and it's not our equipment
There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed
That's the good news
David slides over to another computer and turns on an intricate computation program
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it
When find the exact binary sequence and  apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer  built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely
and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture
That's my man

Looking up he something in the air

Spraying insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field
(yelling) Russell
God damn it, Russell
Looking down from the cockpit,   waves stupidly
Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image of a fifty-one-year-old little boy
Miguel follows him below, screaming at him
Russell, flying recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding
By the time he looks back he
at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him
In a trick move, Russell turns the plane on  , and  through the narrow gap between the trees
Miguel screams with delight at his prowess
Miguel looks pissed
-     - Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi- with plane
Just what the hell do you think you're doing
(climbing down) 'm bringing home the bacon
Earning my keep
And doing a fine job if  do say so myself
It's the wrong field, you idiot
Lucas' farm is on the other side of town
You sure
Damn it, he was doing you a favor
You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy
() What are we supposed to do now
Huh
Where are we supposed to go now
Pissed, Miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at Russell
Pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a bottle of Jack Daniels
He takes a healthy swig

Ubiquitous overcrowding and poverty
Several hundred refugees settle down for the night
Super: Northern Desert, Iraq stokes a small fire besides his family's tent

The Bedouin watches them with confusion
Overcome with curiosity he goes against the tide of people, up the hillside
As the Bedouin reaches the top of the hillside, his mouth falls open, aghast as he

The Lieutenant moves over to the main radar screen
The entire upper portion of the screen is

He diverts the Lieutenant's attention to another screen; light bleeds off the map

Sir, we now have visual range with incoming over Iraqi airspace

Yes Sir, this just came in from the Eisenhower
The Commanding Officer grabs a phone laying off the hook
Correction, we have two confirmed visual contacts
One over Iraq, one over the Pacific
- The room is packed
The President and his chief advisors are there along with the Joint Chief of Staff
Representatives from the Atlantic Command and
Space Command have formed small clusters around telephones
Where in the Pacific
(turning to the President) They've spotted one off the California coast line
Surrounded by the Secret Service, the President is speechless
Constance Halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to the President
Put it on
Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the

There is mass hysteria behind the reporter

Moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor, astronomers are baffled as to its origin
Everyone is locked onto the television, mesmerized

Hundreds have been injured
General Grey confers with the Atlantic command
He nods, turns to the President and whispers

Two more have been spotted over the Atlantic
One is moving toward New York, the other is headed this direction
How much time do we have
Less than ten minutes
(turning to aid) Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain
(to President) Sir,  strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately
The President hesitates, he turns to Constance
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia
More than likely
Mr
President, you can discuss this on the way
Torn, the President grapples with a decision
Finally
'm not leaving
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis
want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location
'm staying here
am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives
But, Mr
President
So far these things have not become hostile
For the moment let's assume they won't
(to Constance) Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover
Constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly exit along with most people in the room
General Grey goes over to the President
With your permission, Mr
President, 'd like to remain my your side

Sir, what happens if they do become hostile
Then God help us

Oblivious, David works his computers

David waves her away, deep in concentration
Suddenly a computer
Excitedly David prints out his finding
He grabs it and exits
- Engrossed in his printout, David walks past his co-workers who are glued to the distorted picture on the television, watching the phenomenon
'  - Marty stares at his television watching General Grey addressing the press
David enters, staring at his reading
've got a lock on the signal pattern
We can filter it out
(distracted) Huh
Oh, good, hood
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway
The signal reduces itself every time it recycles
Eventually it will disappear
Are you listening
(still glued to
) Can you believe this
What re you talking about
Haven't you been watching
David turns for the first time to the television and sees the phenomenon
Constance comes on addressing the press
(filtered) so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage
In all likelihood it won't

everyone should remain calm
Take cover where you can but the important thing is not to panic

There is a mix of fascination and panic
David watches the commotion, dumb struck
Oh shit,  better call my wife
- Depressed Russell nurses a beer at the counter
Three walk in, having a good laugh
One of them spots Russell and moves over to him
#1 Hey, Russ, heard you had a little trouble this morning
Dusted the wrong field
The Mechanics laugh
Russell tries to ignore them
#2 know, you're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience
#2 Hostage experience

there are additional unconfirmed sightings over Japan, the Mediterranean, and China
They are positioning themselves all over the world and using this one signal to synchronize their efforts
In approximately six hours the signal will disappear and the countdown will be over
Then what
Checkmate
Marty takes a beat to digest
Then, grabbing the phone
gotta call my brother, my bookie, my lawyer
fuck my lawyer
David also grabs a phone
Suddenly the bank of monitors synchronize into one enormous image across the entire video wall; the President addressing the nation
,   - The President stands at the podium giving his address
My fellow Americans, a historic and unprecedented event has taken place
The question as to whether or not we are alone in the universe has been answered
- As Constance watches the President, she unconsciously mouths the words of his speech, after all, she did write them tugs on her sleeve
She tries to wave her off
He says he's your husband
Her expression drops
She takes the phone from her
What do you want
(filtered) You have to leave the White House
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion
- You don't understand
You have to leave Washington ,   - Impatient, Constance tries to get off the phone
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here
(filtered) 've worked with embedded loading
They're communicating with a hidden signal
They're going to attack
You're being paranoid

The embedding is very subtle
It's probably been overlooked
Constance hangs up
Her face betrays mixed emotions
- David stares at the phone, pissed
Something on
catches his attention
Through the snowy image he
(filtered) My staff and  are remaining here at the White House while we attempt to establish communication
Hanging up the phone, David sprints for the exit
(cont'd) so remain calm
If you are compelled to leave these cities, please do so in a safe and orderly fashion
: - The rush to get away creeps slowly as cars jam the streets in total grid-lock
David pedals his bike furiously through traffic
-   - The mass exodus has reached the bridge
Total congestion
David fights his way through
,   - The New York skyline behind him across the Hudson, David jumps off his bike, and races towards a row of tract houses
'   - David  on the door
It flies open
Moishe is holding a hunting rifle, pointing it at David
Pops
The television said they've started with the looting already Vultures
You still got the Olds
You want to borrow the car
You don't have a license
That's okay
You're driving
: '  - Steve, wearing his Marine flight officer uniform, shoves the last of his things into his duffel bag
We notice there are small figurines of dolphins everywhere
Jasmine hovers nervously behind him
You can't go
Call them back
Baby, you know how it is
have to report to El Toro right away
You said you were on leave for the Fourth
They cancelled it
Why are you acting like this
Jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away
We  the alien craft through the window
Why
That's why
That thing scares the piss out of me
- Dylan sits behind the wheel pretending to drive
Steve grabs him, pulling him out
He reaches into his duffel, grabs a small brown paper bag
Here
got these for you
Be careful with them
Dylan opens the bag; fireworks
Jasmine walks over
Cool
Steve tosses his gear into the back, opens his door
Wait

What
(loses her nerve) Be careful
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base
Really
You don't mind
(smiling) Naw

Pissed, she hits him
He loves it
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are
Yes,  am
Dick-weed
Butt-munch
They kiss
Steve hops into his car and peels out
Jasmine takes the bag from Dylan
'll take these
Mommmmmm
: -  - perfectly preserved '68 Olds drives cautiously down the highway
Around him we see other cars packed to the gills as they make their escape from New York
- Not the most confident driver, Moishe holds the steering wheel close to his chest
It's the White House, for crying out loud
You can't just drive up and ring the bell
Can't this thing go any faster
You think they don't know what you know
Believe me, they know
She works for the President
They know everything
They don't know this
And you're going to educate them
Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at to become a cable repairman
Dad
All 'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David
They want , they'll call you
: ,   - Mrs
Whitmore is at a house phone
Behind her we see several news crews waiting for interviews
(filtered through phone) want you out of there
You're staying there to keep people calm
It's the right thing to do
'm not going to let them criticize you for it
-   - The President sits on his bed, his daughter lays next to him, watching
The signal distortion is getting worse
Okay, fine but the second your interviews are done,  have a helicopter ready to take you to Nellis Air Force

She's glued to the

Here she is
He hands Patty the phone as General Grey and Nimziki appear in the doorway
The President walks over to them
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far
This is crazy
We're loosing our first strike capabilities
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere
Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication
What the hell are they up to
: - long crowded highway of people trying to escape from Los Angeles can be seen in the distance
The huge space craft hovering behind them
Miguel is on the roof of the trailer, adjusting the

Mortified, Miguel can't believe what he's seeing
They've got to do something

They did all kinds of experiments on me
They've been studying us for years, learning our weakness
We've go to do something before they kill us all
(
) Just as Troy starts to climb up, Miguel changes the channel to Mrs
Whitmore
Troy sits down next to Miguel
(filtered) we need to remain calm
As more people decide to leave the cities, safety is key
Troy, you remember Uncle Hector, from Tucson
He's got that  Saturn , 64 bit, right
Yeah
What would you think if we went there to live for a while
That'd be cool
Miguel thinks for a second, makes a decision
Pack up, we're going
Miguel jumps down from the roof
Troy climbs down the ladder
(yelling after him) What about Dad
Kissing
It's getting hot
Alicia laughs, pushes him away
This could be our last night on Earth
You don't want to die a virgin, do you
What makes you think 'm a virgin
The Older Boy is taken off guard
Before he can answer the tarp they were hiding under is ripped away
Miguel stands there
Come on, we're going
'm not going anywhere
Miguel grabs her by the wrist and pulls her away
-   - We see the long highway leading to Washington, the space ship hovering above it
One side of the freeway is packed solid, the other completely empty, save for one car
'  - Moishe looks to the other side of the freeway, jam packed
On his side, they are the only car for miles
The whole world is trying to get out of Washington and we're the only schmucks trying to get in
As Moishe drives, David distracts him as he unpacks his backpack unloading his laptop
He grabs a
(cont'd) What the hell is that
This, pops, is every phone book in America
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies
Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname
David starts to look it up
Suddenly
In the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re- directed by the military to use the opposite side of the highway
Oh my God
Moishe  violently to avoid collision, barely missing the oncoming traffic
Dodging right to left, Moishe hangs on for dear life
Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just in time to see the Olds whiz by
David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as Moishe tries to veer through traffic
Suddenly    blocks off their only escape route
Moishe turns  and drives up onto the right shoulder
- The Olds is the only car in headed that direction
Using the shoulder, swerving to miss barricades, they drives off an exit ramp
Nice driving, pops
Dangerously close to a heart attack, Moishe is, for once, at a loss for words
Over their adrenaline pumped faces
(
) put your hands together for Sabrina
: -   - bikini-clad Sabrina twirls gracefully on the stage
As she comes to a stop we reveal Sabrina is actually Jasmine
She looks out into the audience and her expression

All crowded near the television watching the news

(filtered) from the "it could only happen in California" file, hundreds of fanatics have gathered on the rooftops of downtown Los Angeles, welcoming the new arrivals
- Jasmine storms into the dressing room
Wiping off her makeup, she sits down next to  who watches the same report on a small b&w
can't believe  even came in tonight
What was  thinking
(re:
) Isn't this cool
And you thought was nuts
Oh, look,  brought mine with me
Tiffany holds up a drawing of a space alien
You're not thinking of joining those idiots
'm going over there soon as 'm off
Wanna come
Jasmine turns to Tiffany, dead serious
Tiffany,  don't want you to go up there
Promise me you won't
(Tiffany pouts) Promise
promise
Okay
'm gone
'm outta town for a while
Her boss  enters and walks over to his private office in back
He opens the door and finds Dylan playing with his dog, Boomer
What the hell's your kid doing here
Jasmine rushes past picking up Dylan and carrying him away as she heads for the exit
Boomer follows
You try to find a sitter today
Where do you think you're going
You leave, you're fired
(out the door) Nice working with you, Mario
: - The streets are nearly deserted
Millions of small lights on the underbelly of the craft cast strange reflections on the streets below
The Olds drives on its way towards the Capitol building
- David types frustratedly on his laptop
Not listed, huh
just haven't found it yet tried
Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook
Spunky
College nickname
You try Martin
She didn't take my name when we were married
Moishe shrugs
David gives it a shot
Finds it
The machine (sarcastic) So what do  know
: -      - crowded locker room
Steve enters
(
) Where the hell've you been
Ah, were you guys waiting for me
Several Marines throws towels at Steve as he makes his way to his locker
His best friend, , sits next to him
Can you believe it
This is serious shit, Stevie
They've recalled everyone As Steve sits he  some envelops stuck into the side of his locker
Well, the mail's still working
He flips through the envelops and  when he sees one with the  insignia on it
Jimmy snatches it away from him
Junk mail
You don't want this
Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads
From the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news
Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder
don't believe it
They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down
What else do they want you to learn
How to kiss ass
Steve crumples at the letter and tosses it
Angrily he opens his locker
Pasted on the locker door we see photos of Jasmine next to the photos of the space shuttle, Apollo Missions, and a insignia bumper sticker
As Steve stuffs his jacket into the locker, something falls out
Before Steve can grab it, Jimmy snatches it up first
(embarrassed) Jasmine has this thing for dolphins
had them make it
thought you said you were doing to break it off
Steve snatches it back, embarrassed
(cont'd) Steve, listen to me, you're never gonna get to fly the space shuttle if you marry a stripper
Steve knows he's right
He's torn
: -   - The Olds stops near the White House
From here we can tanks and armed patrols
small group of protesters have gathered, upset about the military hardware
Signs: "Don't provoke" "Violence begets Violence
" - David adjusts a small portable satellite, connecting it to his phon and laptop computer
So, you want to ring the bell or should
David flips open the phone, dials the number on the screen
Perfect, she's using it
It's perfect the line is busy
Yes
can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House
You can do that
Shooting his father a look
(sarcastic) All cable repairmen can

Sally, take my cat with when you leave
No 'm staying here at the White House

Surprised, she answers

How'd you get this number
Walk to the window
Right in front of you

She walks over to it, looking out
What am  looking for

Troy sleeps while Miguel drives
Suddenly Miguel his the brakes, as something comes
We realize it's the -  landing on the stretch of roadway directly in front of them
- The plane lands, skids into a turn
Russell jumps out, walks over to the trailer
We can tell he's drunk again
They let you out
Just what the hell do you think you're doing
Miguel moves to meet Russell away from the trailer, not wanting the others to hear
We're leaving, don't try and stop us
You're not going anywhere
You hear me
'm still your father
Miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time
No, you're not
You're just the man who married my mother
You're nothing to me
Russell is momentarily silent, stunned
Recovering
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy
Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up
Who
Suddenly we hear glass
Both men spin to find Troy standing behind them
Stop it
'm not a baby
don't need your stupid medicine don't need anyone to take care of me
Miguel leans down to see the broken   on the floor
Miguel rushes over to him, furious
You know what this stuff costs
Do you want to get sick again
Do you
Frustrated, Miguel shoves Troy aside and heads back into the trailer
Wobbly from the drinking, Russell stands there pathetically, watching
- large group of press rush over toward , each refitted with a large  , as they slowly lift off the ground
Cameras flash, reporters yell questions to the Officers assigned to keep them at bay
Several news organizations do stand up remotes
We  past them to the  crew

The reception is intermittently disrupted

) each has been refitted with what Pentagon officially hope will be our first step in communicating with the alien craft
We  to reveal a large contingent of military personnel along with the President's chief advisors gathered around several monitors, (the center monitors are momentarily blank)
Suddenly everyone snaps to attention as the President enters
Where are we
They're in the air
: - Moishe inspects a photo of Constance with the President, impressed he nods with approval
(to himself) Very nice
Constance is looking at David's laptop displaying the breakdown of the alien signal
And when is the countdown supposed to expire
(checking) Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds
Constance runs her fingers through her hair, exasperated
Moishe turns, listens
What do you want me to do
want you to leave with us
Right now
can't leave
We have to tell this to the President
He's not going to listen to me
Surprised at his son, Moishe steps forward
Sure he'll listen
Why wouldn't he
Because last time  saw him punched him in the face
You punched the President in the face
He wasn't the President then
David thought  was having an affair, which wasn't Punched the President
Oh my god
by overhead
In the distance we see they are headed for the enormous alien craft

Echo one, we are closing in
- The choppers alter their formation, aligning themselves alongside one another
As the helicopters near the craft, we see how tiny they appear against the gargantuan space ship
-  -   - The elevator doors open and Moishe steps out, overwhelmed and impressed
Constance leads them down the hall
Moishe turns to David, whispers
If  had known  was going to meet the President, 'd a worn a tie
Look at me,  look like a schlemiel
- The Office is empty as the trio walks in
Moishe can't believe he's in there
He straightens himself up, combs his hair
Wait here

David sets up his laptop
Not on his desk

They show the night vision of the helicopters as they approach
On the side monitors we  the various news broadcast of this event

Chief of Staff Nimziki objects
You're leaving now The President silences him with a look
As they exit
don't know how you put up with him
He used to run the
He knows where all the bones are buried
Comes in handy

The moment President Whitmore sees David, he freezes
What the hell's he doing here
Moishe, bursting, steps forward
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr
President
My ex-husband works in satellite communications
don't have time for this
With a , David suddenly  everything off the President's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter
It's about "Line o sight," Mr
President
David draws a circle representing Earth and a smaller circle just away from it
The President reluctantly nears
If you wanted t coordinate with ships all over the world, you couldn't send one signal to every place at the same time
That's called line of sight
Drawing a line from the ship of either side of the Earth, we that you could not send a signal to the other side
(cont'd) you'd need to relay your signal using satellites
David draws small satellites surrounding Earth
(cont'd) to reach each ship
have found a signal hidden inside our own satellite network
Suddenly an aide, , appears in the doorway
Excuse me, Mr
President
They're starting
The President turns to the monitor in his office
We  the helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front of their cockpits
He turns back to David
Mr
President, they are using our own satellites against us and the clock is ticking

- The helicopters are puny little specs next to this Goliath
The light boards continues to  but there is no reaction from the ship
- Everyone is glued to the monitors as the President storms in
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command
Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can
But Mr
President
And get those helicopters away from the ship
Call them back immediately
General Grey obeys, turning to an assistant who quickly grabs a phone
Nimziki steps up to the President
What the hell's going on
We're leaving
An  motions to the monitors
They're responding
The room goes silent, everyone turns to the monitors
-   & On all screens we  the space ship as a long thin line of suddenly emits from the side of the craft, illuminating the four Apache Helicopters
- The light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming from the space craft
Suddenly with a loud  , the white light spills out as the huge  unfolds at the side of the craft
The four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions, as something powerful emits from the schism in the ship
Then like a gigantic bug-zapper, the four pesky little Apache Helicopters are     , one by one
They leave no time to retreat

Whitmore packs her bag, as the horrifying image of the destruction of the helicopter replays on the

She holds it up to the sky, proudly

The news plays over her car radio
authorities have called for a complete evacuation of Los Angeles County
People are advised to avoid the highways whenever possible
Now he tells me

The President ushers her into the helicopter
He turns back and see a military guard holding back Moishe and David
They're okay
Let them on

Is my wife in the air
She should be shortly
David flips open his laptop which reads: 09:07
09:96
-  - The Presidential helicopter lifts off as several other helicopters wait behind, people filing into them
-   - The Police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the believers who refuse to budge
Suddenly the entire rooftop is
They all grow silent staring up at the craft
Above them another  has opened at the bottom of the craft, the white light spilling out
As though the heavens had opened, the  believers lift their arms, waiting to be taken
Take me
No, take me
Take me
Slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship directly on the top of this building

Suddenly Troy moves up to the front on wobbly legs
Guys,  don't feel so good
When was the last time you had your medicine
Four days

Troy looks really sick
Miguel is shocked
But  gave you some this morning

An instant refugee city, if you will, for as far as the eye can see
Spectacular

You will be the first wave in our counter attack
Though surveillance satellite reconnaissance has been impaired, we have a fix on our primary target

Constance sits down next to him
She knows what he's thinking
You saved a lot of lives
could have evacuated the cities hours ago
(beat) You know, when  flew in the Gulf War everything is simple
We knew what we had to do
It's not simple anymore, Connie
lot of people died today
How many didn't have to
Constance realizes there's no comforting him
She supports him silently by being there
General Grey comes over
Any news on my wife
The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact
The news rocks the President
They both know what that means
(cont'd) The fighters are in the air
Whitmore nods and follows the General to the back of the plane

Military and technical crew are seated at the controls
Nimziki is already there

Look at me, like a rock
Good weather, bad, doesn't matter

David can't take any more of this story and takes off running for the bathroom
What  say
Constance comes over, sits next to Moishe
He still gets air sick, huh
In all of this  didn't get the chance to thank you two
Think nothing of it, Spanky
Constance smiles, corrects him

Suddenly about a quarter mile before they reach it, they , as though blown out of the sky
When the smoke clears we see there has been zero damage
'  - Damn it
(filtered) didn't even see them fire
Command, Eagle One
Switching to "sidewinders
"  We're moving in
- In unison these amazing birds  together, realigning themselves into six groups of five, spreading out to attack different areas of the ship
' The first attack group, Steve's, are the first to near the colossal alien craft
Simultaneously they drop their -9 sidewinder missiles
-9 They reach the same quarter-mile proximity and
'  - They must have some kind of protective shield surrounding their hull
Pull up
Most of the fighters do, but one is too late and  into the ship's protective shield
- Steve's squadron  hard, skirting the edge of the ship's protective shield
As the fighters approach, the alien ship's enormous doors
Suddenly     dart out towards our fighters
(filtered) Evasive maneuvers
Check Six
Just moving away in time, our Fighters barely dodge the oncoming enemy Attackers as they  a  of (tracker bullet-like lasers) showering the sky
As Steve's plane , an Attacker follows
Jimmy's plane pulls up behind the attacker
- Jimmy's  has the alien attacker in his sights
(filtered) Got you covered, Stevie
Jimmy , another -9 Sidewinder
The Sidewinder overtakes the attacker as Steve   out of position
Five yards before the sidewinder can get to the Attacker, it
Shit
They've got shield too
' Banks back around to get a shot
Just as he turns, three American Fighters are    from Attacker tracer fire
The Attackers are in hot pursuit of Jimmy's fighter
The Fighter flying next to Jimmy is
Jimmy, roll right
'll cover
Jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as Steve fires another Sidewinder, momentarily distracting the Attacker
Jimmy falls in line with Steve as the attackers turn on them
Both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at Narrowly missing the ground, they bank away
The Attackers can't follow
- Fighter after fighter begin to disappear from the display screens
We're losing them
Then get them out of there
Suddenly one of the large radar display maps
We've lost the satellite
Before he can adjust, another monitor
- One by one we  the fighters getting
Fireballs litter the laser-tracer fire covered skies
Maybe we can out run them
Follow my lead
Jimmy and Steve bank away from the craft, hit the supercruise, at Mach 2
Both  Jimmy and Steve are held tight against their seats, straining against the -Force
Two Attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit
Steve and Jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds, the attackers slowly gaining on them
Jimmy, kick it
They're gaining
We're already over Mach 2
So push it
Readouts show the  planes flying beyond measurement
'  - As the  planes accelerate, Jimmy fights to remain conscious
Stevie
can't
Jimmy, stay with me
Jimmy slowly loses consciousness
His fighter slows, drifting off to the right
gain on them
One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and
' Laser-tracers  the Fighter
It
Job done, his Attacker banks away, returning to Los Angeles
No
Steve's Attacker stays right with him, slowly gaining
Steve kicks his harder, keeping the distance
: -   - radar  spots something on his screens
He turns to Captain Watson
We have incoming
Friendly
don't think so
Watson hits an alarm which
-  - dozen  race out onto the field, running for their planes
Before anyone can reach them, the sky darkens with who  the runway
- Through the front glass of the tower we  the Attackers firing
One fires directly at the tower
Watson  for cover as everything around him erupts into a gigantic - The entire base goes up in flames
: -  &  - Steve looks down over the side of his fighter
'  - - Steve
Surprised, the Attacker
Taking the moment, Steve  down
(to himself) Okay, jerk-off
Let's have some fun
The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously close to the canyon walls
The Attacker has trouble keeping up with him but does
Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking, diving, swerving
The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and closer
Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways
Still the Attacker follows close
- Near empty
Frustrated, Steve gets pissed
Damn it
Steve turns down a dead and side canyon
The Attacker is right on his tail
Let's see if you're fully equipped
The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the canyon wall
Suddenly Steve yanks his   - Stave   into the air
The Fighter  into the canyon wall
The Attacker can't turn in time
He tries to pull up, over it, just misses the top of the canyon wall
As the nose of the Attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall the Attacker is  ,     over the top of the canyon
The parachute on Steve's ejection seat pops
- Rolling end over end, the Attacker is banged up  as it finally comes to a stop
Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing
Rolling over, Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself
He stands and looks around
Spotting the beat up and incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved look
He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker
He scans it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar
With all his might, Steve  the door
For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure
The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and , knocking the alien totally unconscious
His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory Dance cigar
He lights it and takes a long angry puff
Now that's a close encounter
: -   -  - It's dark
The hole Jasmine had entered is now blocked
She pushes but it won't budge
Exhausted, she ignites her lighter to get a better look around
As it lights we  that we are inside a maintenance garage
Jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead
Taking Dylan by the hand she moves to the large garage doors but she can't open them
She turns around and see a large maintenance truck, a huge land-mover shovel attached to the front
She smiles
- With a  the large door   as the maintenance truck  through
Once out, Jasmine hits the brakes
- '  -
Total devastation
Remnants of cars and buildings smoldering
Three scattered survivors crawl from the wreckage nightmare of destruction
The space craft above, slowly leaving
Mommy, what happened
(astonished) don't know, badly
: -    - We see dozens of trailers packing up their gear, some already on the road
Miguel talks with one of the drivers, then hurries away, running
- Russell wipes down Troy's forehead, he's burning up
Alicia brings over a cold compress
You know, you're just like your mother
She was stubborn too had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine
'm sorry, Dad
(beat; scared) 'm not goin to die like mom, am You're going to be fine
Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside
couldn't find anything
Everyone is packing up, they're leaving
Word is a space ship is heading this way
We should leave too
There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away
think we should follow them
Russell nods in agreement
knock on the door
Alicia turns to find a handsome young boy,  in the doorway holding a bottle of pills
Penicillin
At least it will help keep his fever down
It's really nice of you to help us
wish  could do more but we're moving out
(too eager) We're going with you
mean, we're going too
Cool
Alicia nods, smitten
Philip smiles charmingly and leaves
: - Back in the passenger section, the President sits with General Grey and Chief of Staff Nimziki
The Technician from the command module is briefing them
They must be targeting our satellites
We've lost all satellite communication, tracking and mapping
Have  relay intelligence to our on board computers
The Technician nods and exits
Defeated, the President slumps sullenly
We've moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but we've already sustained heavy losses
The President nods his approval absently
Coming out of the bathroom, David overhears
spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at
They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike
Hit 'em with everything we've got
Above American soil
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend
The Technician returns, his face is white with fear
What's the latest from
It's gone, sir
They've taken out That's impossible
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs
Mr
President, we must launch delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities
That stings the President
He considers the option
David is shocked
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons
David, don't
David pushes past her
If you fire nukes, so will the rest of the world
Do you know what that kind of fall out will do
How many innocent people
The General gets up running interference
Constance tries to pull David back
(stern) Sir, i remind you that you are just a guest here
(overlapping) David, please
This is insanity
You'll kill us and them at the same time
There'll be nothing left
(interrupting) Sit down and shut up
Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting
Don't tell him to shut up
You'd all be dead, were it not for my David
You didn't do anything to prevent this
As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to calm him down
Sir, there wasn't much more we could have done
We were totally unprepared for this
Don't give me unprepared
Since nineteen fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship, the thing you found in New Mexico
(embarrassed) Dad, please
What was it, Roswell
You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one That's it
Area fifty one
You knew and you didn't do nothing
For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles
Regardless of what the tabloids have said, there were never any space crafts recovered by the government
Take my word for it, there is no Area 51 and no recovered space ship
Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat
Uh, excuse me, Mr
President, but that's not entirely accurate
The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked
laying across the roadway
Suddenly , Jasmine's maintenance truck  through
-   - With the massive devastation in the b
g
, Jasmine drives the maintenance truck down the highway
In the back, the few survivors she's found
In the back, four   lay across the flatbed as a thin, older man,  tends to them
- Jasmine spots a  , his closes in tatters  down the highway, his arms in the air
The end has come
He speaketh his word and the end hast come
Jasmine pulls up along side him
Hop on
We're heading out to El Toro
You cannot defy what has come, it is the end
The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens
As Jasmine watches him drift away she
Still smoldering from the crash
woman can be seen inside, still alive
Jasmine jumps out
Give me a hand
Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door
Inside, the pilots have been killed, but Mrs
Whitmore, lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse
Let's get her out of here
They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the ground
Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother
She's bleeding pretty bad
Suddenly we the  of a rifle
(
) Who's got the key
Jasmine turns and see a  leveling his rifle at her
Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the gills with stolen, looted appliances
(yelling to pals) Looks like 've solved our transportation problem
Hey, you're welcome to come with us
We're leaving here anyway
We're not
Give me the key
(yelling back) Get 'em off
Two  rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance truck, pulling the injured off the tailback
(
) Repent
Sinners
Repent
The end hast come
Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming
The Redneck turns his gun on him
Back off
This ain't your business
As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket
You cannot go against the word, brother
Sure  can
The Redneck  the Tall Man
His buddies laugh
(cont'd) Now give me that key, bitch
As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts  wildly
Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key from the fireworks bag
The rocket  into the Redneck, his shirt
The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames, his cronies rush to his aid
Jasmine picks up the gun, moves in on them
This "bitch" was born in  Alabama with a Daddy who loved to hunt
(cocking the weapon) So don't think for one second that don't know how to use this
She  the rifle
Quickly the rednecks scamper away
: -  - Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve marches across the desert floor
The alien / dangles out of the parachute
Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow
He hears something, turns around
'  - Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are headed en mass towards him
Smiling, Steve signals them
The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him
Miguel leans out of his trailer
(sarcastic) Need a lift
When  flew overhead,  saw some kind of base, not far
Confused, Miguel checks his map
It's not on the map
Trust me, it's there
- Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air strip, not much
Super: Base - "Area 51", Nevada - Air Force One lands
Wheels touch down, skid
- The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled inside
The President and his entourage are met by a contingent of base personnel led by field operative,
He escorts them to a side hallway
- Lt
Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President and his entourage wait in the center of the hall
With a loud hydraulic , the entire hallway begins to  , an enormous
Why the hell wasn't  told about this place
Two words, Mr
President
Plausible deniability
General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look
When the elevator stops, a door  open
- Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of the art, sterile clean research facility
It is amazingly well staffed and organized
don't understand
Where did all this come from
How did this get funded
You didn't think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat, did you
The President shoots him a look
They are greeted by a group of  in whit coats led by,
Mr
President, 'd like to introduce you to Dr
Okun
He's been heading up our research here for the last fifteen years
Dr
Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much time in isolation
Mr
President, a real pleasure
They don't let us out much, you you
(uncomfortable) Yes
Well,  guess you'd like to see the big tamale
Follow me
They walk up a ramp at the end of the room
Large heavily enforced doors  open
- The group steps inside and nearly gasps at
Just like the one that chased Steve
The entourage stares in horror and wonder
We can  the patch-work repairs they've made on the ship over the years
She's a beaut, ain't she
Moishe leans close to David and Constance
(smug) Never any space ships recovered by the government, huh
We've had this for forty years and you don't know anything about them
Hell no, we know tons about them
The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days
The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks
David, mouth agape, just stares at it
(cont'd) See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment
But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on
The last twenty four hours have been really exciting
(exploding) People are dying out there don't think "exciting" is the word 'd choose to describe it
The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam
(calming) What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing
Not all too dissimilar to us
Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold
probably why they're interested in our planet
(suddenly excited) Hey, you wanna see them
- The lights slowly  , illuminated the vault
Okun leads the group to a sealed partition
This is vault, or as some of us have come to call it, the "freak show
" Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing
- Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks
The murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view
What we do see is not pretty
When we found them they were wearing bio-mechanical suits
Once we got them off, we were able to learn a great deal about their anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar digestive system
no vocal cords though
We're assuming they communicate with each other through other means
David cannot contain his fascination
He steps forward
What kind of other means
Hand signals, body language
Some kind of extra sensory perception
Telepathy
Can they be killed
These three died in the crash
Their bodies are as frail as our own
You just have to get past their technology, which is, 'm sorry to say, far more advanced
The President turns to David
You unlocked a part of that technology
You cracked their code
All  did was stumble onto their signal
don't know how helpful can be
Show them what you've discovered
Work together
We've got to find a way to beat them
- Four armed  watch the gate
An armada of trucks and trailers heads right for them
They move into position to block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before them
Steve stands up from the back of the pick up
Sorry, Lt
Colonel,  can't open the gates without clearance
You want to see my clearance
Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the bundled parachute in the flatbed
Steve rips the fabric aside revealing
Still unconscious, the alien stirs
The Guard  , shitting in his pants
Quickly he signals for the other to open the gate
The armada quickly drives past
Total darkness
Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open
We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all peering at us with inquisitive expressions
See the gizmos flashing
- Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing
High tech meets organic organisms
This alien ship looks familiar to our own technology and completely different at the same time
(cont'd) We've been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap
Some stuff we figured out right away
David climbs in, fascinated
He touches everything
Okun points to everything as he describes it
(cont'd) This thing we're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin, this do-hickey over here is connected with the engines, this crap
we have no idea what that stuff is for
David is transfixed by it
He stares at the small screens with flashing light patterns on them
(cont'd) But this over here is clearly what they use to navigate and guide the craft
But David still stares at the small screens
Someone grab my laptop for me
One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close
Find something interesting
Maybe
The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he quickly flips open and turns on
These patterns here, they're repeating sequentially, just like
David turns his laptop around for Okun to see
The pattern on David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen
(cont'd) their countdown signal
Their using this frequency for computer communications
It's how they co- ordinate their ships
You know, you're really starting to make us look bad
The two men exchange a smile
Another  pops his head inside
(out of breath) They got one
They got one, alive
-  51 - The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly into the hall
Okun and his staff surround it
Trailing behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel
How long has it been unconscious
Excuse me Doctor
Three hours
Get him into containment, stat
My boy is very sick, he needs immediate attention
Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall, the room begins its hydraulic
He's dying out
want him sprayed down with saline
Russell  his fist against the switch, the room stops
He a doctor nearby, gets in his face
My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma
If you don't do something about it right now he will die
Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds , meaning business
'Haver, Miller, come with me
(to Russell) Take us to him
: -   - Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls to a stop
Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face ashen
She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air Station
Tears begin to roll from her eyes
We follow her gaze to see
- The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the fire burning itself to extinction
Jasmine is devastated
: 51   - General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency
You knew all about this
When were you planning on informing the rest of us
It had been deemed classified
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived
You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots
Just then the President enters along with Constance and some other
He examines a paper map of the United States, tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed
(composing himself) And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft
Worth, And Memphis
The President and his team take seats at the large conference table
(cont'd) We've learned that  and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out
We were next
They knew exactly where and how to hit us
Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki
And our forces
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir
(beat) If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours
We're being exterminated
The room is quiet
Constance runs her fingers through her hair
The door to the room opens and Lt
Mitchell enters with Steve
Mr
President, this is Lt
Colonel Steven Hill
The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking Steve's hand
Lieutenant, congratulations
Thank you, sir
Where is the prisoner now
We have him in isolation
The doctors are very hopeful he will survive
'd like to see him
Yes, sir
The General is concerned but the President is determined
They head for the door
(to General Grey) General, 'm anxious to get back to El Toro
Didn't anyone tell you
'm sorry
El Toro was destroyed in the attack
Steve is shattered, he had no idea
: - The injured are gathered around a small camp fire
Jasmine walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods
These should last us a while
As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain
Jasmine rushes to her aid
The color from her face drained, Margaret looks like she's taking a turn for the worse
Don't move
Stay still
Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan curled up next to Boomer, too adorable
Slowly he starts to wake up
Your son
He's my angel
Was his father stationed here
He wasn't his father
was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though
Jasmine becomes sad, remembering
Margaret changes the subject
So, what do yo do for a living
'm a dancer
Really
Ballet
(laughs) No
Exotic
Oh
Sorry
Don't be
'm not
It's good money
(re: Dylan) 'Side, he's worth it
The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret
And when the dancing's over
What about your future
Funny, it used to scare me when thought about the future
(looking around) Guess it doesn't really matter anymore
Dylan comes walking over
Dylan, come here
want you to meet the First Lady
(surprised) thought you didn't recognize me
Didn't want to say anything voted for the other guy
: - Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature
His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining table
For the first time we get a good look at the head of this creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the face
The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords
Everyone ready
The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other
At the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the interlocked cords
As the cords unravel, we  that this is in fact a bio-mechanical  as we
Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue, alien's skin
Do we have life support monitors recording
#2 Yes
If we fuck up it'll all be on tape
Can we get some ventilation in here
can't take this smell
#2 They've conquered space travel but not b
o
As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly grabs his forehead
#1 You all right
Yeah
It's just that stink gives me a headache
#2 He's moving
Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the alien as it moves beneath the sheet
Unseen by the others the alien creature's Another   hits Okun who , stumbling backwards grabbing his head
The others turn in surprise
Suddenly  up, the restraining straps
Before Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles  her across the face
She is sent sprawling backwards
- Standing before her
In a wink of an eye, he , leaping on her
Together they  back into a formaldehyde tank
Hoses are ripped from their sides and  pours out
We get quick glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them
- Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall
They turn and enter the Medical lab
- The group slows as they enter the room
They see the containment room through the glass is covered with white steam
Nothing can be seen
It's eerily quiet
Cautiously they approach
Suddenly Okun is the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around him
Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry
/ Release
me
Open the door
Get him out of there
Suspicious, General Grey stops him
Wait
(to Okun) Can you hear me
/ Will kill
release me
Now
They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling of the containment tank
Suddenly the alien  , startling them, landing before them behind the glass
We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre creature
Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by it at the same time
51 - Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside, Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac
transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area
Steve runs up to it and climbs inside
- Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off rushes over to the cockpit
(yelling) What the hell are you doing
Get out of there
'm just going to borrow it
The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim
No you're not, sir
You really want to shoot me
Steve stares the Soldier down
Reluctantly he lowers his gun
Shit
'm gonna catch the hell for this
Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then
Quickly the bird   and darts off into the night
- The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking with the alien
The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's dummy
Why did you people come here
/ Air
water
your "sun
" Where do your people come from
(no answer) Where is your home
/ Here
now
And before here
/ Many worlds
Can we negotiate a truce
is there room for co-existance
(no answer) Can there be peace between us
/ Peace
No peace
What do you want us to do
/ Die
The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President
Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain
Mr
President
/ We kill you
all
The pain becomes more severe and the President
There is general panic as people rush to the President's side
(to Mitchell) Is that glass bullet proof
No sir
The General draws his pistol
Mitchell and the other military officers follow his lead
Simultaneously they all begin to The glass  into a billion pieces
The Alien is cut to ribbons, falling backwards
The President collapses
So does Okun
rushes over to Okun, checks his pulse
He's dead
General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers
Mr
President, are you okay
Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye
He wanted me to understand
He communicated with me
(turning to Grey) They're like locusts
They travel from planet to planet, their whole civilization
After they've consumed every natural resource they move on
And we're next
The President stands with a new resolve
He stares at the dead alien on the floor
(cold) Prepare a nuclear strike
- The research staff are working near the recovered alien attacker
Constance comes rushing in
She looks around for David
Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him
- Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small refrigerator as Constance enters
Just my luck, no ice
take it you've heard
toast to the end of the world
David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig
He didn't come to this decision lightly
David nods, he doesn't want to argue
He smiles cynically
You still believe in him
He's a good man
Better be
You left me for him
wanted a career
Didn't you ever want to be part of something special
David stares daggers at her
was part of something special
Constance realizes he means their marriage
She's hurt him and can see it
She turns and leaves
: - black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night
As we pass some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is, in fact, a -2 As we , we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of eight
These mighty winged giants fly together in attack formation

Signals coming in low
The President's group takes their position behind the technicians

Still there is no answer
Mr

Suddenly it
The bomber
-2   - We see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target
She's away
- On the big map we see one  target line tracking the missile as it approaches Houston
(to himself) May our children forgive us
-   - The Tank Commander readjusts the periscope
-   & -2 We follow the Cruise Missile as it guides itself on a direct collision course with the space craft
- The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on top of the target
Everyone in the room holds their breath
- The nuke speeds closer
It  the protective shield and - With the -2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind it vanishes in a   , blinding us
- We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map, tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston
(excited) It's a hit
The others are still waiting
The monitor shows the night vision picture of the growing   rising above the city
-  - The   engulfs the horizon
- Rocked by the massive explosion, the shock wave  the armored tank but doesn't destroy it
- The men inside are  around, hard from the explosion
- We got the bastards
General Grey shoots Nimziki a look
The President holds up a hand, silencing the room
Can they see it
Did it destroy the target
'    - As the cloud begins to dissipate we see , completely unharmed
- Negative
Target remains
- On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain
The air is let out of the room, everyone deflated
Call them back
The other bombers might have more luck
We shouldn't just give up
said call them back
As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks into a depression
His last hope of survival gone
: - Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the last flames of their campfire
From the worried expression on Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her wounds bleeding badly
kicks up, the sound of an  approaching
Jasmine squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a engulfs her
'  -  - Bright lights in the sky growing nearer
Slowly the others begin to wake up, frightened as the lights
The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring defiantly
smile creeps across her face as she sees that the lights belong to
The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out, racing towards Jasmine
Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his arms
You're late
You know how  like to make a big entrance
They kiss
: - The double doors burst open as the President carrying his young daughter marches through
Doctor  comes over to them
How is she
'm sorry, Mr
President
If only we could have gotten to her sooner
The President puts his daughter down as he sees
'  - Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her
Patricia rushes over
She's bleeding internally
There's nothing else we can do
Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother
Hiya Munchkin
Mommy, we were worried
We didn't know where you were
'm right here, baby
Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the room
As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to his wife and daughter
Honey, why don't you wait outside so Mommy can get some rest
Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves
Out of sight, Margaret winces, fading away
The President grabs her hand for support
She squeezes tightly
(through tears) 'm scared, Tom
It's okay
The doctors said you're going to be just fine
Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well
Liar
The look between them says more than any words
-  '  - The President exits the room, overcome with emotion
Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort him
He holds them off with a gesture
He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall
He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them
'm so sorry
just wanted to thank you
You're a very brave woman
Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting
Whitmore walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child
Is Mommy sleeping now
Yes, baby
Mommy's sleeping
: Topples over with a
foot steps in and starts kicking trash all over
51 - David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic mess
Moishe comes up behind, restraining him
David, David
What the hell are you doing
'm making a mess
This  can see
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops
Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone
Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore
David, you're drunk
David slips, falls on his ass, hard
Moishe helps him back up on his feet
think you better sleep this off
Go back inside before you catch a cold
Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea
Pops, you're a genius
What'd  say
cold
Of course
Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside
: - large crowd has been gathered here at the lab
General Grey and Nimziki walk up to Constance
All right, Connie, we're here
What's this all about
really have no idea
He just said to bring everyone down here
Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft
Does that thing fly in outer space
Steve loos up at the craft admiringly
It certainly does
When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks on the hatch door on the alien attacker
The door swings open and David climbs down
Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places the empty can on top of the alien attacker
David turns and faces the gathering
Could anyone please step back away from the craft
They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft
The Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him loud  emits from the craft
David has to yell over it
Lt
Mitchell, would you mind drawing your pistol
What
From where you're standing, do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft
Mitchell shrugs affirmatively
David gestures for him to try
Taking aim, Mitchell
The bullet  off the attacker's protective shield
Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the errant bullet
Sorry 'bout that
You see, it's protected by the craft's shields
We can't penetrate their defenses
We know that already
What's your point
David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the craft by cables and starts typing furiously
My point is if we can't beat their defenses, then we must get around them
David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently counting down
Lt
Mitchell, would you please try to shoot it again
Reluctantly Mitchell obliges
This time the can is Everyone in the room is shocked
The Technician re-opens the craft's door and the loud  disappears
How did you do that
gave it a cold
The President is fascinated, he steps closer
Moishe beams proudly at his smart son
Constance is amazed
(cont'd) More accurately,  gave it a virus
computer virus
David turns his laptop around for the President to see
Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields
Just as they used our satellites against us, we can use their own signal against them
David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the smaller alien attackers
(cont'd) If we plant the virus directly into the mother ship, it would then filter down into all the corresponding ships below
And just how do we infect the "Mother Ship" with a virus
David gestures to the alien attacker behind him
We'll have to fly their craft out of our atmosphere and dock with the mother ship
Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker, sizing it up
David points to a satellite photo of the underbelly of the Mother Ship
(cont'd) We can enter here, upload the virus and set off an explosion that could disable it
This would disorient the smaller ship below and buy you some time to take them out
Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan
This is ridiculous
How long would their shields be down
Once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes
You want us to co-ordinate a massive world wide counter strike with a window of only a few minutes
With their shields down it might be possible
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you
We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign
(gesturing to the alien ship) Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate
(
) wouldn't say that, sir
Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd
've seen them in action
've watched their maneuvers
With your permission, sir, 'd like the opportunity to try
That thing's a wreck
It crash landed back in the fifties
We don't even know if it's capable of flying
David turns to the Technicians
Remove the clamps
Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of the craft
With a loud , the clamps are pulled away
For a moment the hulking craft  unevenly, but quickly stabilizes,
Any other questions
Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder
Let's do it
- Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the hall
Nimziki rushes to catch up
understand that you're upset over the death of your wife but that's no excuse for making another fatal mistake
The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and  him against the wall
Holding him tight, the President gets in his face
The only mistake  made was appointing a sniveling little weasel like you Chief of Staff
Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her
(cont'd) But this is a mistake,  am thankful to say,  do not have to live with
Mr
Nimziki, you're fired
The President releases him and turns to General Grey
(cont'd) Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them
Yes, Sir
He storms off leaving everyone stunned
He can't do that
(amazed) He just did
: - Four    are gathered around a table going over a map
One pilot, , is in charge
we've been told that there may be additional re-enforcement in hiding near the Golan Straights
Suddenly the flap to the tent opens
All the pilots draw their pistols frightening the   who stands in the doorway
The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic
What the hell's he saying
(explaining) Seems they're getting a signal
One Morse code
- As they step out of the tent we  more than a from different nations parked around them
They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided into many smaller camps
Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through the many other campsites
Thomson gets some stares from the still get believe this
The Iraqis don't appear altogether too pleased with this arrangement
How do you think the Israelis feel
Sure enough a campsite of   sits very near by
- Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the Morse code comes through
Thomson quickly kneels down, taking notes
It's from the Americans
They want to organize a counter offensive
It's about bloody time
What do they plan to do
-  - Several Russian Pilots are gathered around a radio, their dozen   standing behind them
#1 (subtitled) They claims to be able to bring down their shields
#2 When do they want to attack
-  - At the base of a large Volcano in Fuji, several Japanese attack helicopters stand near their pilots, gathered around a radio
(subtitled) The attack begins in thirteen hours
: 51 -   - large world map has been constructed
Several sites are marked with stickers reading:
Another sticker is put onto Mr
Fuji
Striding in, the President surveys the war room
General Grey rushes over to meet him
How're we doing
Better than we thought
General Grey leads the President over to the wall map
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world
Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready
And our troops here
We've been collecting planes from all over but
But what, General
Pilots, sir
We don't have enough people to get them in the air
Then find them
: - Troy is sleeping peacefully in his bed
Russell sits at the kitchen table as Miguel enters
How' he doing
Just fell asleep
He's gonna be just fine
Join me in a little celebration
Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels
Clearly he's been drinking again
Miguel is crestfallen
Pissed he turns and storms out
Miguel
Don't be mad
Miguel
Drunkenly, Russell chases after him
51 -   - Making his way through the campers, Russell  a group of refugees around some   who addresses them
(through megaphone) We're planning to launch a counter offensive
Russell wanders over towards them
(cont'd) with our depleted manpower we must ask that anyone with any flight experience come forward
Military training is preferable but anyone who can fly a plane could be useful
Russell pushes his way through the crowd
(slurred) can fly,  mean, 'm a pilot
The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in his hand
Sorry, sir
Russell gets into his face, desperate
You don't understand
've gotta be part of this
This is important to me
They ruined my life
Why don't you go somewhere and sleep it off
The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them
Russell watches them go, dejected
Angrily, he throws the bottle of Jack,  it
- large  slides back into a  that has been attached to the top of the alien attacker
Some workers over the patch-work repairs
Below, Mitchell briefs Steve and David
We've hid the launcher in the ship's manifold
Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by
(cont'd) This will be attached to the ships main console
It's just like an  launch pad on the stealths
Exactly
Use it the same way
Only the nuke won't detonate on impact
You'll have another thirty seconds to get as far away as you can
'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter
(checking his watch) Oh shit, we're late
We'll meet you there
Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker
Constance has been eavesdropping
She walks to David
Thirty seconds
Isn't that cutting it a little too close
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off
David leans under the attacker where a  is attaching another device
It's the strongest  transmitter we could get
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus
Then cross your fingers the shields go down
David turns and walks away, Constance following
With you
don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission
If anything goes wrong 'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows
David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle
" (smiling) You know how 'm always trying to save the planet
This is my chance
David rushes off
Constance watches him leave
(to herself) Now he gets ambitious
- Jasmine is kneeling as Dylan tries to zip up the back of her dress
It's too tight
had to borrow it
guess that's good enough
Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan
How do  look
She looks great
But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand gesture
You're a lot of help
The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in
You're late
You know me
know, you like to make a big entrance
Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand
Before we do this,  want you to know 'm sorry
Sorry for what
(serious) should have done this a long long time ago
(
) Do you have the ring
As we   we see that we are in a military , a large crucifix on the wall
stands by the altar
You bet
Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring
Witnesses
Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking seats on opposing sides of the aisle
Then let's get this show on the road
Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar
Jasmine is radiant
Dylan rushes up and joins them
As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant glance
Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows
: - - Slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes that have been gathered
Pilots, flights crews and refugees prepare for the battle
51 -  - - Walking out the President scans the motley collection of planes; old, new, high-tech, low-tech
Beggars can't be choosers, sir
Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and file
Slowly they turn their attention to the President
Good morning
In less than one hour planes from here and all around the world will launch the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind
(beat) Mankind
The word has new meaning for all of us now
We are reminded not of our petty differences but of our common interests
Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening
Even David is moved
(cont'd) Perhaps it's fate that today, July the Fourth, we will once again fight for our freedom
Not from tyranny, persecution or oppression
But from annihilation
We're fighting for our right to live, to exit
From this day on, the fourth day of July will no longer be remembered as an American holiday but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not go quietly into the night
We will not vanish without a fight
We will live on
We will survive
The crowd erupts into applause and cheers
The President turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of clothes
General Grey confronts the President as he begins to disrobe
Mr
President, just what do you think you're doing
'm a pilot, Will
This is where belong
General Grey wants to argue but can't
- Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan
When 'm back we'll light those fireworks
Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David
David, take these
David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand
Thanks, Pops
want you should know, 'm very proud of you, son
That means more to David than Moishe could have known
Be careful
Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out
Damn it
We can't go yet gotta find some cigars
Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two cigars from his coat pocket
My last two
With my blessings
You're a lifesaver
Steve grabs them and climbs inside
David smiles awkwardly, then follows Steve
- The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands him one of the cigars
Hang on to this
For our victory dance
But not 'til we hear the fat lady sing
Reluctantly David takes it
As he does Steve notices the "barf bag" on David's lap
Off Steve's look
have a confession to make
'm not real big on flying
Great
- Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off
Part of the ceiling suddenly  , revealing an enormous leading topside
'   - Strapping in and securing their equipment, Steve grabs hold of the throttle
You ready
Let' rock and roll
Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings - The Alien Attacker   into the rear of the lab
Moishe winces as the others react fearfully
'   - Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle
Oops
Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written "post it" card is pasted onto the dash
Steve reaches over and turns it upside down, righting the problem
Let's try that again
This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker ahead
- Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker out of the underground laboratory
51 -  - With a  the Alien Attacker  out of the underground shaft and  into the sky
Once high enough it goes into a wild barrel roll
'   - Just as it comes out of the roll
What the hell are you doing
Just getting a feel for her
-   - The Attacker arcs upward and disappears into the clouds
51 -  '  - The President watches the Attacker flying away
His canopy locks down as he adjusts his helmet
Grey, you read me
(filtered) Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course
- General Grey is standing by the large map tracking the alien ships over the United States
(filtered) Where's it headed
think our secret is out
They're headed right for us
'  - (filtered) thirty six minutes
The President gets a determined look in his eye
He his engine
Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock down and planes taxi to position
-   - The captured alien attacker soars higher and higher
'  - Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag
" You still with me
David nods sheepishly
Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere
(to himself) 've waited a long time for this
The ship begins to , rattling harshly as it climbs
Through the window we  the blue sky
Slowly a field of  take its place
This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life
He's not disappointed
David, however, is not so thrilled
-   '  - Heading further into space,  overhead
'  - Through the windshield we see a huge  floating in the distance, the moon behind it
That's it
Head straight for it
But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls
Something's happening
It's not responding
David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on board computers
Th signal is
(thrilled) was counting on that
They're bringing us in
- The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack formation
We have visual
- The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range headed straight for us
(filtered) Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered
Roger
- Constance is standing by Lt
Mitchell behind the Military cadre coordinating the battle
What if that thing gets here before we can plant the virus
The entire compound is buried deep within the mountain
It should give us some protection
But what about all the people outside
Mitchell shoots her a worried look
Quickly they both dash outside
- Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother Ship
Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the Mother Ship through the many triangular portals
Steve and David's attacker's drawn into one of them
-   - Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal shaft leading into this planet sized space craft
They pass by enormous windows revealing the    working within the Mother Ship
We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity stretching out beyond visibility
Enormous  are scattered throughout
'  - Neither can believe their eyes
Staring out the front window they
' Below them    can be seen as they are marched into dozens of enormous   docked at the edges of the parade grounds
Must be thousands of them
What are they doing
Looks like they're preparing the invasion
-   - They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many
Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one
In the center of the Landing are large  , inside is a kind of control tower
We can  several through the glass
Steve and David's attacker is heading straight towards them
This won't work
They'll see before we can do anything
Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David pushes the button underneath
These things are fully equipped
Reclining bucket seats, power windows
lowers covering the window
Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking which  , holding it in place
We're in
David starts typing frantically

He's uploading the virus

He grabs the bag for her
Alicia smiles
Miguel helps Troy down from the trailer
As they rush away, Miguel turns to Philip
Where's Russell
-  - Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the refugees into the compound
Hurry, we've got to get everyone inside
Constance looks up and  off in the distance
Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant mountain
Headed this way
'  - David finishes typing
The screen on his laptop flashes: The virus is in
All we can do now is pray
-   - (filtered) Delivery complete
Engage
Roger
The fighter jets   and overtake the smaller planes in front of them
Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a long range  Missile  , computes its target and - Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing visual from the Present's Plane
They  the missile moving towards target
Keep your fingers crossed
- The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target
Come on, baby
- Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile
The shields are still up
- They watch the missile blow up harmlessly
Deflated, General Grey grabs his mic
It didn't work
Disengage
Sir, get your people out of there

Not yet
Below his plane another  drops down, and

It moves in closer and closer
Suddenly it , rips off a part of the side of this immense ship

As the last of them enter the hangar,    arrive behind them, the ground
The rows of trailers homes  one after another

Packed into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of the nearby explosions
As the last one is safely inside, Constance turns back and

Constance is  back against the wall
She activates the elevator and the room begins to

Suddenly the large window slowly begins to
What're you doing
It's not me
They're overriding the system
The blast shield continues to peel away
David and Steve drop down below the dash, hiding from view
As the view becomes unobstructed we
-   - Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay window of the Landing's control tower
Damn
David leans from his hiding position and  several other alien attackers are moving in on them
They are surrounded Check and mate

Miguel moves through the refugees, searching for Russell
Yarmulke is unfolded
As it is lifted we realize Moishe is putting it on
He holds the hands with the people around him and begins to pray
Nimziki moves next to Moishe
Moishe takes his hand

This could be our last night on Earth

If we do, we'll both die virgins
But at last we'll be together
Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last
51 -   - The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the attackers
Below the  begins to open

We're running out of missiles, Sir
We're just not causing enough damage

Taking the advice, the President
He's met by two flanking Fighters ( 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly of the City Destroyer
Sure enough, the  is opening, preparing to fire the

Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and Patricia, holding them tight

Russell smiles at b being called "Dad

Russell turns off his radio as he banks  towards the open

Let's nuke 'em
David realizes they're both about to die
He stares at the cigar
(re: cigar) Funny,  always thought things like these would kill me
They share a quick sober laugh
Nice meeting you
You as well
Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's
Ready
