"Hudson Hawk", by Steven
de Souza, revised by Daniel Waters Screenplay by Steven
de Souza Revisions by Dan Waters Based on an original idea by Bruce Willis & Robert Kraft Silver Pictures/Flying Heart Films      June 14, 1990 Production : " " : -  - Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented and roaring puppets is unfolding
and their families rumble with enjoyment at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment
Encircled by children, elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule
As he begins to juggle, a is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap
Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up
Leonardo, che pazzo
The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle
where the charismatic    laughs down at him
Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun- glasses with his trademark beard
He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses
Removing his shades, Da Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible machine
The opening   its dazzling idio- syncrasies
haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular Machine
Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance laser show
(silencing authority) Basta vapore
The apprentice throws a lever
shunt near the furnace turns
Steam escapes upwards
The machine immediately slows down
Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for- ward with tongs
-   ' comes to a trembling, mystical halt
Right behind this trough is a    as intricately modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more dazzling in beauty
It gleams like a jewel in the yellow glow which pours from a    into a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat
The tongs enter the frame
Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face
murmur goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master peers at the smoking yellow bar
Maestro, che meraviglia
Lei e' proprio fantastico
Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit
Lasciatemi, solo
Solo
The apprentices scurry out
Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes
'ho fatto
Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop
' With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop, sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the other
His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large  of sketches, the inkwell nearby; a  of what looks like a ; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies
Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work- shop casually tinkering with various experiments
He snaps his fingers at a   , wearing a diving helmet prototype
The Apprentice jumps into a pool of water
Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished- except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens to be seated in a stool before the easel
She broadly smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch
Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a sails past Leonardo in a bat winged glider, enthusiastically shouting
Da Vinci grins back until he touches his pocket
He pulls out the crystal and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate mirror
He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable geometric pieces
Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the table in his workshop
He ponders then looks back out to the Vinci vista
The bat winged glider  into: who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison
The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over the face of    causing him to break out of an eye-closed trance
Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall
, One  and , the other and  march down a cell block
The Former is smoking a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter
We're losing our biggest celebrity today
You're kidding, Petey the Paint Thinner Killer is getting paroled
Not that slime, you Fizzhead
Hudson Hawk
The last of the great cat burglars
hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and a  , identically dressed in black cat burglar gear
The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward
As a thief, Hawk was a poem
Iambic fucking pentameter
You know, Crime used to have a little class
hundred reporters were here when he came in, now they're probably out covering some tired crack gang war
The Guards approach Hawk's cell
Hawk, with his back turned, hefts on a nifty blazer
Remind me to fire my publicist
The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with his key-ring
Darn, these are for -block
Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket
Then the lighter from the Young Guard's pocket--  the fabric fuzz with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to the door
- go back down to security and- He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open
The Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts past them, down the hall
The Guards hustle to catch up
The wise guard puts his finger in the air and sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating from Hawk
Guess this means, Hawk, you'll be able to let yourself back in
Never happen
Bet
Ten bucks
Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling
Hawk unfolds the painting
Oh, give this back to Petey in block
Tell him it was a sweet gift, but  think he got some wrong ideas about our friendship
The Paint Thinner Killer did this
think you picked a good day to get out
The trio comes to the final checkpoint
Hawk takes a deep breath
Hope  lose the bet
Have that cappuccino on me
(flipping him the pipe cleaner) You got it
double
-- Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall between him and freedom
As music crescendos and Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two Mafioso brothers,  and  , the latter sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln Continental
Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back attitude, his scumbag brother is not
Welcome back, buddy ol' pal
We've got a proposition
Answer's no, not even if you bathe
Cesar Mario, Antony Mario, how's the "Family
"  Kill any monkeys lately
How many times do  have to say it
didn't put the hit on Little Eddie
Never had anything against that kooky chimp actually found him, "endearing
" Sure
Face down
Two endearing shots to the back of the head
That's your mark, man
What did Little Eddie ever do to
Smouldering, Hawk struts off
Cesar takes a black canvas bag from a   and hustles up to Hawk
The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding on the hood
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House
Easy as my brother's wife
Directions are in the bag
Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie
Or you cut off my thingie
Directions even your brother would understand
(defensively) Yeah, directions even  could understand
The car squeals to a stop
Antony bounds off
Cesar shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling hands
Hawk, you're a great thief
Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of
Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, 'd say kiss my ass
But considering your status, 'll say slurp my butt
Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into Cesar's hands
What's your favorite sport, Hawk
Baseball, why
Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says "Baseball
"  He is handed a baseball bat
Hawk backs up as Antony moves threateningly toward him
meant, ping pong
Listen, 'd rather go back in than whore for you
(stopping) Oh,  need to borrow ten dollars
from above turns as not to be a witness
Hawk feebly calls up to him
Help
Police
Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until the last second
Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf
Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch
Hawk boots up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat of the car
(unfazed) You need some time to think
That's cool, but next time, 'm not going to say "Please
" Cesar floats into the backseat
The Lincoln takes off
Hawk seethes
don't believe this
've been out forty seconds
rings out
Hawk hits the ground, thinking it is a gunshot
'
gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too- fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out
Hawk looks up to see  , his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best friend
That's the first thing  did
Smooch the ground and taste the freedom
Sorry  was late
Miss anything
(getting up) Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable
Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day
Lousy day
The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day
What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant
Believe me, it's overrated
Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex
Where's the kiss
No tongue this time,  promise
laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before getting in the car
Looks like you've been expanding your
Don't say it, Hawkins
'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure
My next word was gonna be "consciousness
"  Swear to God
tubby
-- The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view
"Come Fly With Me" is playing on the radio
Hawk casually com- pletes an intimidating hand puzzle
That's your definition of "Hard
" Show off
Hey, boss tune
"Come Fly with Me
" Three minutes, 51 seconds
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and 'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg-- Not anymore
Now 'm the laziest damn cat burg--'m going to take it so straight that  won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do
Statue of Liberty
Entertain some ladies
Miss Saigon tix
Seduce some women
Play Nintendo
Bone some chicks
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's
Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me
God, 'd kill for a damn cappuccino
What the hell's a Nintendo
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees
Who's your buddy
Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag
The man knows, the man knows
Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff
So Mr
Coffee, what went down outside the prison
Oh, not much
Mario Brothers want me to do a job
Alex brakes and cappuccino flies
Hawk half-heartedly tries to lick up with his fingers
Those dago-guinea- can say this shit 'm Italian-wop motherfu-- Ah, had the perfect amount of foam
Just get me to the bar
It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change
' -- The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the bar
The Empire State Building beams in the background
Sinatra cuts off
' -- It's changed
Hawk and Alex enter into what has become the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare, packed with noisy,  -
violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon elevated
sets set up all around the place
Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening toasting wine coolers, and two very   high- fiving each other after missing a dartboard
didn't know how to tell you couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night
Next thing  know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month
"  Now, 'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper
read about these people in Newsweek
Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe
Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph
Captain Bob's steering wheel
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino
gotta go be a boss
Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it
Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out
This is Pizza
Reindeer Goat cheese
admit, 've been known to go wild and order a Canadian Bacon in my time, but
Hawk lights up a cigarette
- immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes,  mind if you smoke" button
- Can you read
smoker
Can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with dew
- (Huh
) No
The Candy Man can, Felix
You know,  thought this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a
Guess 'm wrong
Maybe that's why  became a serial arsonist
- Hey, it's okay, big guy
Smoke all you want
Have mine
The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and flees
cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the bar saloon-style
smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his lips until a   swirls into frame and splashes into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer
(
) You're under arrest
Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and cackling island of a man,  , amid the sea of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by a table
Have a seat
Good to see you, buddy ol' pal
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates
With concern, Alex watches Hawk sit at Gates' table
' Gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with terrifying precision
Hawk tosses the badge onto the food
Gates eats around it
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect
Especially after  got you such a nice job
What job
Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the table
The auction house, asshole
One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been
No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey
It's a great deal,  can't lie
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free
know  was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes
You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute
Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer down at Hawk
Behind Gates, on the
screens, are analogous images of
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me
did dog and pony for you
You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges
How was  supposed to know they were women
Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly
" Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself
Yes
Remember that shoe you lost
Uh, yeah
Cut to the chase
Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table
One phone call and your shoe will become a piece of evidence and that suicide'll become a murder
Hawk bobs under the table and up
What else do you got under there don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame
That's the beauty
It's bullshit, but  can make it stick because 'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con
Alex suddenly approaches the table
How is everything tonight, sir
Beat it, Alex
You're a dinosaur
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here
Sure
That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon
(mouthful) You're full of shit
As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens
No, man, actually you are
Just add water and it makes its own gravy
Keeps your teeth healthy and your coat shiny
Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging
Hawk gets up to laugh next to Alex
Their laughter dies as they turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table between them
-- Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street
Behind him, Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag
Sinatra's "Witchcraft" blares on the radio
Hmmmm
Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing
look at this
Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old, "true" bar
Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk and the Regs at the bar
Managing a weary smile, Hawk lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of granny classes and pulls out blueprints
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel
Remember when the Captain
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th
Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it behind his back
He brings it back around, completed
Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp
Alex starts rubbing his stomach
They pace in pre-job syncopation and speak rapid-fire
The safe's a Simpson 71
Last time  played the game, Simpson only had a 40
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce
You re still the best,  know it
But you got three guards who
Shit, what am  doing
Where's the want ads
Gonna sell some spatulas
Hey, 'm sorry, man
'm putting out a fire with kerosene
Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs
This isn't funny
'm not into this
There goes five seconds
My record's eighteen
You're not
Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little wounded
'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers
Goddamn Gates
Goddamn Rutherford Auction House
By the way, how many seconds
Rutherford Auction
that name
Alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain
Alex
Don't wet your diapers
'll have to change them
"Witchcraft
" What's the running time
Alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of drawings of different kinds of vaults
He sets himself up for an insulin injection
3:48
can't get you involved, man
This is my sewage and
(re drawings) God, you love all this, don't you, you bastard
Haven't you ever heard of stamp collecting, or curling
Hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to Alex
'm in
Have you seen the public service announcements for Diabetes
We can ride horses, play LaCrosse, and knock off auction houses got a plan
You won't have to hail Cesar or Gates
Hawk collapses next to Alex, resigned to his fate
'm a bum

They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft

The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to a Dispenser on the corner
The Bums wheel around the truck
The Driver loads the papers and bounds back
The Truck pulls away from the corner
The shopping cart rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen
The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their necks
The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge that connects the Auction House with another Building
Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them- selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes beneath
The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk and Alex
Getting a footing, on the small window ledge, each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a plunger
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that
Hey, you promised
Don't worry, 'm wearing my girdle
-- Hawk and Alex come through their window holes
Hawk immediately flattens himself against a wall, whisper- ing
Cameras
No need
Guards' station's right there
Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where laughter and shadows emerge
Hawk tries to flee, but a grinning Alex pulls him toward it
Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room marked , which is right next to the open Guards' Station
The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and Alex lock-picking into the Power room to
' Two Security Guards sit before a console of seven security screens still chuckling over an unheard joke
Wires coming out of the security console run across the floor and through the wall into
The wires go up to a row of seven humming,  button flashing

Hawk and Alex stand before them, sharing a cig
They record everything their video surveillance takes in
Yes, master-thief,  can see that
You said something about a plan
Alex presses the  buttons on the

Am  boring you, smartass
Watch
little rewind and re-wire action and the Guards are going to be watching a rerun and miss out on our exciting episode
Alex pulls from a nearby shelf six tapes marked
-- Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard,  , moseys through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium
The auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a turbo Floor Washer
Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon a comparatively    and begins to tip back and snooze
' The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze
Check out Big Stan
(walkie-talkie) Big Stan
Startled by his walkie-talkie, Big Stan falls back on the little chair, crunching it to the ground
The laughing security guards see the crunch
Alex puts the last of the Monday tapes into a
You got about five minutes and change
5:32
"Swinging on a Star
" You know they invented something while you were inside
Called a watch
freight elevator pings
Hawk opens it up as the music of "Swinging on the Star" kicks in on the soundtrack
" mule is an animal with long funny ears
" "He kicks up at anything he hears
Hawk crams himself into the freight elevator with his Glad bag
Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when Hawk isn't
Hawk takes over the song, sardined in the elevator
"Or would you rather swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar
" Alex goes up to a Circuit Box and pulls down two large Switches
The soundtrack singers continue to warble
' The lights of the floor wobble and die
The console screens blink off
The Security Guards stop laughing
Hell-o
Check the Power room, bud
Security Guard One harrumphs into a standing position
Alex speedily hooks and rehooks the backs of the
They now all have their  buttons lit up
swing on a star, carry moonbeams
Security Guard One fishes for keys to open the power room
The soundtrack singers whisper as not to give away Alex
Alex briskly slams back up the switches
The singers go louder as the lights come back on
Security Guard One harrumphs and heads back to the Guards' Station
Hawk scrambles out of the freight elevator in the left wall of the Auditorium, glancing to the clock
"Or would you rather be a fish
" He pulls out the black canvas bag from his Glad bag and takes out the blueprints
Hawk follows them toward the painting on-stage
' Big Stan comes up from behind his fellow guards, dumping the remains of the chair on the floor
(moving back off) Very funny
The Seventh Floor Screen shows a peaceful auction auditorium
And the Blue Chair
--
From the exact angle, the viewer sees the current state of the room with Hawk flinging off the painting of the horseback children, revealing a safe
But no Blue chair
spits on the rubber cup of an electronic sensor, plugged into a Walkman, and affixes it to the safe above the dial
(lyric trouble) " fish is annuh nan na nan na brook
Alex is now packed into the freight elevator
"He can't write his name or read a book
To fool people is his only thought
" (remembering) "And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
" Wearing headphones, Hawk cranks up the Walkman and spins the dial
The  from the dial are so loud he winces and turns down the volume
Then there's a
' With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips a cup of coffee
He doesn't swallow
His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh screen
He looks to the chair remains, then back again
Uh, Jerry

What the
You think that's weird, check out screen two
Screen Two shows hatching open some on-duty beers, going down a hall
Guard Two looks to the empties atop the console
Somebody rewired the recorders
Hawk ditches his accessories and swings the safe door open
Inside the safe, along with the "holy" Da Vinci music cue, is the clay equestrian model from Leonardo's worktable
Hawk belts out as he put it in the black canvas bag
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

) "Every day you meet quite a few

You could be swinging on a star

' Suddenly, on the seventh screen, the image and voices of Hawk and Alex in-process comes on
Shit, let's roll
Hawk puts the painting back up, but stops to stare at the playful children
The song's over
Come on
"You could be swinging on a star
" What am  doing here
There are so many things  wanna do that aren't this
Paint a lighthouse
Kiss a woman in Italy

Life is
Hawk's soliloquy is cut short as Security Guards One and Two crash into the auction auditorium
() "You could be swinging on a star
" You couldn't have waited to see a psychiatrist
No, you had
Alex whips his chair at the floor washer, tipping it forward and causing its electrical cord to pull up and trip the Guards into a bellyflop
Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them into Alex's thumbcuffs
He then limbos under their connected arms and springs over the outstretched washer cord
The Security Guards clumsily turn and re-trip themselves
Let's go down the freight elevator
Big Stan suddenly unhatches from the freight elevator
Keep those ideas coming
Hawk and Alex run toward an office located at the right wall
They both do a Gene-Kellyesque-chair-tip-over before simultaneously bashing through the office door
Hawk and Alex stop in the office to painfully laugh and rub their funny bones
Alex stops laughing
'm not as unpleasantly plump as that Guard am
Big Stan fires off a warning shot
Hawk and Alex quickly tear up a window
Moving out on to a ledge, Hawk and Alex look down to the huge auction house awning and trade gulps
Big Stan wobbles into the mouth of the office door
got a bad feeling
can't even swim
Hell, the fall'll probably kill ya
Big Stan raises his gun
Hawk and Alex jump and  down the face of the building
Closer and closer to the awning
The viewer focuses upon Hawk as he free-falls
: -- Hawk continues his "fall" into a ridiculously huge reclining chair
The foot stand swooshes out with a thump
pulls away the canvas bag with a cackle
-- Hawk's weirdly reclining viewpoint makes Gates and his pad more grotesque than they are (No small feat
) sub-Radio Shack stereo coughs next to a scary punch bowl of red, margarita-like substance, beneath the instantly recognizable framed picture of Those Dogs Playing Poker, all atop a Jungle Shag
Gates, in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt-over-a- '--shirt, raises a loud tumbler with one hand, the black canvas bag in the other
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor
How about a Gates-arita
(toward bowl) used real hot dogs
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown
Suddenly a light is turned on in the corner, revealing a seated Cesar and Antony Mario, the latter taking a painful Gatesirita sip
Good job, not pretty, but good
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do  know how to party or what
Gates pulls out the horse and looks at it
All this trouble for a horsey
may not know art, but  know what  like
(to Dog picture) You certainly do
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here
Any minute now, dear Mr
Gates
malevolently snobbish British Butler, , enters in distaste
He makes a stressful glance to three on a coffeetable that has a photo of a --  with the caption:
Hawk notices this
Oh, sorry Jeeves

May
Alfred takes the equestrian model and with a jeweler's loupe, studies it carefully
Ah, such craftsmanship
Leonardo Da Vinci's last commission for the Duke of Milan
Irreplaceable
Hey, Mr
French, 'm delirious for you
Now where's my cut
With dignity, Alfred  the ancient horse over Gates's head
Alfred rummages through the debris a perversely labyrinthine
(recognizable from Da Vinci's workshop)
You son-of-a
don't believe this
You come into my house
Alfred pockets the goodies, but not before Hawk can give them a confused peruse
ought to take Big Ben and shove it up your limey blimey bunghole
blade slides down Alfred's arm
Half-yawning, he
' 180 spins before Gates and the bystanders behind him
goes back up Alfred's arm
The room's only sound is the stereo's inappropriate music
Gates shrugs but his voice is off
Like  said
Where's my cu-u-
Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood begins to gush like a tourist attraction
Gates crashes down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo, sending it to the ground, cutting off the music
The Dog Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid
Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the recliner
Alfred pats some stain remover on the blood on his shirt
So much for his "cut
" (post-chortle) Excuse my dry British humor
(rising) Lovely work, Alfred, taking the Concorde back
Indeed  am, Mr
Mario
'm really racking up those frequent flyer points
hate to interrrupt you two lovebirds
You know,  think Gates promised Hawk a cut, too
The Mario brothers cackle out
Hawk tries to flail out of his chair
Alfred turns to him and flicks up his arm
Hawk sees his life pass before his eyes until he realizes Alfred is merely pulling him up off the chair
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk
(breathless) Too-do-loo, babe
' -- Hawk bursts into the bar
Alex sits on a stool, reading the paper
Did  miss anything
Oh, not much
Gates just had his tonsils taken out
The hard way
Geez, Gates was killed
Who do we send the thank you note to
Hawk does a combat jump over the bar and begins to fiddle with the cappuccino machine
The Butler did it
Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart
Dude took Mr
Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head
He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo
(professorial) Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece
Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue
consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian
Horse things
The cappuccino machine sparks
perplexed Hawk takes a couple extra seconds to back off
Okay, you got me, Mr
(holding up newspaper) Morning edition
Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight
"Attempted
"  At-tempt-ted
'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but  do have my pride
Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex,
Hawk takes the newspaper
There is a picture of the Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the "Sforza
"  Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs
Boing
Uh, this  don t understand
Why try
(hurdling the bar) Because 'm tired of not understanding things
Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out  really didn't steal--it's fucked up
(pulling back newspaper) You re not thinking of going to
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense
Where's your tux
'  -- Dressed in a not-quite-fitting but suave tuxedo, Hawk enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs all set out)
Bored  in coveralls lug equestrian items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator
fan-taas-tic example of Florentine marble
Who will start at 160,000
160,000
180,000
Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage
Hawk scans everyone in the room before coming to the one seated next to him,
All these years of attending auctions, still get goosebumps
The paintings, the sculptures
the things that aren't really paintings or sculptures
the pretentious vultures who don't even look up from their calculators to see what they're buying
Now that gives me goosebumps
Auctions are disgusting
couldn't agree more
Savages
The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself
Lot Fifteen, an equestrian sconce attributed to the Cellini school
Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area wearing a blue ribbon
Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders:  An oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan -, raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures; a    and his - , - with a    , and a scary   in a monocle and a tiara
frantically man a table of phones set up down before the stage
One raises his arm
Sold
To the caller from Newfoundland
takes out an impressive replica of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings it to the Auctioneer
The crowd a-a-hs
Hawk laughs and shakes his head
And finally, Lot number 17, thought to be lost in the war, and again last night, the Da Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the sale
Fan-taas-tic
(re: Auctioneer) Is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite to getting a job in the art world
There have naturally been questions of its authenticity, so to verify we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the Vatican
Doc
(rising, to Hawk) Some of us warthogs are more constipated than others
Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage and pulls out a large magnifying glass
look of distress passes over her face
Hawk closes his eyes in anticipation
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa-- (suddenly serene) Fantastic
Perfection
The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder
We'll begin the bidding at 82
5 million dollars
To you, sir
Eighty-three, Ninety--your bid, madame--Ninety point five
Hawk opens his eyes in confusion
He scans Anna coming off the stage, gliding toward the phone table
Hawk floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks up a phone and murmurs into it
lOO million clams, Francesco
The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, works the aisle, playfully mussing up the appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high- fiving the Rock Star, and sloppily frenching the Hooker
100 million dollars to Mr
Darwin Mayflower
Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure
Anna looks up from the phone to do the same
She swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk
Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce
She is outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash, her obnoxious little dog,
Francesco, 100 million and one
Darwin, to the crowd's delight, holds his struck heart
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere
Poor baby
Here, Bunny
Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100 million and one dollars
Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out of the nearby office, zipping up his fly
He immedi- ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage
The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with devoured canary smiles
Go-ing
Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to cause a scene
Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's eyeline to Hawk
Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of the gloating Big Stan
Go-ing
Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and veers back round up the aisle
The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity
Gone
The gavel comes down in super slow-motion
Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard
Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva
The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion
Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly
Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage
The Gavel hits
Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming, battered crowd
Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing position
He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit
He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna rising from the ground
hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna
Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying leap
He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing Path
They weary up off the ground and move down the aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse
No,  meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress polite push, perhaps
clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely
Excuse me, Milady
would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but  left my cape at the cleaners
Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs
("Hey,  was kidding") Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot
Why was the guard chasing you
(Serious answer
Na-a-h
) Because Danger, Doc, is my middle
Before Hawk can finish, a hanging horse out of nowhere hammers him into the ground and the viewer into darkness
: - -- Hawk stirs into consciousness strapped on an elevated gurney
Saint Pete, hey  know, the whole cat burglar thing, it sounds bad, but 'll take the worst cloud you got
Hawk's eyes focus
The Mario Brothers hover over him
News flash
You're not in heaven
Yet
30 seconds and counting, if you know what 'm saying
Couldn't just play along, could you
-- The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge
Antony raises up a mammoth gun
Pretty class way of covering your tracks
think that auctioneer landed at La Guardia
Subtlety was never one of our strong points
Neither's flossing
confused Antony touches his teeth with his gun hand
Hawk escapes from one of his straps and launces a nearby trayful of syringes into Antony's face where they ghoul- ishly quiver
Antony fires a wild shot, shattering the partition
The Scarfaced Bodyguard/Driver, now in paramedic white, freaks at the starred windshield
The ambulance bumper-pools off some innocent cars
Hawk frantically tries to undo his other strap but a howling Cesar, side-stepping his vibrating-on-the-floor brother, latches onto the back of the gurney and wrenches it backward
The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it
The gurney wheels hit the road, sparking
sheet from the gurney, caught on the door, yanks --Hawk is "water skiing" on his stomach atop the elevated gurney
Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the road
Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney and the sheet with a grit teeth stoneface
The sheet is torn from the gurney sending it rocketing off to the side on its own crazed volition
Hawk skis toward a      -
Life don't get much better than this
He then sees he's heading toward an   lane
Whizzing wildly forward on the gurney, Hawk scrambles into his pocket and wiggles out some change
He fran- tically winnows out some pennies and then maniacally the change from twenty feet away
The change ker-chunks into the basket and Hawk and the gurney   streak underneath the rising Gate-arm
through a gate-arm of another lane
Hawk and the still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off
Cesar pops his head through the partition
Make him into Roadkill
Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's
Yeah, run him down
Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream, then all three look out the windshield and scream
jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a fiery ball
In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down - Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking stop
Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness, carrying a steel suitcase
He kneels before Hawk and opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara- tus
He begins mumbling into a cellular phone
malevolent,    passes him and approaches Hawk
Both men are dressed in outfits that seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute couture
On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word On the other hand is the word
The Frog Hand hands a befuddled Hawk a card
It reads: Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops his neck, knocking him off the gurney
The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus
This is the worst night
When it rains, it pours
Name's Snickers
The plane leaves in 40
Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device
Hawk a- a-ghs into a kneeling position
Snickers returns to his suitcase and is passed by a     in the "outfit
" Almond Joy
know, pretty silly
But it's better than when we first started out, our code names were Diseases
You don't know what it's like being called Clymidia for a year
(walking off) Whoops, forgot
She deftly kicks Hawk across the face
Hawk angrily bounds back up until he sees the Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them
Suddenly, the Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney
Laying atop Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks
My name's Butterfinger
No shit
The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat that screams Old Time
His name will be Don't you just hate kids
George, you promised
No Old / New  jokes
call them the
Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea
They think the Cold War involves penguins and
Don't  know you
You just might
'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it
At the time,  was bald with a beard, no moustache, and  had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, won't be offended
Bastard, you're going to need another nose
Hawk explodes upward
Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a gun
But 'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge
used you as a diversion
while you were getting captured upstairs, was shredding documents in the basement
Deep down,  guess was just jealous
You were one incredible thief
To what do  owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle
As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk
Want to make things up to you
That's why  got you this gig, doll
Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun
" Three minutes, twenty-three seconds
If you think 'm doing another
Hush
My employer wants a meeting
Employer
The president
No, somebody powerful
Oh
Look
what's that up there
'm supposed to fall for that
Shucks
Guess not
Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face, knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase
Snickers slams it shut revealing a sticker
-- Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch
He has been put in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit
He eyes and touches his new duds with complete bafflement
He then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping, take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as " Solo Mio" blares on the soundtrack
No
Way
Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase
Welcome to Rome, sir
Yes way
-- Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower- logoed
The car moves off as Hawk slides in
- facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the cellular
While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand, then holding up one finger in a "be with you in a sec" facial move
For those kind of wages,  could have built the factory in America
They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts
hear depressing news like this and  want to commit genocide
(slamming phone) Alfred, hold my calls
So, Hawk
The Hawkster
What do you think of the vehicle
You could host American Bandstand in here
Why did you duck at the auction, asshole
Because  didn't want to get hurt, taterhead
comes to life as Darwin babbles
What can  tell you, 'm the villain
Initially it was a priority to keep a lot of buffers between you and me, but since most of them are dead now,  thought what the heck
Hawk, you come highly recommended
would have done some things differently at the auction house, but hey,  want to be in business with you
Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then shoves it into a violent paper shredder
Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door
simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings
My life is not some deal
(
) It's Boston, Mr
Mayflower
'm sorry,  have to take this
Those are valid points though
Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr
Hyde, while giving Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures
You better have a good excuse
You better have a better excuse
You are so weak
'm only thankful your ancestors didn't settle America or else my name would be Running Brave or Vomiting Antelope
Really
Well, listen close, babe
Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in his armrest
Darwin presses a button and a fills the car as it comes to a stop
Shall we
Darwin bolts out
Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod Serling to explain things, then bolts out too
-- Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering fascistly marble superstructure
Alfred brings up the rear
So Hawkasaurus,  won't mince words
Whatever
You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads
You think you're God
For all  know, you're probably right
just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after  find out what it is
Man, why didn't you just buy the horse
What am  saying, you did buy it
Oh
Let's see
There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci
Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica
If  seem vague, grand
We want a low profile on this, that's why got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved
helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up
So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means
Way to go, Alfie
How many people did you break that thing in front of
Good help's hard to find
guess that's a no
-- mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva, and Bunny hangs above a mammoth -shaped conference table
Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart- stopping dark outfit is Minerva
Metal riffs semi- audibly spew from a headset she wears
Surrounding the table is a ranging from a nine year old to a
They converse to the person at their side in businesslike tones, oblivious to Minerva
Ladies and gentlemen of the board
The board members go into tableau silence
Minerva con- tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds
And Min-er-va
Let's give it up for Hudson Hawk
The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside
Hello
Bunny, Ball-Ball
Minerva lobs a ball in the air
Bunny, the annoying dog, scurries beside Hawk to catch it
Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue
He sees take a luxurious sip of cappuccino
Minerva paces up upon the table
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem
That's two hundred dollars a day
So he can get a hooker and some tequila
Veto, Darwin
Guess  know who wears the penis in this family
(jumping off table) For God's sake, chain this convict
With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art handcuffs
Alfred, you're a very polite psychopath, but if you
Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the edge of the table, into an empty seat
The Board Members politely applaud
Alfred pulls Hawk's hands around his back and cuffs him
Bunny intensely sniffs his crotch
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but 'm a regular joe just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals
It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones
But now finally  got my new goal
World domination
With your help
Bunny
quit that
Bunny, ball-ball
Bad bunny
Think he's already got today's ball-balls
Five more minutes please, it's been so long
Minerva yanks away the yelping dog
Anybody have a cigarette
But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison don't care anymore
hope you have the receipts for the threads
You go back, you won't be alone
You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate
You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral
Depressing
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police
You have no proof
Ah, the magic word
Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing the auction house, on a bare wall
The Board members gush
The Elderly Woman gives a thumbs-up
It's veja du, Hawkhead
Something you wish never happened
We shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind the hidden cameras
Hired the guy who did the last Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue
Excellent work
whoops, damn Fotomat assholes
slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked out in leather
He clicks ahead
Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads-- /
Minerva leans over in front of him
Tomorrow, you're going to hit a church
: '-- The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in on the Mayflower limousine circling around it
Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine in stylish Italian sunglasses
'm robbing the Vatican
The nuns at St
Agnes predicted that 'd end up doing this
Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning stupidly
Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle finger
Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural
Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope performing a Coronation
(half-hearted) Excuse me, 'm being blackmailed into robbing the Vatican by a psychotic American corporation along with a
"You're being"
uh,  don't, uh
jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back
Forget it, man
Go tackle a jaywalker
/ Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway
He scans up to some rooftops and makes a note
until he sees a line of International Phone Boothettes
Checking for Flunkies, he rips one up
Operator,  want to make a collect call to Alex Messina, New York
The Flunkies drift into view
Hawk hangs up and seethes off
Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a room at the end bustling with excitement
Coming to the mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles
Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details, of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair- cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and the object of their gaze
--an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to the familiar   of a  inside a
The case is located between two informational tablets enclosed in glass columns
Enter Holy Da Vinci theme
(
) But it is his gift as an inventor who drew together science and art that is most incredible
Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio bag, striding down the stairs with a group of She brightens back, giving him a quick verbal breath and a hand squeeze
Tough guy
What are you--How's your head
(vegetable) Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too
She laughs, going into her public voice
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more
(under his breath) That's what you theenk
Question, sir
His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank
trailing the group, moves next to Hawk, bitching away to her  ,
This is so bor-ing
Do you hate Italy as much as  do, Pokey
(bad ventriloquism) Si, senor
Italy sucks the big one
why can't we go to the Epcot Center
The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle from her side
Hawk eyes the elephant strangely
These more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that
The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's head
The  goes off
The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage
Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents
Needless to say, everyone goes crazy
Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the alarm off
Two   drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the entranceway and  -  wrangle them on
The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has been beheaded by the cage/lamp
She is pulled away and spanked
Pokey, come back
Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in around him
The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap- lessly making their way up the opposite staircase
Come on, this stuff will knock you out
Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr
Bond
Never, why do you ask
Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door, Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a The wall closes as the Flunkies come flying out, baffled
Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark circular staircase
Whoa
Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins
My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke
The Nuns at St
Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what  am today
Not a compliment
Sure Hudson
Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo
Could you believe that crazy elephant
Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into
-- four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a mini-underground station
Workers latch onto mail bags
Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door
Whoa, part 2
Does it go to Times Square
Delivers up to ten at night
The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals
It's actually not that an unusual set-up
The secret passageway on the other hand
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained
Nice
But right out of our brochure
Oh, you read that
Actually  wrote it
It's a good sentence
It can apply to people
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself
don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls
(smoothing his jacket) And  buy my own clothes
My life's a little boring
God,  wish  could say the same thing
What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight
Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians
'll bring my entire repertoire
The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking around
Anna and Hawk crouch down
And 'll bring my entourage
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to
There's a place two blocks east of here
Enzo's
Say 10:30
Said
Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile
He crawls out an exit door
As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears
She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding bang on the head
She then darts to a large crucifix and looks up
Father, it's obvious
He's up to something
Suddenly a speaker in Jesus's mouth gently crackles
(Italian) Report downstairs at once
Yes, sir
paces in an enigmatic Vatican area
Anna clacks up to him
Did he mention the Mayflowers
No, your Eminence
think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week
Attempt, you mean
The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk
The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists
We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey
Must you flirt with him so realistically
That's the best kind
wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either
" (chuckling) Let me be the one to quote Scripture
As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations
Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man
(unconvinced) Yeah
The big
-- The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate painters and swings into
Hawk grabs up the phone and dials
Hello, operator
'd like to make a collect call to New York number
The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza, behind an oblivious Hawk
Thank you, operator, thank you
Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear
Seeing the limo, he  and balls himself into a corner
Come on, Alex, pick up, you Reindeer goat cheese-eating motherfucker
' -- It is late night in New York
phone rings atop the bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight
-- Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding Bunny) emerge from the limousine
As he turns his con- centration back to the phone,   flows out from a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the limo
-lex, -lex, come on Alex
Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine pull off
Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as a mailman
Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot, into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him
Hawk then grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the booth
Hawk rotates off for an escape
but the rest of the crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns; Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble
Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip
Hawk gives him a double take
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk
Enjoying Italy
always had a soft spot for Rome
Did my first barehanded strangulation here
Communist politician
Why George, you big softie
God,  miss communism
The Red Threat
People were scared, the Agency was respected, and  got laid every night
humiliated Butterfinger comes waddling out, holding the phone
Kaplan rolls his eyes
Sorry, coach
(shaking his head) If his father wasn't the head of Shit,  hate this, the government's got me farmed out, working for the Mayflower corporation now, money beats politics
War isn't Hell anymore, it's Dull
Don't slaughter their men and rape their women, just steal their microchips
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, 'd feel sorry for you
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table
You're hitting the Vatican to-night
Tonight
You're whacked
The timing's off, 'm underequipped Damnit,  have a date
Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps
Gee Stud, this is going to be some date
No Harvey's Bristol Cream
Snickers, make the list happen
Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers
've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty
Thanks for sharing
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast
You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit
If you do anything to my friend
Yeah, right
By the way, as long as 'm getting things off my chest, 'm the one who killed your little monkey
Made it look like a Mafia hit
Did it for fun
Ciao
Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different directions as Hawk howls in frustration
Kit Kat moves behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him
What did you have against Little Eddie, motherfucker
He was just a monkey who liked to laugh
Come back without your yuppie army
'll triscuit you, you space shuttle eating
Shit
Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the face
Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him a card that reads:
Hawk looks up from the card
Kit Kat is gone, but Butterfinger scampers in his place
Hey, Mr
Hawk,  got those 72 stamps
Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps
One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an indoor track
The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it
The train zips into a tunnel
The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting table
bell rings as a clock hits 10
The workers do a sigh of relief
Shucking off their uniforms, they head out
hand rips out of the huge package
-- Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to the mouth of the doorless Codex room
He pauses to hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at the sides
Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops
"Beware the Odd Steps
" Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized alarm button
Why Kit Kat, aren't you a gentleman
Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to where the Codex is bathed in a holy light
He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running across the top
The parallel mirrors now face out from each other
Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he thrusts the mirrors into the beams
The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk exhales
He balances the connected mirrors then crawls through his tent-like passageway
Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex
The acid sizzles
-- thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling on
Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass cracks of the rectangular case loosen
Hawk pulls out a pocket fisherman
The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down the hall
Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room
He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now empty mirror-frame then
Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor deflecting mirrors
He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to be standing
Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping acid
He also notices a fishing hook attached to the binding of the Codex
The fishing wire leads out of the glass case
The Guard reaches to touch it when suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk
The Codex  off its perch, setting off the  and sending the bizarre cage/lamp   and the hapless Burly Guard
The green gas commences its noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's hands
He then hurls a softball, smashing a window on the other side of the room
The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel down into the mouth of the codex room
Only one Gas Mask drops from the doorway
The Vatican Guard pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of shoulders to the fainting Guard three
Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting Fixture
Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to another
He then ungrapples and heads toward the shattered window
The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving chase
Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt
Suddenly a brick on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk
His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof, landing against the antennae
' showing Mr
Ed
speaking to Wilbur in Italian goes fuzzy
, wearing his famous hat and a Notre Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it
Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag
The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a warning shot
Hawk stretches to the bag
His fingers touch as the Guard continues to bound forward
Please God, Please God
let the guard shoot me
Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican Guard hovering over him on the roof
The worm's on the other foot, yankee noodle candy
Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the grapple
Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof
Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple across a road around a tree branch
Hawk ties the end of grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath and
The viewer follows him on his breathtaking ride
The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof
He gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down
is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits the friction belt
Hawk drops with a wild scream
and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost
His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without children
He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails down upon
and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it
Hawk tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes flying off
-- Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table to the female hands holding open a menu
The menu comes down
It is Anna
Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag
Oh Hudson,  was worried you weren't going to drop by
never break a date
Scout's honor
Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand then quickly rips it off as a  comes to the table
Fettucini con Funghi Porcini
Bellissimo, signor
Oh, and could  have some ketchup with that
Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment
Other sadly shake their heads
-- At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp, Snickers is being an Uglier American to an , while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads butter over an entire baguette
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries
This is France, you gotta have French
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference
The Waiter sneaks off
Butterfinger devours his bread
Italy, France, Moscow
They all just wanna be Nebraska
Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do
Man, Democracy isn't free elections
We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos
" Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation
Jesus, gotta get out of this job
If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit
Ah to be in Pari-is and in love
They look off to
' Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine basket with a bottle of ketchup in it
Hawk nabs it
This is bueno
They had the worst ketchup in prison
uh
Prison
was the Warden
How long were you in
Let's just say,  never saw
Wow, you were "in the joint
" "Doing hard time
"  It's funny, but that excites me
seem to have a thing for sinners
seem to have a thing for sinning
sinning
Check please
Ah, anything for dessert
(she shoots) Yes
Something to go
(she scores) 'll bring the ketchup
' -- The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his bruises
What have you been doing
Uh
old badminton injury
Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise
She stops herself and opts for tickling
tickles, ticKleS,
(not stopping) Oh, 'm so sorry
Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor
Hawk slithers around to devour her toes
Anna closes her eyes and arches her back
She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her
With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk and stands up, trying to brush off her sins
'm sorry
can't
(softly approaching) Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade
don't make love every ten years,  get a little cranky
It's also been a long time for me
-- Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until Catholic girls are scary
Somebody robbed the Vatican
Oh
No
Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat
She bumps into the canvas bag
The Codex slides out
They both catch it in mid-air
Anna's eyes pop
She wrenches the Codex away and kicks
Hawk pulls her into a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug
The Codex falls to the floor unharmed
It's not what you think
Okay, maybe it is
You really went and did it
With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it
Nobody does it better, Hudson
You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex
Wha-- What are your plans for the weekend
Hoisting away the Colosseum
Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower
' -- Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of Hawk and Anna up in the window
Snickers snaps a cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a goo-ey pastry
What's going on in there
Do you want me to rape them
(throwing pastry down) Dunkin does it better
Just read, Butterfinger
Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy
"Da Vinci had fears about his more dangerous designs, so he created a shorthand code in reverse script
" To yourself
What are they doing
In twenty seconds, we go in
' Foam shoots out over the coffee
Hawk smiles down at it as Anna works a cappuccino machine
For two years, 've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces
Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it
Does everyone in the world know more than me
Jesus, 'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff
Lifted a piece of licorice when  was one and a half
Who knew it would lead
They even got the involved
The
what
God, no
(raising his cup) Ooh,  guess  do know something Here's looking at you, kid
The agents burst from the car, guns raised
Now
' Hawk sips the cappuccino
His face immediately contracts
This doesn't taste like cappuccino
Oh,  must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it
Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her hand
Hawk collapses
His coffee cup lands perfectly in Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly on the pillow
The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised
Why didn't you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the Vatican tonight
My people will not be happy
want to see Kaplan
That's not overly possible
He
But guys, remember, he's in the castle at Vinci
Snickers and Almond Joy grimace into fake smiles
-- helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the opening Da Vinci sequence
Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap
She is pondering
-- sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing Kaplan
Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair
Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna
She reacts as she comes into the light
Kaplan takes the Codex from her
Way to go, Anna
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal
(gung-ho lying) And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs
Is that it
Hawk stirs
The viewer gets his woozy
Actually George, it's not it
What are we doing in this castle
happen to know the Mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do
The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the opening
(trying to be solemn) It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over
Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead
(taking it in) Oh Lord
the only reason  ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr
Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you
Basically that you're part of the same car pool
Anna
Anna
Anna
If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex
Now, get some sleep
Kit Kat
Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna
Cat got his tongue
Actually he never told us what it was
Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue
How sweet
trust you will see Hudson Hawk is given to the proper authorities
recommend leniency
(holding in a laugh) Oh,  think we all do
Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking Kit Kat
Do you think she has any idea that Operation Deflower Mayflower is as bogus as Kit Kat's tits
don't think so, although bringing her to the castle gave her a big, juicy hint
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't  cut out her heart
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization
Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office
-- Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak on some bushes
She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit Kat who fakes one back
-- Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene
In the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine
Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine
In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos
Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand
Seven
Minerva turns the gadget up to  and presses a button
Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster
Darwin batters it
The ball ricochets into the forehead of an "amused" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat pants
Jolly
Good
Shot
Sir
Ooh, it's Hudson Hawk, you cease to amaze me, convict
You are a terrible cat burglar
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven
You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out
Like a "cat", one could say
Shucks, 'll just take it back
Hawk reaches for the Codex
Kaplan pulls it over to Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient binding
Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit it open
(bouncing up) No, let me
(pout) don't care
Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange machine parts behind them
Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri- cally perverted crystal
Another piece of the puzzle for the Da Vinci Alchemy project
Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each other, all start to speak, then all stop
This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin Flunkies
Oh, you
There's nothing more hate than failure
All you had to do was follow the Hawk, it's not like  said "Teach our nation's children how to read
" Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets
guess we're just going to have to kill 'em
Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground
God Minerva,  was kidding quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet
He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead
reverberate off each other with laughter
Bloodstained, Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge
Minerva's smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets
Get away from there, convict
Just browsing
Don't touch me
Snickers touches him
Hawk smashes him in the jaw
Snickers rears back to reciprocate
Don't hurt him
We need him for the final job
Snickers stops himself, snarling in frustration
Hawk is suddenly the happiest man he's been in Italy
Oh weeeeelly, don't hurt me
Even if  do this
Hawk pulls Snickers' glasses off and stamps them
And this
Hawk knees Butterfinger in the stomach
Surely this must offend
Hawk body-block-dominoes Butterfinger and Snickers to the ground
Kaplan and Almond Joy aim their guns
That's it
Playfully lifting his shirt, Hawk grabs Minerva and manually swivels her hips to the beat of his
Things are getting a little loose at the Da Vinci workshop tonight
"Put your left leg in, take your right foot out
"  May  call you Minnie
Hawk mambos to Alfred who rifles his blade up to Hawk's crotch
Hawk stops dancing
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job
Hey, guys, 've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on
Alfred moves the blade a little upward
Hawk a-a-ghs
Big girls don't cry--eye
Two minutes, 35 seconds
Damnit, 'm involved in this thing, so just wanna know what this thing is
wanna be treated as an adult
That's fair
Tomorrow
Back in Rome
Now go to your room
Alfred strategically Vulcans Hawk on the neck
He falls
-- The lips of Anna come into light
Forgive me Father for  have sinned
It's been 1200 hours since my last confession
' The cardinal suppresses a yawn
Hit me with your best shot
(
) betrayed a man
good man
An innocent man
thief
Anna, what are you trying to say
' He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure
But he knew Right and Wrong
Oh, and we kind of messed around
freaks and goes into some Italian gibberish before
"Messed around" messed around know--  don't want to know
First base
Second Base
Stop me when 'm getting warm
(
) little petting is not the issue
Sorry
Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside
-- The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional curtains
So let me get this straight, sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk is not willingly working for the Mayflowers but Kaplan and the Candy Bars are Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a for she is a Nun
The gaspingly beautiful church unfolds as they walk
You got it
Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and 'm the punchline
thought we were using the  to help us to get Mayflower, but really the  was using me to keep us away from Mayflower
Oh, why couldn't  be the Cardinal in charge of catering
If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything
What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty
'm going to find out
'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world
know,  know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me
" God go with you, sister
Anna puts on the coolest pair of sunglasses, deliciously contrasting with her habit
She moves off
-- Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board- member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny
Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou
In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference
("What's my Line") That's two down to Kitty Carlisle
Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his fingernails
He rips off the blindfold in subdued frustration
As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously molests Alfred
Cool, isn't it
Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical
On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart
Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless
Alchemy
(casually goosing Alfred) Alchemy
Is the business term of the 90's, my man
Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago
dumped some lira into research
Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history
Money isn't everything, gold is
Fuck blue chip stocks
Fuck -bills
Fuck Junk Bonds
got the real deal
Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold
Market crashes
Bomb drops
Greenhouse effect affects
We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world
In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower
It's one party we'd love to poop
Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin
Sure
The Kremlin
Makes sense
The Kremlin
Why not
Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man
Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex
Jail, you asshole
Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out
Bunny, Ball-Ball
Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a tennis ball into its mouth
'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career
'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom
You want an address on that last one
Bunny barks up at Hawk in anger
Bunny, not you too
You've got a dilemma, tiger think  know what's going to help you solve it
Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs and the blindfold
The viewer's viewpoint stays on a writhing Hawk
'll kill all you
Even the old lady
Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs, then picks the lock with his teeth
Hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous Italian leather coat
hated cigarettes until  saw my first No Smoking sign
Keep off the Grass
Let's play Soccer
Only law  cared about was friendship
Broke that one too, didn't
This Gates-Mario Brothers--Mayflower-Da Vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal
Visit foreign lands, take their treasures
don't know,  thought you'd get into it
It's better than playing darts with
's at the bar
didn't know it was going to be like this
Them using me to use you
'm sorry, there's only one way out of this and it's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you
Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in
-- The piazza from the fascist
building are bustling with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling
Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps
The other agents stroll in the periphery
just don't think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone
Don't worry George, this is the reason we put the old diabetic guinea on the payroll to begin with
To keep Hawk in line
They'll talk about "being buddies" and "chugging brewskis
" (raising glass) You gotta love male bonding
As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building
You were saying
Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling
The wigging out passers- by give them space
You bastard
You fucked my freedom for a lousy job
Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure
He shakily raises his gun
Hawk
'm so sorry
Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex
They roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin, Minerva, and the  who react with "This can't be happening" catatonia
Two  go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of the staircase
Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes
No
Alex
Wake up, you can't go out like this
Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him
Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up
Snickers stops
Four policemen blast from the back of the van
One holds back the crowd
One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van
The other two drag in Alex
The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance as the van pulls away
Plan , anyone
Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off after them
The van can be seen swerving off
where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked --  break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn way
The   off as the Vespa spins around the corner
Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van
He hits his handle with frustration
Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses, Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy
The Vatican Truck pulls up behind her
giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not- so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back
Alex excitedly gives himself an insulin shot
Oh thank God, you're dead
It was so beautiful
When the blanks went off, they
Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw
You bastard
You fucked my freedom for a lousy job
But  said  was sorry
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of my life
What was your per-diem
Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins
know, made call, when Anna tracked me down
Hudson, don't you understand
And you, Dr
Cappucino, you're lucky don't hit women, assuming you are a woman
'm not taking anything for granted anymore
-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization
The--made-a-fool-of-me
-care-for-you
Oh
Well, what's this
Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower Museum from out of his pocket
Anna turns white
Where did you get this
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex
the Mayflower Museum
It's from the machine
All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already
We can't let that happen
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray
Something like that
(pulling out plane tix) Well, forget about it
Hawk and are going to Rio
We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich
Right, buddy
Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just
You better believe  can
'm sick of people telling me what have to do
It's that kind of selfish attitude that
Selfish attitude
'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson
Right now, you're the only guy
Without your help,
Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression
The weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and swirling toward peaceful clarity
The world is beautiful
Every day in prison  made sure to remember that
It's only when  actually got out that  forgot
If  was sane, 'd be on that plane to Rio
But being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporation's perverted vision does something to your mental health
The world is beautiful and 'm tired of being fucked
(turning around) It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to bite the pillow
Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross
Alex goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion
That was beautiful
laughed,  cried
Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from Alex
Rio, Alex
After all they've done to
Hey, these tickets are for Moscow
(knowing smile) Damn travel agency
That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it
proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's bullet holes
Anna sweetly intervenes
Ketchup
Stupido Americani
The locals give off a slightly dazed "-a-h" and move off
-- Wind blows through the shattered conference room window
Snickers is banging on his computer apparatus at the table with the Mayflowers and the other agents
We're all family now
My team has done a lot of rougher things than steal the model of a helicopter
We're going to whack this place so fast we'll have time to shop for American imports
Darwin and Minerva politely smile and then turn away to each other with knowing looks
The computer screen shows the familiar image of the Kremlin building that turns into a complex look at interiors the viewer will later see
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff
It'll have the least number of guards
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor
--- head-rubbing Hawk and a stomach rubbing Alex kneel on the floor of a moving van, over a barely legible drawing of what was so neatly delineated on the  computer
Both guys are dressed as priests and are chewing gum
We're going in from the ground floor
Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm
Hawk laughs and pops up into the passenger seat
Anna is revealed to be driving in her habit
Hawk gives her a kiss
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously
Uh, yeah
Guess 'm a wee bit nervous
'm sorry  could only score clergy passports
Fits my new image
thief for the masses
This is one job 'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying
Gum
Hawk, Alex, and Anna all spit out their gum into a bag Hawk holds
The security's actually not that severe
It doesn't have to be
Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails
Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of Budapest
Shwoof, that makes me feel better
can't believe this is the Iron Curtain
All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot
" You sound disappointed
Yeah,  mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard
passes a textbook shot of the Kremlin in the distance
(
) It's supposed to be parachuting in the moonlight
-- Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their parachutes
Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at the top of the building and a flashing green one inside
We are the blue light
The green light is where the Art Treasures room is
Let's go make a purple light
Where's Kit Kat
Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk, Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds
They scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance
Delivery Entrance
Low Security
Gum
All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag
Count of three
Why not just go now
Okay
The Trio rush for the door
comes out on the roof to light a cig- arette
He looks in the distance to the motivating team
Suddenly a card floats down into his hand
It reads:
'
The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him
The Guard swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a crossbow shot to his Adam's apple
Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter bashes it
open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm
Alex all-fours beneath the alarm
Hawk does a Michael Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks -, pulled from his bag, between the hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound
They rush ahead
The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on Snickers' apparatus rings
Kaplan answers it
Everything's going fine, Minerva, thanks for asking
Minerva chats on a cellular moving down a hallway, with Darwin, who is holding in his laughter as if this was a great crank
say who needs this Hudson Hawk anyway
The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic and gorgeous ballroom
Two lush staircases lead up from the floor
From behind a pillar, the gang checks out the activity below
tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at the opposite end of the ballroom by
Threaten- ing   maneuver on the floor
(Wizard of Oz) Oh-Eee-Oh--Whoa-Oh
They then make a mad scuffle across their side of the second level, hunkering down by the level railing
As they move into another wing hallway, the viewer's viewpoint moves back down to the ballroom floor to see a gloating    , the latter still on the phone
Everybody here, in Rome, wishes you tinsel boxes of love
The servants move away from the tablecloth and the table, revealing that it is shaped like an 's come out to join the Mayflowers at the table
Kaplan hangs up the phone
Lazy, rich, condescending bitch
The team moves up to the rooftop doorway where Kit Kat is
He holds up an "About Time" card
The agents laugh and greet them
, Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a pitch darkness
, - looms above the doors
They give it a a quick glance before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers
Eighth room down, babe
Guards come exactly every three minutes
Three
Oh
Oh
"Side by Side
" Our trio charges down the hallway
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money
"Maybe we're ragged and funny
" They reach a      , They go to work on it
Not losing the beat
"But we'll travel along, singing a song
Side by Side
" With a gust of wind, Kaplan and the Candy Bars bluster through the rooftop door into another hallway, where are taking it easy
Create a diversion
Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini-Uzis
rushes out a door before the agents, zipping up his fly
Almond Joy twists his neck with an agonizing
Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural through the windowed double doors
Behind the doors, they poke up to see a emerge from the darkness to check out the door
Now that's a lock
Don't worry, we'll get it
Can  sing this time, too
Please
Hawk and Alex are not thrilled about the idea, but Anna's eye flutter does it
Uh,  guess so
The Bespectacled Guard moves back into the darkness
The Soviet
's open up presents of pink tennis shoes, silly -shirts, and Nintendo joysticks as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them
look at you Soviet people and feel
pity
superiority
Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children
(smiling) We're here to say, your government was right
So let's get busy
Have some fun and make some deals
Alex holds a lit match into the lock, while Hawk does something incomprehensible with a screwdriver
They are improvising
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt" "How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt" Anna suddenly, booms out the chorus in a way that Hawk and Alex can barely concentrate
"But we'll travel the road, Sharing the load
Side by Side
" The  team saunters through corpses up to a door similar in lock and design to the one Hawk and Alex are working on
Snickers's computer screen shows the blue light directly above the green light
This is the room above the Art Treasures room
The lock is a Natalya -, first created
Snickers, baby,  love you like a brother, but really, who cares
Silencer bomb
Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle
He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel
He fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking
come Hawk, Alex, and Anna, panting
That was close
Anna,  think you better stay
You can be lookout
Take Alex's gun
Alex hands Anna his gun, who glumly takes it like a Little Sister not allowed to play
Hawk and Alex go back through the doors
The  bomb blows up the door with a weird silencer sound
Kaplan and the Candy Bars giddily whoop as they rush through the smoking door
-- Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension
"You can be the lookout
" Anna suddenly moves past the pillar to see the Mayflowers and the
She gasps and hurls herself behind the second level railing
, in a   baseball cap, addresses Darwin
Before we serve you "the main course," hee, hee, we need to know specifics about what you can do for us
We-- Bluntness
How amusingly Hungarian
Listen up, for reasons  don't want to get into,  recently had to close down a petroleum factory, but 'm going to re-build it here and Madonna's going to cut the ribbon
Frozen burritos in Leningrad
1982 fantasy
1992 reality
Hawk and Alex more frantically toil on the lock
"We all had our quarrels and parted
" "But we'll be the same as we started
The lock clunks open
They race through the doors into
Hawk and Alex weave through the room which is crammed, with little nuance, to the gills with great art treasures including an impressive array of Faberge eggs
solid gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall
"Just traveling along, singing a song
Side--" Geez, this place is a mess
Voila
They rumble toward an opening in the wall of the room covered by a small curtain that has the Da Vinci Man in the Circle drawing emblazoned across it
Hawk reaches for the curtain
Alex puts his arm around him and speaks, not sings
Side by side, man
Suddenly, the roof above them explodes
Kaplan and the Candy Bars drop down behind them
What the hell
You're supposed to be dead
'm a ghost
Boo
don't want to sound immature, but we were here first
wish  could think of those cute quips the way you can, Hawk, but can't, so 'll just shoot Alex
Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest
Alex crumples backward, moaning
Butterfinger, casually, but with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his back
No
That was pretty uncool, George
Sorry, you know he kind of reminds me of Little Eddie
But  digress
Ah, victory is so sweet
Kaplan pulls back the Da Vinci curtain
Nothing is there
lifts up a silver domed serving tray, revealing the Da Vinci helicopter model
Yum
This is the best meal ever had
bulges her eyes at the revelation
She pulls out Alex's gun and bangs herself in the head
What to do
Kaplan is bugging out
Damnit, this isn't the plan
Blue light, green light, shit
Snickers, Kit Kat,
, scramble, see if you can find out anything
They thunder out
Hawk, still in Butterfinger's oblivious clutches, shouts
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you
They may be scum, but if  get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach
don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie
Kaplan raises his gun
Darwin holds the Da Vinci model in one hand and raises a glass of vodka in the other
You're helping us achieve a goal and in return, 'm giving you a key to the world's executive washroom
Don't piss it away
Skoal, amigos
(
) Stop or 'll shoot
Minerva and some various Soviet  spew their vodka to look up to Anna pointing a gun down at them from the second level
She is shivering, shaking the gun
You people are immoral and narcissitic and  won't let you
In unison, the Soviet Soldiers surrounding the table begin machine gunning up at her
She dives behind the railing
Kaplan lowers his gun
can't believe this
'm in fucking Russia, or do  have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and 'm shooting a non-Bolshevick
(raising back up his gun) never thought 'd say "'m just in this job for the money
"  Sad
Any last immature quips
No
(a beat) But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt
Falling for the oldest trick in the book, Butterfinger looks down to his shirt
What blood stains
Hawk bounces up to savagely head-butt Butterfinger
Butterfinger slams back against a wall causing the Gold Sickle to fall down around his neck and knock him to the ground, pinning his head to the floor
The Gold Hammer next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's skull
You want immature, how 'bout an egg fight
Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's hand
Hawk pelts a batch more at him
Kaplan sloppily whips some eggs back
Hawk finally smashes one in half and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye
He squeals to the ground, geysering blood
Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex
Alex, are you
can't believe you didn't notice
My weight
lost ten pounds in Rome You're a reed, man
gotta get Anna
Hang in there
Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload
Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall- way area into the ballroom area
They stop at the sight of Anna
Anna-bannana-fo-fanna,  guess have to cut out your heart for real now
It's not personal
Anna feebly raises her gun
Almond Joy laughs and pulls out a knife
You won't shoot
read your dossier
Sister
The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna
The Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure
Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone ballet
gotta get a new job
Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of Anna as their partner wilts to the ground
The men, Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross- bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers with some graphic success
Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to her level
She bolts off
The last of the Soviet  flee as the Soldiers tip over the  shaped table on its side, using it for cover, firing upward

He fires down an arrow for a successful kill
Another guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the back of the table with a quality shot
Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally creeps behind him
comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where Anna is bustling
They hug
The Mayflowers got
Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in their direction
Noticing them back, the model-toting Mayflowers halt
turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow
Alfred effort- lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues to move forward
Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload
breaks the standstill
What a pleasant surprise
You're probably wondering
But you're going to tell us anyway
hate a man with a sense of humor
While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal
If you think you're getting past me
Grunting behind them, Snickers gun-butts Hawk to the ground
Don't be stupid
they
Bastard
If you were a true American
Just shut up and hit me
Snickers swings a punch
Hawk blocks it then whomps him in the chest
As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her into a pillar, and watches her crumple

Alfred stabs him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground

Alfred discards him over the edge
Kit Kat sails down upon the
The lone card of "" plops from his open eyed corpse
and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a staircase
and Minerva watch the fight with amusement
Alfred approaches
Alfred, the getaway car
slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade
Damnit,  hate this
'm a cat burglar
Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit
Too bad
Snickers goes for a final thrust when suddenly one of the silencer time bombs suctions to his head
Hawk turns to see Alex, barely standing, at the top of the stairs, holding the strange rifle
Darwin and Minerva turn to this dramatic entrance
They start to trot off

told you it was a fake

Snickers somersaults up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb
Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their guns and are poking their heads out of the  to watch

Oh God,  always wanted to know how to play the harp, there just was so little time

Snickers plugs his ears

Hawk bounds up to Alex, who puffs down onto the steps
Get 'em
They went down the hallway
Let's just forget it,  mean
Get em
Hawk rushes up the
stairs, gives a "What can  do
" glance to the unconscious Anna, and then continues rushing, past a pillar
Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and moves forward
Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall- way
He sees Darwin breezing in front of him
Darwin looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness
Minera sits down next to the pained Alex
Alex
How's it going
Go, go to Hell, to Hell
Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open
Where's your insulin
No
Well, Bon Appetite
Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the candy bar in his mouth
Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him
Hawk kicks him off
Oh, come on
Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering
Very good, Alex, but you re still alive
She pulls out another candy bar
Alex, with a last burst of strength, punches her across the face
That's fair
Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats
Why does this have to be so hard
Tell me about it
Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the darkness
Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see  - screeching out of the darkness with Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun
Bullets fly around them
From his back pocket, Hawk slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into Kaplan's hands
Take this to Hell with you
Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp
Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture to the charging limousine
My pension
The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield
Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash into the windshield
Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp
Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun
Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin, locking his legs around his neck and crushing him down into
Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo
The Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat
Darwin's gun goes off
right through Alfred's throat
He slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator
blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and bashing off paintings and mirrors
Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side of Hawk's hand into its teeth
mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall
Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg- lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest
Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream
Darwin's entire body bucks wildly
Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun
Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof
God-damnit,  only wanted to destroy the world in my own image
'm a regular Joe
Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind
The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin
Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it
Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin
God, let's talk abut this
The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's body connects with the mural
Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle
Alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel
Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the Da Vinci model
He looks to Alfred, Kaplan crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs
Wow, this is really gonna hurt the resale value
Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up
She has a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead
Oh, honey
Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way he left him
Hawk rushes to him
We did it man, we
Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder
Alex falls back
Written over his face in red lipstick is
Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind Anna, putting on red lipstick
Minerva slams her back to the ground
Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred, bleeding from the neck
Hawk tries to throw a punch, but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face
The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene
-- damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters
" Solo Mio" returns on the sound- track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci
Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly
They melt into a kiss
Oh Hudson
told you not to call me Hudson
The only people who called me that were the nuns at
Oh Hudson, 'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent
(cut-off laugh) This is too bad to be false
Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a bandage around his neck
His voice is strange, but still polite
Welcome back to Vinci
Last rites, sister
Please, no nun jokes
They're a bad habit to get into
get it
Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause
She killed Alex
Alfred gives them a push
Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball machine
-- Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created piece by piece
In the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of   wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals
(
) ---
Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral-wear
Sorry,  couldn't resist
You're probably wondering why you're still alive
Anna
As Minerva speaks,   forcibly escorts Anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it
want you to monitor the Da Vinci's directions from the apprentice diary
And Hawk, didn't want you to go to hell without knowing that Darwin and 's dream came true
(suddenly sheepish) Beside that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together
Alfie and  were up all night with the thing
commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the gold machine
Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground
You killed a friend
Why should help you go for the gold
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but 'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning
Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns
Markets will crash- crash
Financial Empires will crumble-crumble
Except yours-yours
The goal of world domination
Well, if you put it that way, Minnie
How can resist
You can't, convict
You're just a shmoe
Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them
It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me
"  It's a natural inclination
But for , this isn't a fantasy, it is reality You are on my planet
You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist
The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to
Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her
She pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings
Reading off the reflection, her eyes widen
Do it
There's no reason to fight anymore
She's a force of nature
Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror
If you pull this off,  can't promise  won't kill you
mean, who we trying to kid
But  will spare the Flying Nun here
And to think  thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps
killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover
So don't play with me
Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed to
Anna vibrates, being electrocuted
Okay, fine
Minerva switches it off
Giving himself a head rub, Hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects
He and  and with a loud , puts them together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene
Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set
Oh Hawk, don't ever change
Go, team, go
Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da Vinci had it in his machine
Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the machine
Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart- ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the chemical's zodiac sign
Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place
Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff
hope you know what
Trust Leonardo
Wha
Anna puts her fingers on his lips
Minerva throws a lever
Steam begins to percolate from the furnace towards the machine
(into the headset) We're for real
begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster
The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment
The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an element
The arms click higher
The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video monitor, taking notes
The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes
murmurs to Hawk
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that  decoded
The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down
Isn't it wonderful
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal
Wha -- you don't want to know
Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket
wanna know
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast
Da Vinci would be proud of you
The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the Lead Bar spinning its trough
There's a  and a controlled but jarring explosion
doubletakes
Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration Technicians to the ground
Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a religious purr
triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room
Hawk and Anna squint, blinded
Flinging off her goggles, literally beaming Minerva giggles forward
Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar
sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten
She moves closer, shouting into her head-set
Eureka, motherfuckers
The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace
Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set
'  (head-set) Minnie, hate to interrupt your orgasm, but
stand above the unconscious Technicians
Hawk is on head-set
Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna say you got the Midas touch, baby
Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion
The center of the machine blows
The pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer
Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls
Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face
It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti
turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war paint on his face and the words   painted on his chest,
How
You're unemployed, Alfie
Boss is dead
Her plan is over
(strange voiced) My plan is just beginning
'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but 'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses
Ooh-kay
Alfred rushes forward with a howl
Hawk meets him halfway
They trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats
Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness
She aims steadily, and fires
right into Hawk's arm
This allows Alfred to knock him back with a strong punch
Sorry
She fires again
The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle
Stop helping me
Thou shalt not kill
Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick Hawk back against a wall
Alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off-angle
Hawk yanks the shaft
Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's throat
Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft
With an all or nothing jerk, Hawk flicks the lever
The shaft clicks on the hinge
Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which is caught in the -shaped trap
The momentum of the sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the "" hits it-- Don't lose your head over this
Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth swing right onto the
The blades slam together and '  ,    , '
Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's head)
Excuse my crass American humor
The machine thunders with another explosion
Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop
She guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm
He delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he sees
standing in the open mouth of the workshop
Anna turns to Hawk
Allow me
Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground
Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun
Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing Anna, blood gently starts to emerge
Hawk can't get off a shot
He throws down the gun in exasperation
It lands next to The Gadget that is connected to the Tennis Ball Machine
Hawk rushes forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and then smiles sweetly toward the dog
Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball
Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth
Hawk slams down on the gadget
tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine
Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him    out a window
Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely
huge chunk of the roof  before the workshop door
Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles
Anna shakes her head vigorously
He pulls her out of the frame
man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat
It is He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule
He begins a stoic juggle when another loud  sends him to the ground
-- An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows
Debris frisbees toward the camera along with
Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from the bar on  '
The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle - through the glorious vista
The glider floats to a perfect landing before the Unforgettable Juggler
Che pazzo
Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke billowing castle
They smile and gush in relief
They wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and laugh again
The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush of dawn
Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride atop it
moves to a cafe table with a luminous smile
She unfolds a table cloth atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos
Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into the table
Have  ever told you the world is beautiful
(semi-seductively) 'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something
Hudson, 'm afraid 'm sticking with God
(smiling) But you're a close second, tough guy
What is that smile
(broadly grinning) got my planet back
Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup
The first one's for Alex
Cheers
The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee
