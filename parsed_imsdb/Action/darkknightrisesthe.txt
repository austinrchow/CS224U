Goyer (
) Harvey Dent was needed
He was everything Gotham has been crying out for
He was
a hero
Not the hero we deserved - the hero we needed
Nothing less than a knight, shining
The sound of cracking
Splintering
shape appears, in ice
The shape of a
The ice disintegrates
- Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent
But  knew Harvey Dent
was
his friend
And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did
Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his eulogy
believed in Harvey Dent
And we
: Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are - - Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia
third Militia drives
Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man
,   - An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery fire
bland  Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men, stands in front of a commuter plane
Man watches the Land Cruiser pull up, hard
The Militia Men jump out of the vehicle
The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the Man
2
Dr
Pavel, 'm
Dr
Pavel nods, nervous
Man hands the Driver a briefcase
He wasn't alone
Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men
He turns to Dr
Pavel
You don't get to bring friends
() They are not my friends
Don't worry, no charge for them
Why would  want them
They were trying to grab your prize
(Smiles
) They work for the mercenary
The masked man
() Bane
The Driver nods
Man turns to his Special Forces Men
Get 'em on board - 'll call it in
- The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains
,   - The three Hooded Men kneel by the cargo door, handcuffed
Man grabs Hooded Man 1
What are you doing in the middle of my operation
3
Hooded Man 1 says nothing
Man pulls out a handgun
The flight plan  just filed with the Agency lists me, my men, and Dr
Pavel here
But only one of you
Man opens the cargo door
Special Forces hang Hooded Man 1 out into the howling wind -  Man shouts above the wind
(Cocks weapon
) Nothing
Man fires out the open door and the Special Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet
' The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door
The prisoner says nothing
Man presses the gun to the man's hood - he cocks the gun
nothing
(
) Or he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of an aeroplane
Man turns to the Third Prisoner
Shuts the cargo door
Wiseguy, huh
At least you can talk
Who are you
We are nothing
We are the dirt beneath your feet
And no one cared who  was until  put on the mask
Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus
The eyes behind it are cold
Still
This is Bane
4
Who we are does not matter
What matters is our plan
() If  pull this off, will you die
It would be extremely painful
You're a big guy - For you
() Was being caught part of your plan
Of course
Dr
Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours
We had to know what he told you about us
Nothing
said nothing
Why not just ask him
He would not have told us
You have methods
Him,  need healthy
You present no such problem
Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit
heavy bass tone is rising
The Sergeant looks out the window
- The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane looming over it, dangerously close
5
,   - The plane lurches
The noise is building
Sir
Well congratulations, you got yourselves caught
What's the next step of your master plan
Crashing this plane
- The ramp of the transport opens
Four men leap out on tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each side
,   - The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane above
Man looks at Bane
() With no survivors
Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is outside the window
Bang - - Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted, unnaturally
,   - The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward
6
,   - Like lightning, Bane has the  Man is his handcuffed arms, legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends
Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks  Man's neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud
Dr
Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart
- The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles helplessly above the mountains
Its wings shear off
,   - Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down, by Dr
Pavel
- The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away, swinging out as the tail explodes
,   - An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables
body bag is lowered into the cabin
Bane lies it on the seat backs next to Dr
Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body the same age and build as Dr
Pavel
Bane rips Dr
Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr
Pavel's arm - runs the tube to the body's arm
Dr
Pavel watches, horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest, drawing Dr
Pavel's blood across the tube and into the body
An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and out
Bane stops Hooded Man 2
7
Friend
They expect one of us in the wreckage
The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm
2 Have we started the fire
() The fire rises
Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line
Bane clips it around Dr
Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr
Pavel's seat belt
Dr
Pavel panics, flails
Bane takes his arms
Gentle
Calm, Doctor
Now is not time for fear
Bane slides Dr
Pavel out of his seat
They hang in the vertical, windblown cabin
Bane takes out a detonator
That comes later
Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below
Dr
Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport, and we - : - Drifting over the vast city
(
) Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday
moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge
(
) But we're here tonight because it's one of the most important
over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side
8
(
) Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago
finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor
The Mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham
This city has seen a historic turnaround
No city is without crime
But this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob
Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act
And to them say
not on my watch
Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up
want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event
'm told Mr
Wayne couldn't be here tonight, but 'm sure he's with us in spirit
High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure
Watching
(
) Now 'm going to give way to an important voice
Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some sheets of densely written paper
Congressman muscles in
Commissioner
Congressman
Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things
Gordon shakes his head
Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley, cuts in
9
No one has
Not in years
(
) He can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape
thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man - (Turns to picture of Dent
) And murdered him in cold blood
The Congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them
She freezes
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow
(turns, tight smile) Shrimp balls
The Congressman grabs two
The Maid moves off
The Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers
(
) Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent
Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech
We're gonna be here all night
Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't so simple, Congressman
(
) But 'll let him tell you himself - Commissioner Gordon
Applause
Gordon approaches the mike
Looks down at his long speech
Thinks
The truth
: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens Gordon's son with a handgun
10
Gordon surveys the audience
Deciding
have written a speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent
Gordon folds up his speech
Maybe the time isn't right
Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket
The Congressman mutters under his breath
Thank Christ for that
Maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act
These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized Gotham for so long
Maybe, for now, all  should say about Harvey Dent's death is this
it has not been for nothing
The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion
People clap as Gordon leaves the mike
Gordon approaches Foley
The second shift reports in
On your desk
But you should put in some more time with the Mayor - That's your department
Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive
Anyone shown him the crime stats
He goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers
Must be popular with the wife
11
Not really
She took the kids and moved to Cleveland
He'll have plenty of time for visits
Mayor's dumping him in the spring
Really
He's a hero
War hero
This is peacetime
Stay smart, the job's yours
,   - Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs - Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff
She overhears another Maid
2 They say he never leaves the East Wing
3 heard he had an accident - that he's disfigured
The other Maids signal her to be quiet
All the chatter has died
Alfred has entered the kitchen
Mr
Till, why are your people using the main stairs
Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered plate
Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen
Where's Mrs
Bolton
She's up at the bar, sir
Can help
Alfred looks at the Maid
Hands her a key and the tray
The East drawing room
Unlock the door, place the tray on the table, lock the door again
Nothing more
12
The Maid nods
Takes the tray
,   - Following the Maid through the empty house
She comes to the large oak door to the East Wing
Unlocks it
,  ,   - The room is dark, quiet
The Maid places the tray on the table
She looks at the inner door opposite
It is ajar
,   - Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate
'm sorry, Miss Tate, but 've tried
He won't see you
It's important, Mr
Pennyworth
Her accent is European
Hard to place
Mr
Wayne is as determined to ignore important things as trivial ones
(
) Don't take it personally, Miranda
They turn to see a man in his fifties
Daggett
Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in there with eight-inch nails, peeing into Mason jars
(To Alfred
) Good of you to let me on the grounds
The Dent Act is about all Gotham
Even you, Mr
Daggett
Miss Tate, always a pleasure
Alfred turns and walks off
Daggett smiles, glib
13
Why waste your time talking to the man who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project
He can't help you get your money back
But  can
could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not, is worth investing in, whatever the return
could try, Mr
Daggett, but you understand only money and the power you think it buys, so why waste my time, indeed
She walks away
Daggett watches her go
,  ,   - Close on the dinner tray
We hear a labored step approach
Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane
Gaunt
Grey temples
He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing something
He slowly limps into the next room
,  ,  , The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and Martha Wayne
Some are half-burned
She notices an archery target, arrows stuck in it
She reaches out
An arrow sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered
Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite bow
Picks up his cane
'm, 'm terribly sorry, Mr
Wayne
It is Mr
Wayne, isn't it
Wayne nods, gently
Limps towards her
Although you don't have the long nails
(Nervous laugh
) Or facial scars
She trails off, embarrassed
Coy
She seems very young
Is that what they say about me
14
It's just that
nobody sees you
Wayne approaches slowly
He nods at her pearl necklace
That's a beautiful necklace
Reminds me of the one that belonged to my mother
It can't be the same one - her pearls are in this safe - He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the bureau, revealing a safe door
- which the manufacturer clearly explained is uncrackable
which swings open with an awkward creak
Oops
No one told me it was uncrackable
The Maid suddenly seems more confident
Older
'm afraid  can't let you take those
She smiles at him
Moves towards him
Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any more than  would beat up a cripple
She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down
Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made
The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window
Goodnight, Mr
Wayne
She flips backwards through the window
Wayne smiles, then rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace
He looks at the safe, notices something
Powder
,   - Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and pearls
Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she slips into a town car
beside the Congressman
15
Can  have a ride
The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily
You read my mind
,   - Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe
Miss Tate was asking to see you again
She's very persistent
And quite lovely, in case you were wondering
wasn't
What are you doing
Examining print dust
We've been robbed
And this is your idea of raising the alarm
() She took the pearls
Tracking device and all
She
One of the maids, perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house
16
Perhaps you should learn to make your own bed, then
Why are you dusting for prints
'm not
She was
,    - Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles to read
Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight
(
) Sir
young Cop is standing there
This is Blake
didn't want to bother you up here, but they're looking for you
What's the problem, son
Congressman Gilly's wife's been calling
He hasn't made it home from the Wayne Foundation event
That's a job for the police
Sir, 've been a cop for a year and 've only logged half a dozen arrests
When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good
Pretty soon we'll be chasing overdue library books
Gordon smiles at this
Blake looks at his stack of files
But here you are
Like we're still at war
Old habits
17
Or instinct
What's your name, son
Blake, sir
You have something you want to ask me, Officer Blake
It's that night
This night, eight years ago
The night Dent died
What about it
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman
He murders those people, takes out two  teams, breaks Dent's neck
then just vanishes
'm not hearing a question, son
Blake shifts uneasily
Then looks at Gordon
Don't you want to know who we was
Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight
He brushes his fingers across its rusted shell
know exactly who he was
(Turns to Blake
) He was Batman
Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs
(
) Let's go see about the Congressman's wife
18
,   - Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom
The bed is empty
Master Wayne
Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion
No reply
,   - Alfred hits three notes on the piano
The bookcase opens
- Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor
- Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to lower, becoming a ramp
At the bottom, Alfred is level with a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube
You haven't been down here in a long time
Just trying to find out more about our jewel thief
ran her prints from the photos she handled - Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery suspect
- but she was wearing someone else's fingerprints
She's good
She may be
But we have the trace on the necklace
We do, so  cross-referenced the address she went back to with police data on high-end -and-'s
Wayne hits a key
photograph of the Maid appears
Selina Kyle
The databases are full of close calls, tips from fences
19
Newspaper headlines appear - ,   '' She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet
We should send the police before she fences the pearls
She won't
She likes them too much
And they weren't what she was after
What was she after
My fingerprints
There was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe
Gives you a good pull, and it's untraceable
Fascinating
Maybe you should exchange notes over coffee
Now you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief
At this point, sir,  would set you up with a chimpanzee if  thought it would bring you back into the world
There's nothing out there for me
And that's the problem
You hung up the cape and cowl, but never moved on
You won't get out there and find a life
Find someone - () did find someone, Alfred
20
know
And then you lost them
That's part of living, sir
But you're not living - you're waiting
Hoping for things to go bad again
Wayne says nothing
Remember when you left Gotham
Before all this
Before Batman
Seven years you were gone
Seven years  waited
Hoping that you wouldn't come back
Wayne looks at Alfred
Not understanding
Every year  took my holiday
'd go to Florence
There's a cafe by the Arno
Any fine evening would sit there and order a Fernet Branca
: Alfred seated in a cafe sipping his drink
had a fantasy
liked to imagine that one day 'd look across the tables, and see you
Sitting there with your wife
Perhaps some kids
You wouldn't say anything to me, or me to you, but we'd both know
that you'd made it
That you were happy
: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks closer, hopeful
But they are strangers
never wanted you to come back to Gotham
knew there was nothing there for you but pain and tragedy, and  wanted more for you than that
still do
Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave
His bats
- Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car Man leads them down a long concrete trough
They wash up a couple times a month
More when in gets colder - homeless sheltering in the tunnels
We had to pull him to clear the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him
21
They come out by the catchment basin
Above the grille lies a body - a teenage boy
Blake looks down at him
Freezes
What
Name's Jimmy
He's at St
Swithin's
(Off look
) The boys home where
coach some ball
'    - Blake looks up at the shabby building
'    - Blake is talking to Father Reilly
Jimmy hadn't been here for months
Why
You know why, Blake - he aged out
We don't have the resources to keep boys on after sixteen - The Wayne Foundation gives money for that - Not for two years now
He has a brother here, right
Mark
'll tell him
'd like to, if that's okay
22
,
' - Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten
'm sorry
Mark nods slowly
Staring straight ahead
What was he doing in the tunnels
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out
Say you can live down there
Say there's work down there
What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers
More than you can find up here, guess
Blake considers this
Troubled
- Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk in a Hawaiian shirt
She sits him on a bar stool - walks over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits
You brought a date
like having someone around to open doors for me
Selina glances around
Things scattered throughout the bar
Jumpy
Selina hands an envelope to Stryver
Right hand
No partials
Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope
Holds it up to the light
Four perfect fingerprint transfers
23
Very nice
He pockets the envelope
Not so fast, handsome
You got something for me
Oh, yes
Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door
Another Thug joins them at the table
Selina smiles
don't know what you're going to do with Mr
Wayne's prints
but 'm guessing you'll need his thumb
As Stryver checks the envelope again - You don't count so good, huh
count fine
The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head
In fact, 'm counting to ten right now
Selina looks in his eyes
The Thug cocks his gun
She blinks
Okay, okay - She reaches for her purse
The Thug stops her, reaches in himself - pulls out a cellphone
Slides it across the table
My friend is waiting outside
Just hit 'send'
Stryver looks at the phone
Hits 'send'
Selina sizes up her options
knock on the door
Second Thug hides his gun
The door opens - a young woman, Jen
She enters, cheerful, spots Selina
Pulls out an envelope, looks around
24
Place is a little dead
(takes envelope, tense) It'll liven up in a minute, trust me
Everything okay
Great
Catch you later
Jen leaves
Stryver checks the envelope
Satisfied
It would've been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed
We can't have loose ends
And even in that dress, no one's going to miss you
No
But my friend over there
Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of nuts at the bar - he looks familiar
Every cop in the city's missing him
Across the bar, the  on mute - Stryver looks at Selina
Cute
But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this
don't know
You did just use his cell phone
Stryver glances down at the cell phone as -  - the Thugs look out the window at cop cars and  units descending on the bar
Stryver glances at the window and - - Selina  his head against the table, grabs 25
Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the other Thugs, who drop
The SWATs batter down the door
Selina crouches, cowering, screaming
It's alright, Miss
Just stay down The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back through the bar and out into the back alley
Selina smiles
- The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic weapons
- Selina moves to the door
Spots the Congressman under the bar, clutching his bleeding leg
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart
She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar
Moves for the door
() Call me
- Selina waltzes out - right into Blake
She feigns panic
There's a man in there - he's bleeding
It's okay, Miss
It's okay
Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a  truck
He heads into the bar, weapon drawn
Selina slips behind the truck and into the night
26
- Blake enters, gun drawn
Spots the Congressman
( ) 've got the Congressman - bullet to the leg, but he's okay
- The SWATs return fire
The Thugs lay down cover fire, then race around a corner into a smaller passage
cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon jumps out, gun drawn
The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners tactically
The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals, counting down
They round the corner, aiming low and high
The passage is empty
The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once - Manhole
He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover, Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest
You three, down with me
You two, head down to cover the next exit - Where -
Get the  down here, now
Gordon starts climbing down the ladder
- Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low
Three SWATs fall in behind
27
- Blake comes into the alley
Cops surround the manhole
Where's the  guy
They went down there
(shaking his head) And Gordon took  in after them
- Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the corner
SWATs return fire, shots sparking off the concrete walls, then -  - behind him the tunnel , blasting the SWATs
Gordon races forward, tearing through the tunnels
- Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole
- Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn
noise makes him turn - , he is clobbered from behind by a Thug
- Blake pushes forward
Come on, we gotta get down there - That was a gas explosion, kid - Gas
This is a sewer
No one goes in there till we know what's down there
28
We know what's down there, sir
The Police Commissioner
Somebody get the hothead out of here
And get me a  guy
Blake backs off
Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car
- Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back
1 This one's alive
(Looks closer
) Jesus
It's the Police Commissioner
2 What do we do
1 Take him to Bane
The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels
As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls and ceiling of the larger tunnels
Some of the men are armed Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids
They stare as Gordon is dragged past
The Thugs drag Gordon between two waterfalls, into - ' ,  -  () They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the firelight
Bare-chested, muscular, masked
Bane
crooked line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine
Why are you here
The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet
1 Answer him
Bane slowly turns to the Thugs
29
'm asking you
1 It's the Police Commissioner
And you brought him down here
2 We didn't know what to do
We - You panicked
And your weakness costs three lives
1 No, he's alone - Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack
Thug 1 drops
Bane turns to Thug 2
Search him
Then  will kill you
The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet, gun
and the folded papers of the speech he did not read
Bane takes these one by one with quick glances
He stops at the papers
Unfolds them
As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out
2 He's dead
Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers
Then show me his body
2 That water runs to any one of the outflows - we'd never find him
Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary
Give me your
Lead Mercenary hands him a  - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school
30
Follow him
2 Follow him
Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water
Turns to Lead Mercenary
Track him
Make sure both bodies will not be found
Then brick up the south tunnel
- Blake comes out to the catchment basin
He spots something stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the raging waters - Gordon is there, alive
Just
Blake pulls him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying
,   - Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform
need to see Bruce Wayne
'm sorry, Mr
Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls
Even from police officers
And if  go get a warrant, in the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder
Would that still count as unscheduled
,   - Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous
Wayne enters
What can  do for you, officer
Commissioner Gordon's been shot
31
'm sorry to hear that - He chased a gunman down into the sewers
When  pulled him out he was babbling about an underground army
masked man called 'Bane'
Shouldn't you be telling this to your superior officers
did
One of them asked if he saw any giant alligators down there
He needs you
He needs the Batman
If Commissioner Gordon thinks 'm the Batman he must be in a bad way He doesn't know or care who you are
(Off look
) But we've met before
When  was a kid
At the orphanage
See, my mom died when was small
Car accident,  don't really remember it
But a couple of years later my dad was shot over a gambling debt
remember that just fine
(Looks at Wayne
) Not a lot of people who know what it feels like, do they
To be angry
In your bones
People understand, foster parents understand
For a while
Then they expect the angry kid to do what he knows he can never do
To move on
To forget
Wayne stares at Blake
So they stopped understanding and sent the angry kid to a boys' home - St
Swithin's
Used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation
See, figured it out too late
You have to hide the anger
Practice smiling in the mirror
Like putting on a mask
You showed up one day in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm
() 32
(') We were so excited - Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan
We made up stories about you
Legends
The other boys' stories were just that
But when  saw you  knew who you really were
(Beat
) 'd seen that look on your face
Same one taught myself
Blake gets up to leave
Wayne is lost in thought
don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder, but 'm still a believer in the Batman
Even if you're not
Why did you say your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation
Because the money stopped
Might be time to get some fresh air and start paying attention to the details
Some of those details might need your help
,   - Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away
You checked that name
'Bane' - Ran it through some databases
He's a mercenary
No other known name
Never been seen or photographed without a mask
He and his men were behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett
Now Daggett's brought them here
It would seem so
'll keep digging
33
Alfred turns to leave
Why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city
The Foundation is funded from the profits of Wayne Enterprises
(Off look
) There have to be some
Time to talk to Mr
Fox,  think
'll get him on the phone - No
Do we still have any cars around the place
( ) One or two
And  need an appointment at the hospital
About my leg
Which hospital, sir
Whichever one Jim Gordon's in
Alfred is less excited by this part of the request
- Moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown
(
) Mr
Fox,  believe in what Mr
Wayne was trying to do
,   - Miranda is talking to Lucius Fox at the table
34
'm only asking for explanations because  think  can help
'll pass along your request
Next time  see him
Miranda catches something in this
He doesn't talk to you either
Let's just say that Bruce Wayne has his
eccentricities
() Mr
Fox, are you aware that John Daggett is trying to acquire shares in Wayne Enterprises
was not
But it wouldn't do him any good - Mr
Wayne still retains a clear majority
Miranda leaves
Fox moves into his office - stops
Bruce Wayne
As  live and breathe
Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane
What brings you out of cryo-sleep Mr
Wayne
see you haven't lost your sense of humor
even if you have lost most of my money
Actually, you did that yourself
See, if you funnel the entire  and budget for five years into a fusion project that you then mothball, your company is unlikely to thrive
35
Even with - wildly sophisticated , yes
Wayne Enterprises is running out of time
And Daggett is moving in
What're my options
If you're not willing to turn your machine on - can't, Lucius
Then sit tight
Your majority keeps Daggett at arm's length while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate - she's supported your project all the way
She's smart, and quite lovely
You too, Lucius
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce
Show her the machine
'll think it over
Anything else
No, why
These conversations always used to end with some
unusual requests
retired
Let me show you some stuff, anyway
Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden elevator
36
- Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space
They pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations
figured you'd have shut this place down
It was always shut down, officially
But all this new stuff
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up fourteen different defense subsidiaries
've spent years shuttering them and consolidating all the prototypes under one roof
My roof
Why
Stop them falling into the wrong hands
Besides,  thought someone might get some use out of them
Wayne shakes his head
Sure  can't tempt you to something
Pneumatic crampons
Infrared lenses
Least let me get you something for that leg
It's fine the use it gets these days
Well, then  have just the thing for an eccentric billionaire who doesn't like to walk
Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle
Wayne's eyes light up
37
Now you're just showing off
Defense Department project for tight-geometry urban pacification
Rotors configured for maneuvering between buildings without recirculation
What's it called
It has a long and uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation
So took to calling it the Bat
And yes, Mr
Wayne, it does come in black
Wayne touches its sleek side
Marveling
Works great except for the autopilot
What's wrong with that
Software-based instability
Take a better mind than mine to fix it
Better mind
was trying to be modest
less busy mind
Yours, perhaps
Wayne looks wistfully at the machine
Turns away
told you
retired, Lucius
,    - Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an -ray
've seen worse cartilage in knees 38
That's good - No, that's because there is no cartilage in your knee
And not much of any use in your elbows and shoulders
Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys, residual concussive damage to your brain tissue and general scarred-over quality of your body
(Takes a deep breath
) cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing
About the only part of your body that looks healthy is your liver, so if you're bored recommend you take up drinking, Mr
Wayne
Wayne smiles
The Doctor leaves
Wayne pulls on a ski mask, steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane, which he clips to his belt
He props his cane behind the frame - jumps out
The wire unspools from the cane as - ,    - Wayne drops three floors
,   - Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines
Wayne, in ski mask, stands over him
Gordon's eyes flutter open
He tries to speak with a weak, hoarse voice
We were in this together
Then you were gone
The Batman wasn't needed anymore
We won
Built on a lie
Our lie
Now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it
Nobody will listen
The Batman has to come back
39
What if he doesn't exist anymore
He must
He must
/
- Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town houses
Checks a tracking device
Jon, provocatively dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door
'  - Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out
She picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall
(
) told you - money first - (
) Goddammit, you took my wallet
'  - The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm
But Selina has grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip
Get out
She took my wallet
Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move
Now
She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs
Selina turns to Jen
Who is examining a wallet
told you not to try it with the assholes, Jen
They're all assholes
40
Okay, the assholes who hit
don't know what he's so upset about, he only had sixty bucks in here
Probably the watch
Watch
Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex
' ,  ,  - Selina exits and hails a cab
Wayne watches her go
Then pulls out
Checking his tracker
,  - Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade
Wayne pulls up to the Valet
Paparazzi line the entrance
Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini
Another stiff too old to climb out of his sports car
2 No, that's Bruce Wayne
Hey, Wayne, where you been hiding
Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob - a pulse
The cameras die
Wayne heads to the door
'm not sure if my assistant put me on the guest list - Right through here, Mr
Wayne
41
- lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling confetti
Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation
He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit
She wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears
And the pearls
(
) Bruce Wayne at a charity ball
Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her only concession to fancy dress
Miss Tate, isn't it
Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things
True
Proceeds go to the big fat spread, not the cause
It's not about charity, it's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid it on
Actually, this is my party, Mr
Wayne
Oh
And the proceeds will go where they should, because  paid for the big fat spread myself
That's very generous of you
You have to invest to restore balance to the world
Take our clean-energy project
Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off
Sorry
42
You have a practiced apathy, Mr
Wayne
But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune on a plan to save it
(Gentle
) And isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding
Wayne looks at Miranda
Intrigued
Have a good evening, Mr
Wayne
Wayne watches Miranda glide away
Then turns to Selina
Mind if  cut in
Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane
Takes Selina by the waist
She glares at him
You don't seem very happy to see me
You were supposed to be a shut-in
Felt like some fresh air
Why didn't you call the police
have a powerful friend who deals with this kind of thing
(Admires her cat ears
) Brazen costume for a cat burglar
Yeah
Who are you pretending to be
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire
Who's your date
His wife's in Ibiza
She left her diamonds behind, though
Worried they'd get stolen
43
It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'
You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook not a social climber
(flash of anger) You think  care what anyone in this room thinks about me
doubt you care what anyone in this room thinks about you
Don't condescend, Mr
Wayne
You don't know a thing about me
Well, Selina Kyle,  know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town - modest place for a master jewel thief
Which means either you're saving for your retirement - or you're in deep with the wrong people
You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor
Actually,  was born in the Regency Room
started off doing what  had to
Once you've done what you had to they'll never let you do what you want to
Start fresh
There's no fresh start in today's world
Any twelve-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did
Everything we do is collated and quantified
Everything sticks
We are the sum of our mistakes
44
Or our achievements
The mistakes stick better
Trust me
You think that justifies stealing
take what  need to from those who have more than enough
don't stand on the shoulders of people with less
Robin Hood
'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room
Than you
Maybe you're assuming too much
Or maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet
Ouch
You think all this can last
Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party
There's a storm coming, Mr
Wayne
You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little to the rest of us
Sounds like you're looking forward to it
45
'm adaptable
These pearls do look better on you then they did in my safe
Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back of her neck, unclasps the necklace
But  still can't let you keep them
The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand
Selina looks at him
Angry
Then kisses him, hard, and disappears into the crowd
Wayne's cane reappears
() You scared her off
Not likely
- Wayne approaches the Valet
Pats down his pockets
must have lost my ticket - Your wife said you were taking a cab home, sir
My wife
/
- Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the engine
- Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back
Just you, sir
Wayne gives him a withering glare
() 46
(') Don't worry, Master Wayne
Takes a little time to get back into the swing of things
Wayne dials his phone
(
) This is Fox
Remember those 'unusual requests' used to make
(
) knew it
Up front, Alfred listens
Concerned
- Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee - the brace tones
As Wayne starts moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a Thermos
You've got the wrong leg, sir
You start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns
Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee
Puts his weight on it - the knee bends, kicks
He sits again
Cautious
Now we tighten it up
Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in
Wayne grits his teeth
It is terribly painful
( ) You're welcome to try it, Alfred
Happy watching, thank you, sir
Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home
He gets to his feet
47
Not bad - Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick
Not bad at all
Alfred picks up the brick
Considers it
Uneasy
He follows Wayne across the bridge to the cube
Master Wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding Bane
'm all ears
There is a prison
In a more ancient part of the world
pit
Where men are thrown to suffer and die
But sometimes, a man rises from the darkness
Sometimes
the pit sends something back
Bane
Born and raised in a hell on earth
Born in a prison
No one knows why
Or how he escaped
But they know who trained him one he did
's al Gh l
Your mentor
Wayne takes this in
Shocked
He plucked Bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance
Just like you
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows
48
Until he was excommunicated
And a man considered too extreme for  's al Gh l is not to be trifled with
didn't realize  was known for trifling with criminals
That was then
And you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on
But it won't make you what you were
Which was
Someone whose anger at death made him value all life
Even his own
If this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me
The Batsuit emerges from the cube
Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne
Your resources, your knowledge
not your body
Not your life
That time has passed
tried helping as Bruce Wayne, Alfred
And  failed
You can fail as Bruce Wayne
As Batman, you can't afford to
That's what you're afraid of - that if  go back out there 'll fail
No
'm afraid that you want to
Wayne looks at Alfred
Then turns to examine the Batsuit
49
- frenzy of trading on the packed floor
Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby
2 You can't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party - 1 Wayne coming back is change
Change is either good or bad
2 On what basis
1 flipped a coin
Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing there negotiating with a Trader
3 No
Rye
told 'em rye
Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen
Alright, 'll take it
He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted
At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters, wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his face
Rookie
Lose the helmet
(Points at a camera
) We need faces for cameras
In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of the way of two Traders who rush in to pee
At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the man shining his shoes without a glance
Shoeshine Man takes the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a gym bag and checks an automatic weapon
He clicks the slide home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading floor
At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet
The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide
50
In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag
Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying
Shoeshine Man moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon
Under the Courier's helmet - a mask
Bane
He grabs the Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues, lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality
Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens
The floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck, screaming
Bane moves onto the floor
1 This is a stock exchange, there's no money you can steal - He dries up as Bane stops
Turns to him
Why else would you people be here
Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the floor to an online automated trades terminal
He puts the man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up
Enter your password
Or  send these men to your home
Trader 1, terrified, types in his password
Outside, sirens
Shoeshine man pulls out a  drive with an antenna - plugs it into the computer - figures race across the screen
- Police vehicles screech into the narrow street - construction vehicles are blocking
Blake argues with a burly Construction Worker
Move it, now
We've got a situation
Where can  move it
That way
Blake points - but  vehicles pile in, blocking
51
Get in your vehicle and stay there
Foley and the  Commander, Allen, approach the entrance
The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic
You've gotta get in there
This is a hostage situation - It's a robbery
They've got direct access to the online trading desk
'm not risking my men for your - It's not our money, it's everyone's
Really
Mine's in my mattress
If you don't shut these guys down, the stuffing in that mattress might be worth a whole lot less, pal
Cut the fiber line - shut down the cell tower
That'll slow them down
- Shoeshine Man looks up from the laptop
They cut the fiber
Cell's working
For now
How much longer does the program need
Eight minutes
52
Time to go mobile
Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack
- Allen shouts at his men
Get the barriers up - no more in and out on this street
Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the street
Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope
Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people
've got something - The door explodes
SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering
Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase
- The bikes weave through traffic, Traders strapped to the back, facing backwards - screaming, ties flying in the wind
cruiser falls in behind
Shoot the tires
Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way
No shot
- Foley is barking into his radio
Back off, back off
They've got hostages
53
/
- The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel
Rookie Cop looks up into his rear-view
What's going on with the lights
The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are dying one after another
The darkness is chasing them - the darkness hits them
Their lights, sirens, and engine die
And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past - It can't be
The hell was that
Oh boy
You're in for a show tonight, son
- Food Guy drives the rear bike
He looks back - sees streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up
The engine chokes and dies
The Trader jumps off, shouting for the cops
Food Guy turns, pulling his gun
- Food Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as races by on the Bat-Pod
- Foley rushes to Blake's cruiser
Let's roll, they've spotted the Batman
- The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass
54
- Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a rifle-shaped device
tone builds - he aims it at the bike and fires
- - Janitor's bike sparks and dies
Sirens as Cops move in, Another bike splutters and dies - the Hostage breaks for cover
- Batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an overpass
He holsters his  rifle and guns the Bat-Pod
'  - Foley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command station
( ) Call everyone in - every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too
Pull 'em in, close every street
Now
Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by
'm gonna do what Gordon never could
What's that
'm gonna take down the Batman
Sir, what about the armed robbers
Foley ignores him
55
- All around the city, cops mobilize - cars, vans, choppers
- Bane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man
Shoeshine Man glances inside his pack - signals '2'
Bane turns, sees darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage, lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Man's bike
Bane peels off - Batman stays on Shoeshine Man
- Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio
( ) One bike's pulled off, no hostage - '  - Foley listens to the radio, hungry - ( ) Should we pursue
Negative
Stay on the Batman
But he's getting away
() Who do you want to catch
Some robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who killed Harvey Dent
'  - Coverage of the pursuit blares from all the TVs, as Daggett and Stryver watch
Tense
People aren't saying much - frankly, they're too busy - but all signs suggest that what we're () 56
(cont'd) seeing is, in fact, the return of the Batman
, '  - Moving in on a shadow, crouched in front of Daggett's safe, working the dial
The shadow slides up a pair of goggles onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat ears
It is Catwoman
She turns to the , watching the pursuit
Well, what do you know
Catwoman opens the safe
Nothing inside
She frowns
- Bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the Batman
He jumps up onto a concrete barrier, then down to the mouth of an outflow pipe
He glances at the entire Gotham Police Department descending on one man
Disappears into the pipe
- Shoeshine Man glances into his pack - the program beeps, finished
He looks back to see the Bat-Pod racing at him, ducks as it comes alongside
riderless
Shoeshine Man looks up, confused
His hostage is ripped off the bike by a low-flying dark shape
Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks, rolls off dazed
Batman grabs him
Shoeshine Man stares
Unafraid
Batman rips the computer from his pack
The screen reads: Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens everywhere
Batman grabs the  drive from the laptop
He jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in
57
( ) Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic
An empty car transporter is below the on-ramp
Batman fires the cannons at the transporter, the near ramp crashes down, and Batman roars towards it - mounts it and jumps onto the on-ramp
'  - Daggett angrily grabs some ice cubes for his drink
After eight years he has to pick tonight
He's drawing the cops off Bane
Daggett watches, intrigued
'  - Foley shouts down the phone
How did you let him go
( ) He's got a lot of firepower - And you don't
We're not letting one nut with a bad attitude and some fancy gadgets run this town down, you hear me
( ) He's heading back downtown
() Then he's as dumb as he dresses - close it down, gentlemen
58
- Thousands of police jockey to pursue the Batman as he races back into the downtown area
- The Bat-Pod tears along, pursued by a phalanx of cruisers, choppers overhead
More cops appear at the far end of the boulevard
The Bat-Pod executes a ninety-degree turn, flipping over as it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley
Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley
Blake arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck
Foley swaggers out
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen
Foley reaches for a loudhailer
noise from the alley that none of the cops have heard before
You might have the wrong animal there, sir - Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground
The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham Blake slides up to Foley
Dry
Are you sure that was him
Foley looks at Blake
Thrusts the loudhailer at him
- Gordon, still hooked up to machines, watches
He smiles
( ) Police are keeping quiet about the prospect of a return by the Batman, but eyewitness accounts seem the clearly suggests the type of
59
'  - Daggett watches the  coverage, concerned
Stryver enters
Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished
What about the men they arrested
He says, and  quote, they would die before talking
() Where does he find these guys
Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner office
Open the champagne
, '  - Daggett comes through the door, calling back
And can we get some girls in here
(
) Careful what you wish for
Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room
His back slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but -
- Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using the high heel of her boot
He whimpers as she leans in
Cat got your tongue
She plucks the gun from his trembling hand
You dumb bitch
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb
60
Dumb to show up here tonight
want what you owe me - Click - Stryver has a gun to her head
' want' never gets
Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her leg
Nice outfit
those heels make it tough to walk
Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard
He screams
don't know, do they
Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett
So where is it
Where's what
The program
The 'Clean Slate'
Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a master thief with a record
don't have it
The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn
Catwoman, holding Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her heel
The glass shatters
She pulls Daggett through the window
He screams - they drop
-  - ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform
Catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down the side of the building
61
- Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him
Where is it
The 'Clean Slate'
Type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database
Little too good to be true
You're lying
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage - That's why  bought them
But they had nothing
It was a gangland myth
Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in
Shapes drop onto the rooftop
Emerge from fire exits
They're not Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men
Catwoman holds Daggett by the throat, threatening him
Stay back
They continue to approach
One of them screws a silencer onto his gun
'm not bluffing
(
) They know
All eyes search for the source of the voice
Catwoman spots it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman
They just don't care
As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun
Batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she fires at one, clipping him, he drops
She spins aiming at another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the Mercenary
Batman takes him out with a kick
62
You've got to be kidding
No guns
No killing
Where's the fun in that
As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for the far edge
Come on
Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof
She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley - sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open
Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit
As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above
My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men - This isn't a car
Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind
Bane
He watches the Bat roar off into the night
, ,  - The Bat lands - the canopy opens
Catwoman jumps out
See you around - Batman steps down after her
You're welcome
had it under control
63
Those weren't street thugs - they were trained killers
saved your life
In return  need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints
Catwoman looks at him
Considering
Wayne wasn't kidding about a 'powerful friend'
sold his prints to Daggett
For something that doesn't even exist
doubt many people get the better of you
Hey, when a girl's desperate
What were they going to do with them
don't know
But Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market
Batman considers this
police chopper sweeps past, searching
Batman turns to it
Then turns back
Miss Kyle -
But she is gone
So that's what that feels like
- Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing at the stock exchange
roar builds - the waterfall glows brighter until
The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying water
Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out
Alfred brushes water off his suit
Very inconspicuous
Shall  tell the neighbors you got yourself a new leaf-blower
64
We bought all the neighbors
Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk
From the look of the television coverage, you seem to have your taste for wanton destruction back
(pulls out  drive) retrieved this
Shouldn't the police be gathering the evidence
They don't have the tools to analyze it
They would if you gave them to them One man's tool is another man's weapon
In your mind, perhaps
But there aren't many things you couldn't turn into a weapon
Alfred
Enough
The police weren't getting it done - Perhaps they would've if you haven't made a sideshow of yourself
Perhaps you're upset you were wrong
Wrong
65
You thought  didn't have it in me
Alfred looks at him
Puts down the cape and cowl
You don't
You lead a bloated police force on a merry chase with some fancy new toys from Fox
What about when you come up against him
What then
Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing
'll fight harder,  always have
When you had something to fight for
What are you fighting for now
Not your life
Wayne moves to switch off the monitor
Alfred grabs his hand
Take a good look
At his speed, his ferocity, His training
see the power of belief
Of the fanatic see the League of Shadows resurgent
You said he was excommunicated
By  's al Gh l
Who leads them now
's al Gh l was the League of Shadows
And  beat him
Bane's just a mercenary, and we have to find out what he's up to
Wayne plugs the  in, hits keys
Text scrolls
Trades of some kind
Coded
The screen blanks, a thumb print appears
66
Is that -
Mine
Courtesy of Selina Kyle
Wayne pulls out the , rises
Get this to Fox - he can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing
Alfred looks at Wayne
Takes the
,   -  () As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls
'll get this to Fox
But no more
Wayne hears his tone of voice
Turns to him
've sewn you up and set your bones
but  won't bury you
've buried enough members of the Wayne family
You'd abandon me
You see only one end to your story
Leaving is all  have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore - you have to find another way
You used to talk about finishing
About life beyond that awful cave - Rachel died knowing we'd decided to be together
That was my life beyond this cave and  can't just move on
She didn't
She couldn't
Alfred considers this
Looks away
What if he had
What if she wasn't intending to make a life with you
67
She was,  can't change that - What if, before she died, she'd written a letter
Explaining that she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you
Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say - And what if, to spare you pain
'd burned that letter
Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked
Why would you say such a thing
Because  have to make you understand
You're lying
Because you are as precious to me as you were to your own mother and father and  swore to them that would protect you and  haven't
You're lying
've never lied to you
Except when burned Rachel's letter
Wayne turns on the old man, furious
How dare you use Rachel to stop me
'm using the truth, Master Wayne
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and just let it have its day
'm sorry
68
Sorry
You expect to destroy my world, then shake hands
No
know what this means - What does it mean, Alfred
It means your hatred
It means losing the person 've cared for ever since  heard his first cries echo through this house
But it might also mean saving your life
And that is more important
Wayne looks at Alfred
Furious
Summons the worst thing to say and says it quietly and calmly
Goodbye, Alfred
() Goodbye, Bruce
Wayne mounts the stairs
Alfred watches him go
Turns
,   - Wayne is woken by the doorbell
,   - As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing gown, he can't resist one tentative
Alfred
But Alfred is gone
,   - Wayne opens the front door the find Fox
Fox is surprised
69
Answering your own door
Yes
Could you decode the trades on that drive
Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline: didn't need to
Page three
Wayne turns the page: -
It seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange
Verified by thumb print
The options expired at midnight last night
Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling
Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now
you're completely broke
And Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett
The weapons - we can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences - Applied Sciences is shut up tight, and off the books
The energy project is a different story
Miranda Tate
We need to convince the board to get behind her
Let's show her the reactor - We're meeting her there in thirty-five minutes
You better get dressed
70
- scrapyard on the Gotham river
Across the water, the towers of Gotham
Lucius leads Miranda from her car
You brought me out here to show me a rubbish dump, Mr
Fox
Bear with me, Miss Tate
They arrive at a Portakabin and enter
- Miranda looks around the derelict office
Fox smiles at her
Keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times
He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked as the office becomes an elevator into - ,   - They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel
This is it, isn't it
The reactor is beneath the river so that it could be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid
'm gonna plead the fifth on that one
Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator
She spots a figure deep within: Bruce Wayne
thought you might like to see what your investment built
71
No radiation, no fossil fuels
Free, clean energy for an entire city
If it worked
It doesn't
Wayne leads Miranda to the core
Two perpendicular rings of electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal
Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold
Ignition, yes
But no chain reaction
You've built a lot of security around a damp squib
Nothing
About three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions
One week later your reactor started developing problems
(Looks at Wayne
)  think this machine works
Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great
Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago
Someone else will work out what Dr
Pavel did
Someone else will figure out how to turn this power source into a nuclear weapon
need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor
And to do what with it
Nothing
Until we can find a way to guarantee its safety
72
And if we can't
Decommission it
Flood it
Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future
If the world's not ready
Yes
Bruce, if you want to save the world you have to start trusting it
'm trusting you
Doesn't count
You have no choice
could've flooded this chamber any time in the last three years
'm choosing to trust you, Miranda, and that's not the easiest thing for me
Please
His eyes are genuine
Pleading
Miranda nods
We have a board meeting to get to
,   - The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their seats
Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other
'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here
Highly irregular, even if it is his family name above the door
All eyes go to Wayne
An older member of the board pipes up
Bruce Wayne's family built this - 73
2 And he himself has run it - Into the ground, sir
Anybody disagree
Check the value of your shares this morning
Gambling on crazy futures didn't just lose Mr
Wayne his seat, it's lost us all a lot of money
He needs to leave
'm afraid he has a point, Mr
Wayne
understand
Ladies and gentlemen
Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him
Wayne leaves
Let's get down to business
Right away
,   - Wayne exits the building
There is an angry mob of Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters
Wayne, how's it feel to be one of the people
'm sorry, sir, they had paperwork Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed
(
) Looks like you need a lift
Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car
Nods
74
'  - Daggett bursts in, furious
Stryver tries to placate him
How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board
Was she meeting with Wayne
Was she sleeping with Wayne
Not that we know of - Clearly you don't 'know of' anything, do you
Where's Bane
We told him it was urgent - Then where is the masked - (
) Speak of the devil
Daggett turns
Bane is already there
and he shall appear
What the hell's going on
The plan is proceeding as expected
You see me running Wayne Enterprises
(Moves towards Bane
) Your stock exchange hit didn't work, friend
And now you've got my construction crews working all hours around the city
How's that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne's
( ) Leave us
75
You stay right there
'm in charge
Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder
Do you feel in charge
Daggett is taken aback
Stryver leaves
've paid you a small fortune - And that gives you power over me
Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder
Nervous
What is this
Your money and infrastructure have been important
Till now
What are you
Gotham's reckoning
Come to end the borrowed time you've all been living on
Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his hands
You are true evil
am necessary evil
Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches
76
/
- Wayne stares out the window
Blake glances across
When you began
why the mask
To protect the people closest to me
You're a loner with no family
There are always people you care about
You just don't realize how much until they're gone
(Collects himself
) The idea was to be a symbol
Batman could be anybody, that was the point
It was damn good to see him back
Not everybody agrees
They'll figure it out in the end
Got anything on Bane's whereabouts
Yeah, 've got five hundred pages of tunnel records and a flashlight
could use some help
() You know what
Drop me in Old Town
' ,  ,  - Blake drops Wayne off
Don't wait
'll get a cab
77
You got money
(smiles, sheepish) Actually, no
Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street
The radio squawks
Blake reacts - drives off
'  - Selina is packing a bag
She hears voices in the stairwell
(
) told you, money first
(
) don't think so
'  - Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen
He's not a mark
Jen looks at Selina
At Wayne
And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway
'  - Wayne looks at the cramped space
Selina shifts, embarrassed
Yeah, it's not much
(Smiles
) But it's more that you've got right now
Actually, they're letting me keep the house
( ) The rich don't even go broke same as the rest of us, huh
78
(spots her bag) Vacation
Let's just say that 've incurred the wrath of some people less susceptible to my charms than you
My powerful friend hopes to change your mind about leaving
And how would he do that
By giving you what you want
It doesn't exist
He says it does
He wants to meet
Tonight
Why
He needs to find Bane
He thinks you'd know how
Tell him 'll think about it
Wayne nods, starts to leave
Mr
Wayne
'm sorry they took all your money
No, you're not
- Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for - 79
- Blake enters
Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley
Can we help you, officer
John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago
thought you might like to know
Why
Because Daggett's name is all over the permits  pulled to map the tunnels under Gotham
Blake hands Gordon a stack of files
Foley glares at Blake
maintenance, sewer construction
( ) Where did you get to with the tunnel searches
( ) Remind me to tell the detail to keep hotheads out
(To Gordon
) We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network - Get more men, work a grid
want him found
Yeah, yeah - the masked man
We're on it
Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake
This is good work
Lose the uniform - you're working for me now
We could use some hotter heads around here
80
This could just be a coincidence
You're a detective now, son, you're not allowed to believe in coincidence anymore
Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley
-  (  ) Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the driveway in the rain
Steps into the alcove
Hits the bell
(
) Nobody's answering
Wayne turns to find Miranda there
No
'm on my own now
Do you have keys
Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden
Never needed them
She takes his hand
Let's find a window
,   -  (  ) They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the rain
Fox worked the board like you've never seen - 'm in, Daggett's out and he's not happy
Wayne sets down the newspaper: 81
Hope you don't like me for your money
Miranda kicks off her shoes
Glances at the paper
Suffering builds character
Then at a photo of Wayne's parents
'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce
Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel
Who's this
Wayne looks at her
Can't find words
Where's Alfred
He left
Taking everything
Miranda puts the photo down
Kisses him
Passionately
Then again
He kisses back
Suddenly the lights go out
What's that
() think my power's been shut off
-  () Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire
You're pretty good at that
When  was a child we had almost nothing
But on the nights we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed
She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them
82
assumed your family was wealthy
Not always
Not when  was young
He traces a scar on her shoulder
An old mistake
've made a few myself
She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest
More than a few
(Smiles
) We could leave
Tonight
Take my plane
Go anywhere we wanted
Someday perhaps
Not tonight
She pulls him close
He kisses her
They fold into each other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room
,   - Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket
Wayne studies her for a moment, then slips out
- Wayne moves to the Batsuit
Picks up the cowl
- The Bat roars towards downtown
Batman kills the lights and main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons
- Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by
She senses
Don't be shy
Batman is there
83
Wayne says you can get me the 'Clean Slate'
That depends
On what
On what you want it for
acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands
Still don't trust me, huh
How can we change that
Start by taking me to Bane
() You asked
Catwoman jumps down
Batman follows
Catwoman leads him down into a service tunnel
- Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks
From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels
and they are not your average brawlers
Neither am
Catwoman swings into a - - Mercenary patrols
Catwoman comes up behind
He's behind you
84
() Who
Batman hangs upside down behind him
(
) Me
Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary
Gunfire in the tunnel
Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary
He is yanked off his feet by darkness - he screams
Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries
Screams echo
Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel
Just a little further
grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on
He is deep inside
' ,  - Mercenaries look down on him from above
Catwoman turns
had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me
You've made a serious mistake
(
) Not as serious as yours,  fear
Batman turns
Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls
Bane
Let's not stand on ceremony here, Mr
Wayne
Catwoman hears the name
Less sure of what she's done
Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches his fist
Peace has cost you strength
Victory has defeated you
85
Bane  Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk - Batman drops, uses his cape to land
Bane climbs down on a chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch
Theatricality and deception are powerful agents
to the uninitiated
Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce
The League of Shadows
And you betrayed us
Us
You were excommunicated
From a gang of psychopaths
Now  am the League of Shadows, here to fulfill  's al Gh l's destiny
Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them
Bane is not moving
Just taking the blows
Batman pauses
Bane's arms  ,  Batman aside - Bane
You fight like a younger man
Nothing held back
No reserves
Admirable
But mistaken
Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once
You think darkness is your ally
But you merely adopted the dark was born in it
Formed by it
In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike
didn't see the light until  was already a man
And by then it was nothing to me but blinding
86
Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in his grasp
The shadows betray you, because they belong to me
Bane  him into the ground, , pounding, pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it
Bane  from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes
will show you where 've made my home while preparing to bring justice
Then
will break you
Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions over his head as the ceiling  revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's weapons store
a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble
No
Your precious armory
Gratefully accepted
We will need it
- Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment
' ,  - Batman climbs to his feet, swaying
Bane approaches
wondered which would break first - your spirit
Batman  at him - misses - Bane  him, lifts him or your body
Bane brings Batman down onto his knee,  his back with a horrific
87
In the shadows, Catwoman looks on
Shocked
Bane crouches to pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne
Mercenaries lift Wayne's body and carry him off
Bane stares into the hollow eyes of his trophy
Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we - : - Blake's cruiser pulls up
He noses up to the windows
Nothing
' ,  ,  - Blake sits in his cruiser
Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat, bags
Blake recognizes her
She hails a cab
( ) Get Commissioner Gordon
Tell him 've got a line on the Congressman's kidnapping
Blake pulls out to follow
,    - Selina moves through the terminal
She clocks a Uniform Cop staring at her - ducks down a service hallway
,  - The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying make-up
Excuse me, Miss
need to see your ticket and identification, please
Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse
Would you mind
88
She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his head
,  - Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the far end - turns - Blake smiles at her
Badge in hand
,  - Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in
showed your picture to the Congressman and guess what
Don't tell me, still in love
Head over heels
Pressing charges, though
Blake lays a police file down with a thump
You've made some mistakes, Ms
Kyle
Girl's gonna eat
You have an appetite
Why run
You can't hide from us with this record
Maybe it's not you 'm running from
Who then
Bane
What do you know about him
() That you should be as afraid of him as  am
89
We can offer you protection
Selina looks at him with contempt
Blake shrugs, switches off the tape, moves to the door
When  spotted you,  was looking for a friend
Bruce Wayne
Selina turns to look at Blake
His eyes plead with her
Did they kill him
'm not sure
And we - : Sounds: screaming, laughing,
Sights: , bodies , a
And we are - - Wayne opens his eyes
Unshaven
Filthy
Someone else is in the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is painful
the skull drifts into his sight
Bane
Squatting at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask
Why didn't you just kill me
You don't fear death
You welcome it
Your punishment is to be more severe
() You're a torturer
Yes
But not of your body
Of your soul
Wayne exhales
Eyes losing focus from sheer pain
90
Where am
Home
Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison
Where  learned the truth about despair
As will you
(Rises
) There is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth
Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five hundred feet above
Like being at the bottom of a gigantic well
Hope
Every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom
So simple
So easy
And, like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying
learned that there can be no true despair without hope
(Turns to Wayne
) So as  terrorize Gotham,  will feed its people hope to poison their souls
will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun
Bane points to an old , just outside the bars
You will watch as  torture an entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again
Then, when you have truly understood the depths of your failure, we will fulfill  's al Gh l's destiny
We will destroy Gotham
And when it is done
when Gotham is ashes
then you have my permission to die
Bane rises
Leaves
Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness
- van pulls through the gate
Selina, inside the van, looks up at the formidable grey building
91
- Guards lead Selina down the cells
Whistles and catcalls
We're locking her up in here
The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need
First time she broke out of women's correctional she was sixteen
Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars
Little closer, baby
Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand
Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking
She'll be just fine
- Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda
don't see the need for a board meeting on the energy project - Bruce got a lot of things right
Keeping the board in the dark wasn't one of them
Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open
,   - The board is there
Scared
At the head of the table - Bane
This meeting is called to order
Fox and Miranda freeze
Staring at the mask
92
Chair and President
also need one ordinary member - Mr
Fox, would you care to nominate
No
volunteer
The dignified older board member gets to his feet
Mercernaries round the three up
Where are you taking us
Where you buried your resources
The bowels of Gotham
- Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated position as Blake watches
So you think our friend is gone again
() This time
he might not be coming back
Gordon takes this in
Foley bursts in, agitated
Okay, Commissioner, you were right
What's happened
Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board
He let most of them go, but took three down into the sewers
No more patrols, no more hide and seek
Send every available cop down there to smoke him out
93
The Mayor won't want panic - So it's a training exercise
Foley looks at Gordon
'm sorry for not taking you - Don't apologize for believing the world's in better shape then it is
just fight to make it true
Foley nods
Leaves
Blake gets up
Not you
You're telling me the Batman's gone
So you chase up the Daggett leads, any way you can
Blake nods
,   - Wayne lies, weak, feverish
Prisoner drips water onto his parched lips
An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue
He asks if you would pay us to let you die
told him you have nothing
Do it for the pleasure
The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips
They pay me more than that to keep you alive
chant gets Wayne's attention
He rolls his head painfully to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other Prisoners
94
He will try the climb
Strong Man starts scaling the wall
The Prisoners' chant grows stronger as he climbs towards the light
Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot leap from the rest of the climb
The chanting peaks as Strong Man leaps
misses
falls
The rope catches - he swings into the rock face
Prisoners fall silent as Strong Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor
Has anyone made it
Of course not
The Blind Prisoner barks at him
What does he say
He says there is one who did child
: a child of about ten looks up towards the light
child who had been born in this hell
Bane
An old legend
Nothing more
The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the
Don't
Whatever they want you to see
it's happening soon
95
' ,  - Bane's men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the debris
Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old inventions
- SWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels
- Bane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant charges on a hewn wall
Dr
Pavel is here
Waiting
Bane nods at his men
The wall blows
- team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing boom
They look at each other, then head in
Thousands of Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking weapons, using flashlights
- Bane leads the way over rubble into the
Dr
Pavel follows
Bane approaches the machine
Turns to Fox
Turn it on
Fox shakes his head
Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head
only need one other board member
There are eight more waiting upstairs
won't do it
Fredericks trembles
Bane cocks the weapon
Alright, stop
She walks up to the scanner
Places her hand on it
It beeps
She turns to Fox
Quietly pleading
96
Lucius, you'll kill this man and yourself, and barely slow them down
Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner
Then Fredericks
The core glows brighter and brighter
Dr
Pavel is transfixed
Do your work
Bane turns to his men
Gestures at the hostages
Take them to the surface
People of their status deserve to see the next era of western civilization
Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble
- The Mayor, flanked by Security, talks to a crowd of Reporters
We're seeing literally thousands of police heading into the sewers - training exercise, that's all
If you'll excuse me, 've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City
The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds
- Hundreds of SWATs wade, flashlights swinging, heading towards the center
Teams are converging from different entry points
/
- Blake is on the phone
've been to half Daggett's cement plants, logged locations they've poured for underground construction
97
(
) Anything strange about the pourings
Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations
Honestly, Commissioner,  don't know anything about civil engineering
But you know about patterns
Keep looking
Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant
- Dr
Pavel finishes his work
Turns to Bane
Grave
It's done
This is now a four-megaton nuclear bomb
(to his men) Pull the core out of the reactor
() You can't
This is the only power source capable of sustaning it - if you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months
Five, by my calculations
And then it will go off
For the sake of your family, Dr
Pavel,  hope so
Dr
Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the core
98
- Blake is led through a fence by a Worker
Boss is about to leave
Blake walks past cement mixers
Spots someone
Driver
Hey
The Driver turns
That was you outside the stock exchange, right
When
When
When half the city's cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck shut them out
Oh yeah
You're that cop - Detective, now
Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket
And as a detective
'm not allowed to believe in coincidences - Blake spins, drawing his weapon
The Worker lunges with a knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him
The Driver grabs him from behind
Blake wrestles, but the Driver is strong, trained
Blake can't aim his gun, he fires behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one catches the Driver in the back and he goes down
Blake, gasping, kneels beside the Driver
What were you doing
What
The man dies
Blake looks down at his gun
Disgusted
Tosses is down
Pulls out his phone
Dials
99
Commissioner, 'm at the Fourteenth Street plant with two dead witnesses and a lot of questions
Call me - Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun
Looking at some empty barrels
Commissioner, they've got Polyisobutylene here
(Looks around
) And motor oil
They weren't making cement, they were making explosives - /
- Blake grabs his carts - scanning the pattern of the dots - realizes
Oh, God
Blake fires up the cruiser and pulls out, hard
/
- Blake is driving furiously, shouting into the radio - Patch me into Foley
( ) Foley's overseeing the operation - They're heading into a trap
-   () Foley, concerned, takes the radio from a colleague
Foley
It's a trap
Pull everyone out
Bane's been pouring concrete laced with explosives - 100
Where
There's a ring around the tunnels - they're gonna blow it and trap the cops underground
Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel
Pull out
Pull 'em out
- Mercenaries rise from a hole in the floor - Bane emerges
- The Mayor, in a corporate box, mouths the National Anthem
- The Mercenaries pull out detonators
Bane listens to the kickoff like a hunting dog sensing the wind
decides
Let the games begin
The Mercenaries hit the detonators
- SWATs react - the tunnel roof behind collapses
Chunks of concrete structure drop - thousands of police throughout different tunnels are trapped
- The crowd goes wild as a Receiver catches - starts a run - the Mayor looks on, suddenly confused
As the Receiver sprints for the end zone, the field behind him  away in smoking ruins, swallowing Players
The crowd is not cheering but
The Mayor's box 101
The Receiver, nearing the touchdown, glances back - sees Armageddon - the entire field is now a smoking mass of rubble, but for one strip of turf
Mercenaries pour out of the tunnel, creating a gauntlet
/
- Blake's cruiser swerves to avoid eruptions of asphalt
An eruption  Blake's cruiser onto its roof
- All bridges, except the Gotham Bridge, suffer controlled demolitions
- Bane steps into the smoking stadium, a gladiator walking into the arena
cameras swing onto him
Passing a dead umpire, he takes the men's headset - surveys the screaming crowd, lifts an arm for silence, raises the mike to his mask
Gotham, take control of your city
/
- Blake squeezes out of his cruiser, reaches in for the radio
Foley
( ) Jesus, Blake
Every cop in the city's down in those tunnels
() Not every cop
Blake pulls the shotgun from his cruiser - flags down a car
102
- Gordon's heart-rate monitor alarms
Gordon wakes, groggy
- Patients and Doctors crowd the entrance
mercenaries with automatic weapons force their way in - hit the stairwell
/
- Blake drives, swerving around dazed and terrified people
Flames and smoke billow from the sewers
- Blake races up to the hospital entrance
,   - Two Mercenaries move room to room, searching
- Gordon pulls himself out of his bed, wheeling his
,  - Blake jumps into the corridor, gun raised
Shots echo down the hall - Blake sprints
- Blake leaps into the room, gun high - freezes as warm metal touches the base of his skull
(
) Clear the corners, rookie
Blake turns
Gordon holds his service weapon
The Mercenaries are on the ground, dead
Get my coat, son
103
- Mercenaries pull the glowing core onto the field
This is the instrument of your liberation
- Analysts and military personnel assess the situation
Satellite shows a radiation spike
2 Whatever it is
it's nuclear
- The Mercenaries thrust Dr
Pavel to his knees before Bane
Identify yourself to the world
Dr
Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist
Bane turns Dr
Pavel's head for the cameras
- Armed Forces and Intelligence staff scramble to verify
Pavel was confirmed dead - plane crash on an Agency pull-out of Uzbekistan
But it certainly looks like him - He points to a monitor with a photo of Dr
Pavel
An Air Force General rubs his chin, thinking, nervous
104
- -22's streak over the river, sizing up the island
- Bane rests his powerful hand on Dr
Pavel's shoulder
Tell the world what this is
fully primed neutron bomb
With a blast radius of six miles
And who can disarm this device
Only me
Thank you, Doctor
Bane snaps Dr
Pavel's neck in front of the world
The bomb is armed, the bomb is mobile, the identity of the triggerman is a mystery
One of you holds the detonator - we come not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people
At the first sign of interference from the outside world or of people attempting to flee, this anonymous Gothamite, this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb
For now, martial law is in effect
Return to your homes, hold your families close, and wait
Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours
Bane turns, leaves the field, followed by his men
- The General breaks the silence
105
Pull back the fighters, start high-level reconnaissance flights
And get the President on the line
- Mercenaries hold the bridge
tank rolls across from the mainland, soldiers behind
The Lead Mercenary uses a bullhorn
Tanks and planes cannot stop us detonating our device
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication
Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge
How many of you are there, son
(Nothing
) You don't have enough men to stop twelve million people leaving that island
We don't
But you do
Why in the hell would we help you keep your hostages
If people start crossing this bridge Gotham gets blown to hell
The Captain considers this
Troubled
- As night falls the -22's peel away from the fire-ringed city
The voice of the President echoes across the airwaves
( ) The people of our greatest city are resilient
They have proven this before, they will prove this again
106
,   - Wayne stares at the old
At his burning city
( ) We do not negotiate with terrorists, but we do recognize realities
Wayne starts to cry
-  () Blake drives the deserted streets
Gordon is slumped in the passenger seat, listening
( ) As the situation develops, one thing must be understood above all others
People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you
What does that mean
It means we're on our own
have to get in front of a camera - Sir, they'll kill you the second you show your face - The Mayor's dead
'm the symbol of law and order
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people - they need to know that  could lead
Bane's not gonna let that happen - Then he'll show his true colors
And you'll be dead
Gordon says nothing
107
- Three camouflage Tumblers roll down the deserted street
- crowd of news crews has gathered
Guards in the towers look down, apprehensive
The Tumblers roll up, stopping in front of the gates
Bane emerges from the lead Tumbler
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression
Blackgate Prison
,   - Prisoners strain to hear Bane's words
Selina is there
(
) Where a thousand men have languished for years
Under the Dent Act
Under the name of this - - Bane holds up a photo of Harvey Dent
Harvey Dent
Held up to you, and over you, as a shining example of justice and good
'  - Gordon sits watching Bane's speech
Blake gathers supplies
We're gonna keep moving you, till we can get you in front of a camera - Bane sets fire to the picture of Dent
108
But they supplied you a false idol
straw man
To placate
To stop you tearing down this corrupt city
,   - The Prisoners start cheering, shouting
(
) and rebuilding it the way it should have been rebuilt generations ago
- Bane drops the burning picture
Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent
In the words of Gotham's Police Commissioner, James Gordon
'  - This gets Blake's attention
Gordon watches, uneasy
- Bane unfolds the pages of Gordon's undelivered speech
'The truth about Harvey Dent is simple in only one regard - it has been hidden for too long
After his devastating injuries, Harvey's mind has recovered no better than his mutilated face
He was a broken, dangerous man, not the crusader for justice that , James Gordon, have portrayed him to be for the last eight years
Harvey's rage was indiscriminate
Psychopathic
He held my family at gunpoint, then fell to his death in the struggle over my son's life
The Batman did not murder Harvey Dent - he saved () 109
(') my boy
Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes, so that could, to my shame, build a lie around this fallen idol
' '  - Blake stares at the , Gordon's face lowers into his hands
(
) ' praised the madman who tried to murder my own child
' - The crowd is silent, stunned, as Bane continues to read
'The things we did in Harvey's name brought desperately needed security to our streets
But  can no longer live with my lie
It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth, and it is time for me to resign
' Bane folds the papers
Looks out to the stunned crowd
Do you accept this man's resignation
Individuals in the crows start shouting 'Yes
' ,   - Prisoners cheer, pounding against the bars
Selina watches
- Do you accept the resignation of all the liars
All the corrupt
More and more of the crowd is chanting 'Yes
' 110
'  - Blake turns to Gordon, who stares at the
These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act
Based on a lie
lie to keep a city from burning to the ground
Gotham needed a hero, someone to believe in - Not as much as it does now
But you betrayed everything you stood for
(looks at Blake) There's a point
Far out there
When the structures fail you
When the rules aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead
Maybe one day you'll have such a moment of crisis
And in that moment,  hope you have a friend like  did
To plunge their hands into the filth so you can keep yours clean
Your hands look pretty filthy to me, Commissioner
Gordon stares at him
Blake goes back to packing
- Bane signals a Tumbler - its turret turns to the prison doors
We take Gotham from the corrupt
The rich
The oppressors of generations who've kept you down with the myth of opportunity
And we give it to you, the people
Gotham is yours - none shall interfere
Do as you please
The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell
() 111
(') But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed
Step forward, those who would serve
Bane's men surge through the burning gates
- Selina watches as Prisoners stream out of open cell doors
She makes her way quietly through the excited throng
(
) For an army will be raised
Mercenaries hand out weapons to escaping Prisoners
- As Mercenaries shoot open locks, people storm into expensive apartment buildings overlooking the park
(
) The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests
- People ransack the apartment
(
) and cast into the cold world the rest of us have known and endured
- Wealthy people are herded onto the street by Mercenaries
(
) Courts will be convened
- kangaroo court is in session, presided over by a Criminal we recognize from Blackgate
Bane watches from the gallery
112
(
) The spoils will be enjoyed
,   - Tough-looking Revellers crack open champagne - spraying it, swigging it - Selina amongst them, watching
(
) Blood will be shed
- Hundreds of Police living underground
Dividing up supplies lowered by ropes
Ross opens a pack of supplies
(
) But the police will live, until they are ready to serve true justice
- Moving in on the bright glow of the core
(
) This great city will endure
Close enough to see the flickering digits of its countdown
(
) Gotham will survive
Mercenaries load the core into the back of a black truck
,   - Wayne rolls off his cot
Grunts
The Prisoner realizes Wayne is trying to do a push-up
From the next cell, the Blind Prisoner says something
He says you must first straighten your back
The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully
113
How would he know
He was the prison doctor morphine addict who incurred the displeasure of powerful people
Including your masked friend
How
Many years ago, during a time of plague, Bane was attacked by other prisoners
The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage left him in perpetual agony
The mask holds his pain at bay
Is Bane the child you spoke of
Was he born here
The legend is that there was a mercenary working for the local warlord who fell in love with his daughter
They married in secret
The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne's arms
When the warlord found out, he condemned the mercenary to this pit
But then exiled him instead
: the Mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren road
He starts to walk
The mercenary understood that the warlord's daughter had secured his release, but he couldn't know the true price of his freedom
She had taken his place in the pit
: a Woman is lowered into the prison
The prisoners below all have their faces covered with muslin masks
114
And she was with the child
The mercenary's child
: the Woman watches as the Doctor, (the Blind Prisoner, younger-looking, sighted) examines her small child
The Doctor exits, locking the cell
One day the doctor forgot the lock the cell
: Prisoners move into the cell towards his mother
The child runs at them with a knife
Innocence cannot flower underground
It was to be stamped out
But the child had a friend protector
: the Protector, face covered, pulls the Child off the attackers
One grabs for the Child - the Protector snaps his arm, carries the Child into a corner
who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption
The mother was not so lucky
The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner
He nods
This is Bane's prison now
Bane would not want this story told
The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled upright
The Prisoner ties him off
Checks his spine
You have a protruding vertebra
'm going to force it back
How -
The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard
Wayne screams
You stay like this
Until you stand
Wayne passes out from the pain and we
Wayne is hanging in his cell, delirious
115
'    (
) Did you not think 'd return, Bruce
's al Gh l, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne
' told you  was immortal
watched you die
' There are many forms of immortality
Wayne looks inward, remembering
:  's at the campfire (from Batman Begins)
' Once  had a wife
My great love
She was taken from me
: the Woman is lowered into the prison
Wayne looks at  's
You were the mercenary
Bane is your child
Your heir
: the Mercenary at the side of the road
's
' An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization
No
' You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years
With all your strength and resources, all your moral authority
And the only victory you could achieve was a lie
Finally you understand
Gotham is beyond saving
116
' And must be allowed to die
And we are - ,   - Snow blankets the street
Tumbler carves tracks as it patrols the deserted street
Blake peers from behind a parked car - he is crouched, feeding a kite string down a storm drain
- Ross strains to reach a note dangling on a string - he grasps it
All around him are dozens of Cops living underground
- Blake winds the string, picks up a jerrycan, hurries off
'    - The home is packed
People, not just kids, huddle in every corner
Blake spots Father Reilly
Hands him the can
For the bus in case there's a chance to evacuate
Keep it in here - people are siphoning parked cars
Really
() How do you think  got it
Right
Any news
Is the - Less you know, Father
How're the boys
117
Power's been on more, so they get some
Blake smiles
Moves to the door
Blake, you be careful out there
They're hunting down cops like dogs
Blake nods
Leaves
,   - Following Selina through rooms strewn with trash, empty bottles and sleeping partygoers
She spots a family photograph, glass smashed
hand lands on her shoulder
Who's that
This was someone's home
Now it's everyone's home
Selina stares out at a Tumbler rolling by
'Storm's coming', remember
This is what you wanted
No
It's what  thought  wanted
,   - The Prisoner unties the rope from Wayne's chest
Wayne stands
Just
Then walks
- Wayne does push-ups
Stronger
The Prisoner watches
Why build yourself
'm not meant to die in here
The Prisoner indicates the : 118
:  84
Here
There
What's the difference
Wayne ignores this
Focuses on his body
,   - Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed Prisoner, wraps it around his chest
Curious Prisoners gather, the Prisoner at their head
Wayne looks up at the light, hundreds of feet above
Starts to climb
Prisoners get excited as Wayne  - money starts exchanging hands
Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the next handhold, far away
He takes a breath, then
His fingers brush the ledge
Wayne  a hundred feet - the rope catches,  him into the rock face
The Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner lowers Wayne on the rope
The Blind Prisoner turns away
told you it could not be done
You told me a child did it
No ordinary child
: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child, older now, moves to the climbing wall child born in hell
: the Child makes the climb
pauses, looking down - making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off Prisoners
They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn
child forged by suffering, hardened by pain
: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a handhold on the ledge and swinging up
Not a man from privilege
Wayne's eyes close in despair
119
,   - Supply trucks await inspection
Mercenaries open an 18-wheeler - check boxes of rations
wave it on
- The 18-wheeler pulls up
line of Gothamites waits patiently along the sidewalk
18- - Three plain-clothes Special Forces Men emerge from the boxes, checking, then concealing weapons
The doors open - they exit
- The Special Forces Men carry boxes into the store as if delivering
The Store Manager leads them into the back and down into - - Where they are met by four Cops out of uniform
You have
1 Of course not
How can we trust you
(
) We don't have any choice
Gordon and Blake emerge from the back of the room
1 Commissioner Gordon
Captain Jones, Special Forces
Captain, glad to have you here
120
How many of you are there
Dozens
'd rather not say exactly
But the men trapped underground number almost three thousand
What kind of shape they're in
They've been getting water, food
Could we break them out
Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries guarding the outflow south of Ackerman Park, blow the rubble, you've got a hole big enough for ten at a time
'm in contact with my partner - they're waiting for the day
2 Men who haven't seen daylight for three months
Men with automatic weapons who haven't seen daylight in three months
What about the bomb
The satellites can't see any radiation hot spots
- Blake scouts with Jones
rumble makes them turn
(
) They keep it on a truck - it must have a lead-lined roof
They move it constantly
(
) But you know the truck
121
(
) They've got three of them
The routes don't vary much
Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street
Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger counter
Shows Blake the display
Nods
One of the Tumblers stops, turns back
Blake leads them down a side street
- What about the triggerman
No leads
It's a bluff - Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else
We can't take that chance
Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device, smuggle men over - While Gotham lives under a warlord, like in some failed state
Dial it back, officer
This situation is unprecedented
We can't do anything to risk millions of lives
( ) Aren't you gonna tell him
Captain, things are more complicated than you think
There's somebody you need to meet
Blake
Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs
,  - Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank
122
- They head across the empty lobby to an elevator
- Blake leads them into empty offices
Cots and makeshift furnishings line the offices and corridors
was up here looking for a vantage point
Found the people who run the corporation who owns it living here
Which corporation
(
) Wayne Enterprises
Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate
Captain, meet Mr
Fox
Mr
Fox, 'd like you to brief the Captain
Captain Jones indicates Miranda
Miss Tate is fully aware of the situation
And as  of Wayne Enterprises, have to take responsibility for it
Why
Because, Captain, we built it
You built the bomb
It was built as a fusion reactor
The first of its kind
Bane turned the core into a bomb, then disconnected it from the reactor
123
And here's the important part
As the device's fuel cells decay, it's becoming increasingly unstable
until the point of detonation
The bomb's a time bomb
And it will go off
In twenty-three days
Captain Jones reels at this news
Bane's revolution is a sham
He's watching Gotham rearrange its deckchairs while the whole ship's going down
Your appeasement plan might not be as practical as you thought
Captain Jones throws Blake a look
Addresses Fox
Could you disarm it
don't know, But  could reconnect it to the reactor
Stabilize it
We'd have to let the Pentagon know
2 They'll be monitoring our - We have no choice
Let's move away from this location, then call it in
124
- Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and Blake
Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose
Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes a devastating ambush
Blake dives back into the elevator
- Blake flies out of the elevator
Fox, somebody sold us out
Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor
Take Miranda - Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs
Mercenaries jump out of the elevator, firing high
Fox freezes
Lowers himself to the ground
- Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets
The other Special Forces Men are down
Bane enters, midges Jones with his toe
He is alive
Barely
Bane leans in close
Jones looks up at him, defiant
'll die before  talk
'm on your schedule, Captain
Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth
There were people living upstairs
Bane looks up, disinterested
Jones is dead
Give them over for judgement
(Indicates bodies
) Hang them where the world will see
125
,   - Wayne stares at the : the Special Forces bodies hang in the cables of Gotham Bridge
Wayne throws a stone into the screen
- Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches
The Blind Prisoner listens
He speaks in an ancient tongue
He says the leap to freedom is not about strength
My body makes the jump
( ) Survival is the spirit
The soul
My soul's as ready to escape as my body
Fear is why you fail
'm not afraid
'm angry
Wayne throws punches
focused
- Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb
Prisoners look up, but none bother to gather round
Wayne starts climbing, determined
He  the rock face
breathing hard
Grabs at a rock - it comes away in his hand
He  -  into the rock face
The Blind Prisoner shakes his head
Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up at Wayne, hanging upside down
Shouldn't you get him down
The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful
126
He'll keep
As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we - : Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well, looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him
(
) And why do we fall
- Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there
( ) You do not fear death
You think this makes you strong
This makes you weak
Why
How can you move faster then possible
Fight longer than possible
If not from the most powerful impulse of the spirit
The fear of death
The will to survive
Wayne gets up onto his elbow
Looks at the Blind Prisoner
do fear death
fear dying in here while my city burns with no one there to save it
Then make the climb
How
As the child did
Without the rope
(Dry laugh
) Then fear will find you again
Wayne considers this
127
- Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he folds into a makeshift shoulder pack
Supplies for your journey
Prisoners nearby laugh
Wayne moves to the cliff face
The Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor
The Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope
Wayne refuses
Starts to climb
Prisoners gather around as word spreads
Wayne makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face
Down below the Prisoners start a low chant
As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something from the cliff face
Wayne flinches -
They circle up to the opening above
Wayne closes his eyes
The chant
Wayne takes a breath
opens his eyes
looks down at the drop
up again
then he jumps
Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing
And Wayne  the ledge above
The Prisoners go  as Wayne hoists himself up onto the ledge
The Blind Prisoner nods
Wayne climbs to
,    - Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation
He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached to the wall
He pushes it into the hole then walks away
,    - mass of huddled Gothamites
Professionals (traders, industrialists)
In a corner, Fox
Mercenaries come down into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling
It is Stryver, Daggett's functionary
want to see Bane
There's been a mistake
Take me to Bane
Fox watches him dragged upstairs
128
- kangaroo court
Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd
There's been a mistake
Where's Bane
(
) There's been no mistake, Mr
Stryver
Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr
Jonathan Crane
You are Philip Stryver, executive vice-president of Daggett Industries
(Off nod from Stryver
) The same Philip Stryver who for years lived like a prince off the blood and sweat of people less powerful
Call Bane
'm one of you
Jeers
Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching
Bane
Bane has no authority here
This is merely a sentencing hearing
The choice is yours, death or exile
Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts 'Death'
Exile
( ) Sold
to the man in the cold sweat
Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock
- Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the ice
Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering
129
Follow the tick ice
Try to swim - you're dead in minutes
Has anyone made it
The Blackgate Inmate turns away
Stryver is forced onto the ice
He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking
Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him
- Gordon stands over a map of the city
handful of Cops sit around the room
Waiting
Gordon looks at his watch
Where the hell are they
It's not like we have a lot of time, here
How long
The bomb goes off tomorrow
We've got about eighteen hours to do something
To do what
We mark that truck
Get a  on it, then we can start thinking about how to take it down
The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops
Gordon is counting them in
He moves to Blake
() That's it
Blake just looks at him
Gordon checks the faces
Realizes
Foley
Where's Foley, dammit
Gordon heads for the door
130
You shouldn't be out on the streets '  - Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone
Stabs the bell
' Jim
He's not here - Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her
You're sending your wife to the door when the city's under occupation
Foley appears at the end of the corridor
Ashamed
Wait in the kitchen, honey
What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard
Jim, you saw what they did to those Special Forces
You forgotten all the years we went out on patrol with every gangbanger wanting to plant one as soon as our backs were turned
This is different and you know it
These guys run the city - the government's done a deal with them Deal
Bane's got their balls in a vice
That's not a deal - You move against Bane, the triggerman's gonna hit the button - 131
You think he's given control of that bomb to one of 'the people'
You think this is part of some revolution
There's one man with his finger on the button - Bane
We have to keep our heads down until they can fix this
If you still had family here maybe you'd - This only gets fixed from inside the city, Foley
(Calmer
) Look, 'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues
But we've got to do something before this maniac blows us all to hell
'm sorry Jim
gotta - Keep your head down
What's that gonna do tomorrow, when that thing blows
You don't know that's going to happen
Foley closes the door on Gordon
Gordon stands there
(
) hear you're looking for men, Commissioner
Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her
Blake shrugs
How about me, instead
Miss Tate,  can't ask you - My company built it
Bruce Wayne built it
132
And he wanted to destroy it
It was me who didn't listen
Please
Gordon looks at Blake
Then Miranda
Nods
Let's go
- Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two Gangbangers
The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him
You steal from us, you little bastard
They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an apple, moves to hit the Kid when -
- his hand is grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks
Selina catches the apple
You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely
Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him stab himself in the backside
The Gangbangers run off, howling
The Kid eyes her, wary
Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid
Now you're gonna take it
Selina looks at the red apple
Takes one perfect bite
Just tax
She tosses him the apple
He takes it and runs
(
) Pretty generous, for a thief
Selina recognizes the voice
Turns to find Wayne - strong, but weathered
Beard, work clothes
133
You came back
thought they'd killed you
Not yet
If you're expecting an apology - It wouldn't suit you
need your help
And why would  help you
Wayne pulls a  drive out of his pocket
For this
The 'Clean Slate'
You're gonna trust me with that
After what  did to you
admit  felt a little let down
But  still think there's more to you
In fact,  think for you - (indicates ) this isn't a tool, it's an escape route
You want to disappear
Start fresh
She looks at him
Takes the drive, staring at it
Start fresh
can't even get off this island
can give you a way off
Once you've gotten me to Lucius Fox need you to find out where they're holding him
Then take me in
Why do you need Fox
To save this city
134
Who says it needs saving
Maybe like it this way
Maybe you do
But tomorrow that bomb's going off
Get your powerful friend on the case
'm trying
But  need Fox
- Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams
Gordon is walking down the street with Miranda
He hands her a Geiger counter
Stay further up the block
(Points at Men
) They're gonna cross the street and try and slow the truck down
As it approaches, hit this button
If the needle hits two hundred - give me the signal and mark the truck
Okay
( ) Heads up
Blake is up on a rooftop
Gordon moves down to the other end of the block
As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the road
The convoy barely slows
Miranda gives Gordon the signal
As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic locator at the lower part of the truck
Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner
Checks his
Got it
They keep moving, turning down the next street
into an ambush
Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained
Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest
135
On whose authority
The people of Gotham
Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and the other Cops being rounded up and led away
,    - Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner
Thugs come down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner
They kick him down the last step and he stumbles
Fox moves to his aid
1 Find this one a spot, he's got a big day tomorrow
They dump the Hooded Man with Fox
2 We all do
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne
Fox hears this
Pulls the bag from Wayne's head
Wayne nods at him, silent
Fox nods back
The Thugs leave
Miranda comes over
Bruce
You picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr
Wayne
How long until the core ignites
That bomb goes off in twelve hours
Unless we can connect it to the reactor
If you can get it there
'll find a way to plug it back in
(Indicates Miranda
) Can you get Miranda out
136
Not tonight
'm sorry
Do what's necessary
( ) Tonight  need you
What for
To get me back in the game
Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs
Sorry to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys himself
The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks up
won't forget about you
know
,   - The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade
Catwoman spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to the throat
Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists
like your girlfriend, Mr
Wayne
He should be so lucky
And she's gone
Fox turns to Wayne
Who shrugs
- Lights flicker on
Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker
137
Any move  make against Bane or the bomb - the triggerman sets it off
They can't be using radio or cell - too much interference
Infrared doesn't have the range
It could only be micro-burst long wave
Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt
Could you block it
Yes
need the  cannon-guidance mount from the Bat
You remember where you parked
Wayne nods
Smiles
The Batsuit rises from the floor
-  ( ) Gordon and his men on trial
Crane presides
The charges are espionage and attempted sabotage
Do you have anything to say in your defense
No lawyer, no witnesses
What sort of due process is this
More than you give Harvey's prisoners, Commissioner
Your guilt is determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing
What's it to be, death or exile
Crane, if you think we are going willingly out onto that ice, you've got another think coming
Death, then
138
Looks that way
Very well
Death
(Smiles
) By exile
He smashes his gavel
Bane leans in to one of his men, indicates Miranda
Bring her to me
,  - Wayne bounds up the stairs
Fox follows, out of breath think it's time to talk about my year-end bonus
, ,  - Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat
As the sun sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount
She fly pretty well
Even without the autopilot
Autopilot
That's what you're there for
- Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice
Mercenary fires his gun in the air
Gordon takes a breath, then leads his men onto the ice
which creaks and groans
Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of liquid, beside it: a flare
Gordon picks it up, puzzled
(
) Light it up
139
Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare - jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of  across the ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a '  - ' Dad
Check it out
' Honey, take a look
Foley moves to a back window
Sees the flaming sign
- Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back
Sir
Bane turns
The Mercenary points at the sign
You think it's really him
Impossible
' ,  - Foley yanks up the floorboards
Pull his dress blues from their hiding place
,   - Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign
One of them moves out to get a better look
He is taken out by a dark figure
The figure steps into the light - it is Blake
- Batman hands Gordon a metal box
140
This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb
Get it onto the truck by sunrise
They might hit the button when it starts
When what starts
War
,   - Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open manhole
Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb out
- Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover
Blake is grabbed by Mercenaries
They detonate the manhole, sealing it, prepare to execute Blake
dark shape drops onto the Mercenaries
Blake watches, in awe, as Batman takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is finished
Quiet
One of the Mercenaries moves slightly
You missed a spot
Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake
If you're working alone, wear a mask
No one cares who  am
The mask is not for you
It's to protect the people you care about
Huh
And you always seem to know where those people are
How is that
lost someone once
Since then break into their homes when they're sleeping and implant a tracking device on the back of their neck
Blake laughs
Then feels the back of his neck
Batman tosses Blake a mini-mine
141
On three - one, two, three - They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance - the blasts barely move any rubble
No offense, but you got anything bigger in that belt
That's to warn the men on the other side
Batman disappears into the shadows
But how do we -
The Bat's cannons light up the night
Okay
Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but glad to be alive and carrying guns
What now
All-out assault on Bane
but you need to get the people you care about across the bridge
Why
In case we fail
Lead an exodus across the bridge
Save as many lives as you can
Don't you need me here
You've given me an army
Now go
Blake nods
Turns to leave
Stops
142
Thank you
Don't thank me yet
might not get a chance later
Batman nods
Blake disappears into the night
- Gordon checks the metal box
Puts it under his coat
Nods at his men, hiding in the doorways
Checks his
- Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container
He opens it, revealing the Bat-Pod
Catwoman's eyes light up
Oh, you shouldn't have
She hops on, feeling the controls
The mid-town tunnel's blocked by debris, but the cannons give you enough firepower to make a path for people
Catwoman marvels at the controls
To start it, you - got it
We've got forty-five minutes to save this city - No, 've got forty-five minutes to get clear of the blast radius, because you don't stand a chance against these guys
143
With your help  might
She shakes her head
'll open that tunnel, then 'm gone
He looks at her
There's more to you than that
She stares back at him
Facade slipping a touch
Sorry to keep letting you down
He says nothing
She looks at him, imploring
Come with me
Save yourself
You don't owe these people anymore - you've given them everything
Not everything
Not yet
Batman turns
Catwoman watches him go
Then fires up the bike and takes off
- Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod
She pulls up at the tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles
- The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street
At the op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall
Men pour out of the building, forming up into an opposing line
Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward
It is Foley
The silence is eerie
The numbers look evenly matched - until two Tumblers arrive
( ) The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined
144
There's only one police in this city
He steps forward
The line follows
- Bane stands in the colonnade
Watching
Open fire
,   - The Tumblers  into the line of Cops,  men into the air,
The line of Cops is about to scatter - The Bat  down in front of the Cops and both Tumblers,  them sideways
The Bat and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand
The street is filled with thousands of men in pitched battle
- Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel blockage
the dust settles
Her path is clear
- Gordon heard the fighting
Checks the box
Nervous
Come on, come on
- Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and right
space clears - he is face the face with the Batman
You came back
To die with your city
No
came back to stop you
145
Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head
Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side
Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda
- The black truck rounds the corner
Gordon signals his man in a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street
The truck smashes into the bus and stops
Gordon and his men swarm in, blasting at the Guards
Gordon opens the back - empty
No bomb
Wrong truck
That's impossible
Come on
Cut over to Fifth
They sprint for the next parallel avenue
- Fox hurries into the reactor - starts throwing switches
'    - Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the street
Knock on doors, spread the word - the bomb's going to blow
Get out by the South Street tunnel, or over the bridge
Do two blocks, then get back to the bus
The boys race down the street
Father Reilly climbs into the bus
- Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler roars between them, separating them
Batman chases after
146
,   - Bane  backwards through the door, Batman on him
Batman  Bane against the marble floor
Mercenaries guarding Miranda move towards them - Stay back
He is mine - Bane  Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but Batman  Bane to the ground,  sideways across the tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm
Bane bellows, thrashing in
Batman holds him down with a hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand
Give me the trigger
You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen - Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through pain-soaked eyes
gasping through his broken mask for relief
broke you
How have you come back
You thought you were the only one who could learn the strength to escape
Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain
never escaped -  's al Gh l rescued me
That is why  must fulfill his plan
That is why must avenge his murder
() The child of  's al Gh l made the - (
) But he is not the child of  's al Gh l
Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear
147
am
Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs
And though  am not 'ordinary', am a citizen
She pulls out the trigger
- Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street
His men pull in front, slowing it
Gordon jumps into the back
The truck accelerates - Gordon drops, hanging on to the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on
,   - Batman cannot move to defend himself
He has Bane by the throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side - / My mother named me Talia before she was killed
The way  would've been killed if not for my protector
Bane
: the child, Talia, makes eye-contact with the Protector, then leaps
Down below, Prisoners swarm over the protector, ripping the muslin from his face
Bane looks up at Talia, says one quiet word - Goodbye
Then is overrun
climbed out of the pit
: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at the landscape
found my father and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance - but by that time
the prisoners and the doctor had done their work to my friend
my protector
Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask
148
: the League of Shadows descend into the prison - at their head,  's al Gh l
They slaughter prisoners
Then stop
's al Gh l has found Bane, bandaged
The League took us in
Trained us
,    - Bane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows from men with sticks
(
) But my father could not accept Bane
's al Gh l watches Bane training
Turns away
,   - Talia looks into Bane's eyes as she holds the knife in Batman's side
He saw only a monster who could never be tamed
Whose very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in
He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows
His only crime was that he loved me
could not truly forgive my father
Talia looks at Batman, cold
Until you murdered him
He was trying to kill millions of innocent people - 'Innocent' is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce
honor my father by finishing his work
Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience
Talia twists the knife in Batman's side
You see, it's the slow knife
the knife that takes its time, the () 149
(') knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between bones
that's the knife - Talia arms the trigger
- that cuts deepest
She hits the button - nothing
- light on the metal box is blinking
Gordon hangs on - ,   - Talia turns, furious
Your knife may have been too slow
Mercenary steps forward - The truck's under attack - Talia looks around, mind racing
Gordon
(To Batman
) You gave him a way to block my signal
No matter - (Looks at watch
) He's bought Gotham eleven minutes
(Shouts at Mercenary
) Prepare a convoy
We must secure the bomb until it detonates
Talia jumps to her feet
Bane grabs a shotgun from a Mercenary - points it at Batman
Not yet
want him to feel the heat
(To Batman
) Feel the fire of twelve million souls you failed
Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes, tenderly
Goodbye, my friend
Bane nods at her, slowly
Talia moves out with the Mercenaries
150
- Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary
Three Tumblers pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars, cops
Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm
Talia's Tumbler  him out of the way
,   - Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the rounds in the barrels
You'll have to imagine the fire - He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman's face
We both know  need to kill you now
He squeezes the trigger
Bane is blasted across the lobby by cannon fire
Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod
The whole no-guns thing
don't feel as strongly about it as you do
- Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off, marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear Uniform shouts through the loudhailer - Stay there
What are you doing
( ) Blake,  - 'm getting these boys to safety - Safety
You're gonna get us all killed
Anyone crosses this bridge they blow the city - 151
It's gonna blow anyway
We need this bridge open right now
No one leaves the island
Orders - Whose orders
Bane's
Police Department's
Haven't you heard the shooting
The Batman's battling it out with Bane The Batman's dead
Look, Officer - It's Detective - Well, Detective, you take one more step, we have to shoot you
Two more steps, we have to blow the bridge
(to the boys) Wait for me back at the bus
The Boys walk back down the bridge
- Talia's convoy surrounds the black truck
Tumblers off each flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down
,   - Batman looks at Catwoman
need you on the ground, me in the air, we have to force that convoy east, to the entrance to the - 152
- Catwoman roars down the steps on the Bat-Pod
- Gordon climbs into the back of the truck - the bomb is there, heating up
He looks at the countdown - nine minutes
- Blake turns back to the Uniform
Your orders are out of date
The situation's changed
Listen, 'm a cop like you
And 'm walking out there
Please don't shoot me
Blake walks
Shots ring out at his feet
He keeps walking
- The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the ground
rolling battle ensues
Catwoman targets the rear of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the junctions, trying to force the convoy east
The Tumbler's gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman
She swerves to avoid heavy fire
- Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots
Son-of-a-bitch
(To his partner
) Blow it
Before he reaches the line His partner arms the detonator
Uniform shouts at Blake - Get down
We're blowing the bridge
As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him blasts upwards in a massive fireball
Blake dives backwards
153
- The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the air
Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to take out another Tumbler
The countdown ticks away
seven minutes
- As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye - something is wrong
- The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap
You idiots
You sons of bitches
You're killing us
- Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers
He dives back inside, moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead, gauging the driver's position
Starts firing blind through the bulkhead - ,   - Bullets fly through the cab
The driver takes one, falls forward, dead
Talia takes the wheel - bullets keep coming
- Blake races back
Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle, - Father
Get the boys on the bus - But there's nowhere to go, son
154
- The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it into a hard right turn
- Talia watches the navigation screen
( ) They're trying to force us onto - Pushing us to the entrance of the reactor
They're going to try and reconnect the core
( ) Can they
Talia smiles
- Fox runs to a ladder
Alarms sound
As he hits the ladder he turns
massive rumble builds - water  into the reactor, flooding in from both directions
- Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler
She blasts it again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side
Both vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel
- Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as a wave smashes into him, painfully
155
- Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to expose the glowing core
Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod
Give me a hand
The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth
Gordon moves in to try and grab the core but it is too hot
Let's get a cable on it and drag it out
Come on, we're almost there - Laughter
Gordon turns
Talia, lying half out the truck
Dying
Fox showed me how to operate the reactor core
Including the emergency flood - - Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater - - Gordon looks down at Talia
Batman is at his side
There is no way to stop this bomb
Prepare yourselves
(Looks up at Batman
) My father's work is done
Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed
Gordon turns - Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to attach a hoist from the Bat
What're you doing
Two minutes
can fly it out over the bay
Catwoman is at his side as he works
Rig it out to fly over the water, then bail - 156
No autopilot
She takes this in
He stands to face her
You could've gone anywhere
Been anything
But you came back here
So did you
guess we're both suckers
She puts her arms around his neck
Kisses him
Batman moves to the Bat, Gordon alongside
So this is the part where you vanish, only this time you don't come back
Batman opens the canopy
- Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus
Come on
On the bus
What're you doing
Protection from the blast - It's an atom bomb -
Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious
You think they need to hear that in their last seconds
You think 'm going to let them die without hope
157
- Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm
never cared who you were - And you were right
But shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them
hero can be anyone
That was always the point
Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon
Anyone
man doing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a little boy's shoulders to let him know that the world hadn't ended
The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers : Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring, loving
Gordon looks up to the cockpit - Bruce Wayne
- but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat
Gordon out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the tunnel mouth
The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but there's no power to get over it
- Blake shouts into the bus - Heads down
Heads down, now
158
Blake, they need to make their peace
Blake turns to him, furious
They're children
They have no peace to make - An  from downtown Gotham
Blake looks across, startled, turns to the children on the bus
Get down
This is it
The smallest of the boys stares through the window past Blake
No
That's Batman
Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it
It curves dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth of the river
the bay
the ocean
Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear - wind and light and dust blowing  but harmlessly over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham
As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and boats converge on the island, we hear a voice
Jim Gordon
(
) ' see a beautiful city and a brilliant people rising from this abyss
' Blake pulls out his badge
Throws it into the river
(
) ' see the lives for which  lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy
' ,   - Gordon is reading from  Tale of Two Cities
Opposite is Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim
Another figure is there, whose face we do not yet see
159
' see that  hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence
It is a far, far better thing that  do, than  have ever done
' Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave
'It is a far, far better rest that go to than  have ever known
' Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him
Alfred
Tears streaming
Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves
Gordon and Blake follow
Alfred, alone with the Wayne family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of Thomas and Martha Wayne
'm so sorry
failed you
You trusted me, and  failed you
And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs
,   - Gordon nods at Lucius
Blake is at Gordon's side
Can  change your mind about quitting the force
No
What you said about structures
About shackles
can't take it
The injustice
(Gestures at gardens
)  mean
no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city
They know
(Off look
) It was Batman
160
,   - Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue being unveiled
The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in granite
We move in on the stone face
(
) Mr
Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate
'  - The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small group
Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of
The contents of the house are to be - He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake
- Movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the house, watched by a solitary figure
Alfred
(
) - to settle the estate's accounts
The remainder is left in its entirety to Alfred
Pennyworth
'  - Blake shifts
Out of place
The Lawyer continues
The house and grounds are left to the city of Gotham, on condition that they never be demolished, altered, or otherwise interfered - 161
- Different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house
(
) And that they shall be used for one purpose, and one purpose only
schoolbus pulls up
Father Reilly shepherds children towards the house
The children look up at the house, wide-eyed
The housing and care of the city's at-risk and orphaned children
sign reads: '  - People file out as the Lawyer stands
My clerk will help anyone with the smaller correspondences and instructions
Blake approaches the Clerk
She smiles
Blake, John
( ) Nothing here
Blake realizes, offers her his driving license
Try my legal name
The Clerk glances at the license
Checks
Yup, here it is
She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various items, and hands him a sports bag
Blake takes it, curious
You should use your full name like that name
Robin
162
Blake smiles, embarrassed
Leaves
Any word on the missing item
No, not yet
Well, they'd better leave no stone unturned
We can't just put a string of pearls on the manifest as 'lost'
- Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor
Two Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit
1 Why worry about the stabilization software
This whole autopilot system's obsolete - Please,  just need to know what could've done to fix it
2 But Mr
Fox, it's already been fixed
(Typed on panel
) Software patch
six months ago
() Check the user ident on the patch
Tech 2 types some more keys
Looks surprised
2 Huh
Bruce Wayne
Fox turns away from the rotor, an idea starting to form
- Blake sits in his car looking at a  device, puzzled
Beside him, the sports bag, open
In it is a piece of paper with coordinates, on top of some climbing rope and shackles
Blake gets out of the car with the bag
Follows the  into the trees
163
,  - Alfred, paper under his arm, heads to his usual table
Sits
Lei e solo
Si, Fernet Branca, per cortesia
- Blake finds a large waterfall
He checks his , confused
Stares at the waterfall
Reaches for the climbing gear
- Gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest reports
,  - As Alfred sips his drink, he glances up at a couple at the next table
Strangers
Alfred looks back down
- Moving in on the waterfall from inside
Blake bursts through, landing painfully on the shale inside
he gets to his feet, moving cautiously into the cave
- Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening them
He stops
Sees something
The searchlight
fixed
Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat symbol
He looks up into the night
- Blake lights his torch
then ducks, crouching, as of  creatures descend
164
,  - Alfred folds his paper
Pulls out his money, then stops, seeing
across the tables, a familiar couple
Bruce smiles at Alfred, who nods
Bruce turns back to the pretty brunette in pearls
Selina
Alfred pays his bill, content
- Blake lifts his head,  the bats all around him
