bus pulls in on Beverly
McCAULEY and a nurse get off
Neil carries a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough
At 42 his short black hair is graying
He spent eight years in McNeil and three in San Quentin
He got out and hit the street in 1987
Four of the McNeil years were spent in the hole
Neil's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer's
He's very careful and very good
Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine too
And if you get in their way, that's got to be your problem
His lifestyle is obsessively functional
There's no steady woman or any encumbrance
Neil McCauley keeps it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds flat
Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white intern's coat from his paper bag
: -  -    - We  on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded corridor
Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by
broadcasts occasional messages
Nail crosses under an "" sign and keeps going towards the exit doors
- Neil
From the other direction two ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and pass by Neil
: Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off
Maybe he's stolen it
We don't know

Chris wears a hard hat over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb
, red, Milwaukee Tool Company case
He looks like a construction worker by day who by night hits
's slams, jams and raves
He's 29, from Austin, Texas
Chris is also a highline pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill
He and McCauley were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to 1987
Chris hit the streets in 1988
He's a hot dog and spends money as fast as he makes it
Right now, he and the Clerk exit to the sales counter
: - As they approach, the Clerk goes behind it
What you working on
Drillin' some post holes into concrete
(re: toolcase) With that you can ream solid steel
Check, charge, or cash

He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man
Sicilian from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and Marion penitentiaries
He's strictly a "cowboy": his natural inclination towards a score is "
get the guns and let's go
" He's been off smack and everything else for five years
He's clean and sober
He's the nicest guy on the block and a loving father
If you get in his way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you
If you asked him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you were talking about
It's 3 x 6 and two feet high
Miniature room sets are inside
Cerrito's thick fingers close the door
He picks it up
He crosses to a counter and - Wrap this here up
Yessir
You're going to have a happy little girl
Two

That's nice
Yeah
And gimme those three masks there
Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks

(ready) What
That chick on the ninth floor got naked and she's pressing herself against the glass again
(crosses to window) Let me see
Painter One looks through the scope
He looks down at the ninth floor and laughs
Then he looks away and sees something else: ' : Waingro goes to a drawer, pulls out a gun and starts towards the door

(beat) Probably not
(beat) but  am reminded of how much love you
But that may not be enough
(kisses him) You have to go to work, don't you
(touches her face) Yeah
As he's rising
Be careful, Vincent
Be very careful
(beat) Let's keep on trying
walking backwards, facing her, nods "yes
" The last thing in the world he wants to do is leave
Then he turns and starts running down the white marble corridor
: 14TH   -  - in the hotel security uniform approaches against the flow of people leaving the floor
The emergency  is on and the  fire alarm message still
Neil taps his flashlight on the doors of 1404, 1405 and 1406 as well as 1403

Sir, 'm afraid you'll have to
: 1403 -  - looks through the peep hole
' : ' few patrons exit past the uniformed Neil
It looks legitimate
: 14TH   -   1403 opens silently, half-way
looks inside
Waingro's obviously hidden behind the door Neil kicks the door and
1403 - smashes into Waingro
Neil hits the door again and it smashes into waingro a second time
reaches around, grabs Waingro by the arm, dislocates his shoulder, breaks his collarbone and throws him across the room
Waingro's gun goes flying
on the sofa, seeing Neil McCauley
He feels his internal organs drop through the floor
He looks away

+ should have dumped you in that parking lot
Look at me, you sick fuck
Waingro won't look at Neil
(continuing) Gimme your eyes
'Cause you're gonna die
Waingro, pathetically, obeys and looks up
Neil's
45 : now looks out the window, searching
' :      + "" staring at Neil through the Nite vision scope, disbelieving
Neil sees "Painter" One is shouting into his police radio
1403 - ' surprised not at all
He expected the police
He turns away from the window, looks once at Waingro and leaves the room
: -  - twisted in her seat, trying to see, frightened by the noise and sirens
An
fire engine  in
Now an unmarked car skids into the driveway
Drucker, Bosko and others spill out carrying shotguns
black and white parks perpendicular to the traffic flow and halts cars
She's worried, confused
: 1403 -  - dead iN sitting position on the sofa with his head back as if he fell asleep watching the football game

For some reason Hanna's disinterested
He's moving down a different track
He's cruising the streets looking for something else

trying to see through, past, around everything
We don't know what it is he's looking ' :  , , , Then Hanna's
back to the Mercedes
The woman waiting in the passenger seat
It is Eady
She's a block down
woman waiting
in a car
alone
: It's what he was looking for
- Hanna is out of the car in the jammed street, running towards Eady and the Mercedes a block away
,   - emerges and
In the foreground is Eady in the Mercedes
: calm, assured, approaches the car for the short drive to the airport
Then, Neil senses and
: turns and looks over his left shoulder
' : a half block away, running through vehicles and incoming on-lookers right at him
stops
He turns to Eady
looks at him, quizzically
running towards Neil and Eady
climbing out of the Mercedes, now, confused

starting to leave, moving at an oblique angle
Looking at her
leaving her
next to the Mercedes
Shouting at Neil
We can't hear what she says
and  of an ambulance
pulls in front of him, blocks him
He's around it, pushing a news crew out of the way, stops
in the street
Alone
No Neil
spins around, searching
+ : in the sea of people and vehicles, crossing drivewaYs and landscaping
Hanna - against the tide - moving away from the crime scene and police barricades to neighboring buildings
: through the crowd, searching
People pushed aside so he can see
Then
: figure is running between cars
Beyond are the lights of an L1011 ten feet off the ground about to touch down
: - L1011 - through the frame
Reveal Neil jumping a     fence and running across the grass between power units    and the racks of lights strobing their arrow sequence at    the head of the runway
Beyond is Sepulveda Boulevard and     normal traffic

It wipes out the strobe racks in a chaotic blast of xenon

The    of a 757's 95,000 lbs

He spins   to protect his face
His clothes and hair are whipped
As he runs to us

His
45 is up, centered into Hanna's face
He's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of strobes

The new round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery
perfectly controlled, hammered-on
His front sight barely moved
in the chest - is blown back into the racks of lights
He lies still
approaches, slowly
His gun hand drops to his side
:  + Neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack
One arm is in   his lap
The other is flung over the top bar of the strobe   rack
Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his hand
Hanna takes it
Neil holds on tight
last breath
not half bad
pretty good your own self
Then Neil's eyes dim
And he dies
:  + Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder
Hanna still grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at the lines of blue runway lights like rivers
The two of them stay there like that
