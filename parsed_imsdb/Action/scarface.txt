In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States
Within seventy- two hours, 3,000
boats were headed for Cuba
In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population
3y the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida
An estimated 25,000 had criminal records
This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos
' The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a stilleto and in the empty black void we: Opening Montage - Documentary    Footage: 2                                                     2 from the harbor in Mariel, Cuba

We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and then
We move to the eyes, pure in their fury
Finally we encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode -- muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from prison

Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in                                  a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of                                  the three

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery, standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with handling
Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone rings in a distant place

Pause
The faces of those in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive
Then recognizes somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over
Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a worn phone book in his hand

Everthing seems okay
So what do we do, walk in and start over

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom
What fuckin' difference does it make where 'm from
like to get to know who  do business with
It's like he's stalling for time
The Lizard has made a move somewhere off-center andis now sitting on the bed, coiled and always watching
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector
Hey 'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't
Okay, what's the stall here
Your guy late or something

Get up
Now shithead
She's standing there with a
32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel
There's no mistaking her ability to Shoot
The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony
Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more Columbians, "The Kids"
They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang
As Toad strips the handgun from Tony: Frog face, you just fucked up
You steal from me, you're dead
Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am  gonna kill your brother first
'Fore  kill you
Try sticking your head up your ass
See if it fits
Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto taped to the small of Tony's back
As he mutters something in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed
Toad begin6 assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set
The news, not 50 ironically in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide

Toad slaps a tape over his mouth
Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the bathroom

Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady

Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who nods and turns             on the whirring machine
The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly towards Angel

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too

'   - and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol
She crashes backwards into the room, wounded
Everything happens very fast now
Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck
Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across   the bathroom
The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny
Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards
Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side
The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram
In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half- second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol
He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room

As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken
Their      eyes       follow
As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all that counts
He stands behind the Toad
(Spanish) Your'turn,   cabron
The     Toad   whips         around     to    the     voice, eyes          stark       with        terror
Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart
The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity
Then an old lady faints
The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi- fication

The crowd, a combination of                  Caucasian and Latin, is mostly young, rich and happy and a                  lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses,                   trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they                  dance to a black American "Partying Down Tonight"

Him and his brother Miguel they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson

That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar  Gomez
Bad news
Stone killer there ever was one
Stay away
Their point of view -- Gaspar             Gomez at a table with another guy and gorgeous woman
the     fat guy,    with the chicas is Nacho      Contreras   -- El Gordo
Wouldn't know     it to look     at him but he's got more     cash than     anybody in here real      haza
Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas
you    know what a haza is, Tony
'Haza'
No   Frank, what's     a    haza
It's Yiddish for pig
It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know
That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for
If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it
See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it
Lesson number one -- don't under- estimate the other guy's greed
Lesson number two -- don't            get    high on your own supply

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an exquisite peral   necklace
She stares at it, doesn't take it
Gina comes over, takes it for her

On his wrist is a flashy gold  bracelet with "Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000
His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the look of death in an unsmiling face
He is always in proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who might glance at him
He is a continual source of tension underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar who is insecure to begin with

Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to look at a sample of the dried coke
The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him
Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then samples the coke off his thumb into his nose
Pause
His expression says  like it
He moves on
The Shadow moves with him
(meanwhile) Basically what 'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like-
-say 150 kilos a month
That's a big commitment Mr
Sosa
It's too bad Frank's not here
Something like that you should talk to him

But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic) So    he   sent you
Yeah, something like that
You sure got good stuff in there Mr
Sosa -- class  shit
Looking over the laboratory like it was his
Omar glances at him, annoyed
We'll talk at my house

At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony
The Shadow sits impas- sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony
Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con- stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene)
(to Omar) say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here,  could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo
You cannot do better than that

Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians
You know what that means
That means we gotta go to war with `em

When we cut out
the Coluxnbians we take risks -- on both sides

Forget it
Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal
What do you suggest is a fair
Excuse me
Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly appears at the door, apparently with a message
Sosa waves him in
The black aide - The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair on a huge and impressive skull
He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual
As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling #00766                        70 - 2 94                                                                  94 briefly on Omar who doesn't connect
The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression
Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information
beat
He whispers a second thought
Sosa reacts minimally
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex
(meanwhilzz Tony in a whisper) Shaddup willya Montana, 'm doing the talking here
Tony shrugs
Where were we
Panama
You're looking for a partner, right
Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony
something like that
(chuckles) Look Mr
Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here
'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit
got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that
So why don't we
Hey Omar why don't you let the man finish, hunh
Let him propose his proposition
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay
started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck

Don't worry about it
That's up to Frank -- not you
71 #00766 94 -       3 94 - He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing --        also an advantage in the split

It's all right
Maybe your partner's right
Maybe you should talk to Frank

Omar is taken aback by                   the OMAFi Yeah  guess so
Great

While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run business

The Skull waits inside with -~        the Shadow
They both stare at: Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside
The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the polo players exercising in the distance
a woman on a horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa
Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up
Why
'Cause the islands in the Caribbean, the governments in Russia, the Armys in Angola, and the people live in Miami
Sosa laughs
They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them

With a cigar and a big mouth

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the heli- copter rising off the lawn
(focusing the binoculars) like you Tony
There's no lying in you
Unfortunately  don't feel the same way about the rest of your organization

Don't blame him for that animal
It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know

Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him, makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony followng the pantomine, puts his out
Sosa now grips them

Everyday above ground's a good day
He winks and         goes
Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back        to the dance floor

Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy, the Owner, and Elvira drifts in
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her
She    sees    him   coming, glances           in   Frank's   direction
Tony   comes    right   up   to     her
Hi
Hello,   Tony
Lopez, in       conversation      with the Owner, glances               over, sees Tony with       Elvira, his       expression narrows

Lopez     comes Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl
That's     what     'm      doing,     Frank
Tense     look    on      Frank's     face
The   bodyguard      circles
(without a smile) Then go do it somewhere else
Get lost

Manny      suddenly       slides      into     frame,      backing     Tony

There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron    -- balls

The Emilio Rebenga hit
Remember that
You're    kidding
Who else knew about it
Omar's fertilizer, ain't he
Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me
don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony
Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York
You go
like the weather here just fine
He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the stairs to the toilets
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts after her

There are four legs visible in one of the stalls
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against the door
It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with burgundy suit running his ha&s along her ass
(shocked) Tony
What are you doing
What are you doing
He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several times into the wall
(trying to him) restrain Tony
What're you doing
You're crazy
He   rips   the     coke out      of    her      hands   and   scatters   it   across the tiles

91 #00766 109 - 2 109 Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air
The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of the hallway

Tow, raging, smacks her            the face
She reels back across into the toilet
Tony stands there, abated
The crowd is silent
Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing
(tender) Come on, baby, it's okay
-it's okay, he didn't mean it
(strokes her face) (disturbed, to Manny) Get her home, get her outta here
He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd, no regrets, but disturbed
Manny helps Gina to her feet

She's still angry
He's got a nerve the way he acts
Mama's right
She says he hurts every- thing he touches
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore
He`ll never see me again
Never
He loves you, what do you want
He feels he raised you
He still thinks 'm fifteen
He's been in jail five years and he still thinks 'm fifteen
Hey,    you're the best thing he's got
The    only thing
He don't want you to grow    up to be like him
So he's got this    father thing for you, protect you
Against      what

12/16/82 112 112 She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek
The ladykiller is rigid in his terror
She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him
He watches
113
-                              113 The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting    to Sinatra's "Strangers In The Night'
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh
() Now  want you to check out this next hombre
found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him
present with great pride, 'from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia'
Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot- light drawing immediate laughter
He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy
Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo
%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome face of a young clown in white paint with the large blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing audience
Tony is hooked by the image, looks on
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him, bouncing around like yo-yos
Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry
95 #00766 113 113 -
except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to its close, a haunting figure of mockery
Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time
His antennae warn him
Out of the side of his eye, he sees
The two hitters moving on him
He sprawls
Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery, smashing the mirrors
Screams,    crowd diving for cover
Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of his ankle, firing
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings
Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more mirrors, and more screaming
Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass
The clown, Octavia,    lies dead on the silent dance floor
114
-                                     114 Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar
Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out
The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club, towards him
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering
Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire
Carhops    scattering, the hitters seeking cover
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon
#00766                          96 114                                                                    114 Tony now pops a button
Bulletproof blackout shutters whap across the shattered windows
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off the armor plating, whining against the shutters
Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the gear shift into reverse
In an instant, his warmobile                        in reverse, accelerates climbing to top speed
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car

Tony looks at it, doesn't express a reaction
It's going to be sore for a few months
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer

There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones, moving, talking
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes
The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes
He drinks coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who look the part
It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of amounts
the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored

Manny    remembers
No     free    rides   in this        world,       kid

What     guy
(to Manny) You stay out of it
Run things down here

He   takes   a     hit,    unnoticed
(unheard) What     guy
(to Tony) don't like it
You don't like it
It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum
What's        Seidelbaum     got     to    do     with    this
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira
He surveys the table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to Elvira's untouched plate
Why don't you eat your                    food,     what's wrong with it

He passes a silent burp
(trying to shift the mood) So what about the trial

Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues                         to     look    at     Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant
(ignoring the question) Is this it
Is that what it's all about, Manny
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking
Then what
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here
Is that what it's all about
It's    not       so    bad    Tony,     could    be      worse

With these hands
Is that what  killed for

And thought  was a winner
Fuck it man,  can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, can't even have a fucking little baby
Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill
She gets up and dumps her plate filled with food on him
Slop drips all over him
You     sonufabitch
You fuck
They got a black tie audience now
The waiter tipping around to clean up the mess
Tony slowly wiping the food off   himself
How dare you talk to me like that
You call yourself a man
What makes you so much better than me, what do you do
Deal drugs
Kill people
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history
You want a kid
What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony
What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night
You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony
You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony
You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming
The       audience    is hushed, involved, the camera moving over the      faces of     Vie and his rich friends
Tony     acidly      quiet, looks     around   at   the   people,   back   to   her
Sit    down   before    kill    you

You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony
But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons around all the time
have Nick the Pig as a friend
What kind of life is that Tony
What kind of life is that

Tony's fury has passed
So has Elvira's
There's this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot their lines

She starts wobbling out
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony

With subtly inexorable music, the camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered, taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester

monsoon-like         wind     blows     through       the      trees     on     the    estate
The     monkeys      listen        quietly
The     f    lamingoes       flutter
Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go
see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace and we doors and          stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate
On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the balustrade
He's done so much coke now he's practically catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself
(insensate) Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you let 'em try  bury the cocksuckers
His point of view -- panning his estate
The dark emptiness The wind rustling the treetops
Tony echoes back at him
shaking his head at himself, He starts to cry

now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see: The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       ( view, checks the gate, turns
Suddenly two figures spring out at him
One of them garrotting the Marielito
He struggles
Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into the interior of the guard shack
They knife the other Marielito third   monitor
carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving through the trees on the estate
On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost incoherent
said to you, Manny,  said never go crazy and you said,  would you sonofabitch and you was right
those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh --   the   fucking      best
As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade
shadow starts climbing up as: we still are Manny, we still are -- see, 'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, 'm gonna run the market, 'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy you buy from me -- Tony Montana

Tony     sees   her
She steps         forward, offering her body almost naked to her brother
Is     this    what       you want      Tony
Tony     shocked
You can't stand another man                         touching me
So you want me Tony, is                        that it
Well here  am 0- She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand
The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk
She fires again
Again
'm all        yours       Tony,       'm all yours now
Bullets ripping into the desk
She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals
Come and get me Tony
Before       it's too     late
He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put distance between them
She sees him scurrying,
turns, an expression like a demented angel
Come on Tony, fuck           me
Fuck       me
Fuck me
Advancing on him, firing
The furniture tearing up, the chair spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling over to the terrace windows
Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him: - #02154                                  165 e v

He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina
Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor
Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade
The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds at the base of the balcony
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below
Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots                  ( yells    up     --- Tony, ( Get outta Tony,         they're    everywhere
here
Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    ( silencer bullets
We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull, moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly underneath the balcony on which Tony stands
Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse
It takes him by surprise
He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face
(gently) Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at me
didn't mean to kill Manny, was
was
Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids
Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers

You're all dirty now, you need a bath
Mami's gonna be angry baby -- ooh is she gonna be mad at me
Come on open your eyes my baby, open your eyes
-give me a smile
There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (: of the office
Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door pounding it
- Boss
Hey boss
Open up
On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire down into the foyer
Return fire decimates him
grenade goes off, blows him up against the door
Cheeee
He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder
He looks up at the monitor
On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out
Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch, talking to himself
So you wanna play hunh, say hello                    ( to my little friend here
Karroooomph
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian It sounds like punks off the landing into the foyer
Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly
Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling

Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing away
Laughing like a madman
You need an army you hear
An army to kill me
Behind him we see the remainder of the     pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind, whipping around    the office in auras of white
It is a ghostly effect out     of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the     terrace towards    _ Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun
Ha ha ha ha ha
You whores, you scum,  piss in your faces
Ha ha ha ha ha
Skull, now inches from Tony's back,     pulls   the   trigger The and blows Tony's spine out his belly
Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior swimming pool below
He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters
As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety
The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters
It says: "   " And so, for the brief moment, it was
