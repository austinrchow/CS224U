: small planet glows in the light of its sun
Suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind the planet
Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it
: ' Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic
It looks like Pompeii must have looked as Vesuvius erupted
- The creature is
We will meet him later on in a very different context, but for now, he is running from the ever- growing mist that threatens to engulf him
- As Kranix runs, another creature, , calls to him
Transform and flee, Kranix
You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron
Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid
Arblus
No
The mist threatens to engulf him too
He transforms into a small rocket ship and
He takes off
As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere, we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious Unicron
The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out
The energy cloud surrounds it and
Dissolves everything
And when the smoke clears, we get our first look at Unicron
It is horrifying
massive, metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity
() 2
: to  that this hideous planet is on a direct collision course with
There are    orbiting the huge planet Cybertron
But we are most concerned with a small, greenish metal one
It is the year 2005
The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron
But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland
At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious
Then, pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge cache of futuristic weapons
This is the Autobot staging ground for an assault on Cybertron until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on Cybertron
He peers into a monitor
As he speaks, we see the monitor to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned on Cybertron
Every time  look into this thing, my circuits sizzle
'm tired of this waiting game, Prime
When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops
He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion plans for Cybertron
We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide
Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth
'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with

He solemnly hands down an order Alright, ready the shuttle for launch
He raises a fist in a warwhoop
(looking into monitor) Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps
"" Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility
(
) Jazz,    report security status
- No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime
What about Moon Base 2
Jazz to Moon Base 2
and through the sky to - This is the second moon
It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one
This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed
(
) Jazz to Moon Base 2
They stand together a communication console
Spike is now 35 years old
Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail:  (heart) Cybertron
(club) Decepticons
() 4
: Bumblebee and Spike here
(
) We're about to send up the bird
Any Decepticon shenanigans in your sector
All clear, Jazz
(pause) Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, miss   him, and tell him 'll be coming home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail   across the galaxy
: Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of pre-launch tests
Will do, Spike

"" Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain
One
Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or something blows away revealing -- The shuttle
(
) (') Liftoff
Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of fire
() 5
: As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed to fight a war and an army to boot
The screen is bathed in smoke and fire which slowly clears
As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance
Now, all we need is a little Energon and a lot of luck
We see a bank of computers
Suddenly, a small tape deck pops open
a cassette pops out and transforms into
Laserbeak who flies away unseen
: - The shuttle    hurtles though a massive asteroid field
(
) Slow down, Ironhide
We want to get to Autobot city in one piece
: Ironhide is at the controls
If  can dodge Dececpticon rays,  can sure as shootin' dodge a couple of asteroids
Suddenly, there is a terrible
on the side of the ship, and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats
You were saying
() That wasn't an asteroid
There is a blast of light and they turn to see
6
The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a gaping hole in the side of the ship
Then, when the light clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see - In all his glory
Die Autobots
Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into ' arms and Starscream fires
is cut in half by Megatron's blast
as
eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for
an  of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter, firing
While  back are
then blasted apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments
As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons flood past them, taking positions and searching for other living Autobots
This was almost too easy, Starscream
Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base
You're an idiot, Starscream
Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one
() () 7
: (') But when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the Autobots will be vanquished forever
Fat chance, Megatron
Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings him against the wall
Such heroic nonsense
: -  - child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a across a star map towards a pulsing dot which represents the Earth
(
) The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint zeta
Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass
to show he is at an old fashioned "fishin' hole" on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating lazily out on the water
Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod
As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature
an "adolescent" Autobot
He is in robot mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all
(') Talk about dull
() 8
: Then, he tosses the rod into the water
(calling excitedly) Hurry or we'll miss it
lopes up hill after Daniel
(') If you're gonna ride, Dan-
ride in style
Hot Rod catches up with Daniel, scoops him off his hoverboard, to automotive mode and with Daniel in the front seat
- Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill
As they travel, we also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about
( : Autobot City looks like a federal energy project gone mad
Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy
The mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts
Near all of these various things are energon compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes of these scenes, we should see various panel truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot City
In short, it should be clear that the purpose of Autobot City is to harvest energy
All the while, Hot Rod and Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up into neighboring hills for an overview of the - which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure and natural surroundings
Hey
Let me out
Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain
() 9
: But we're not supposed to go beyond City limits
Chromo-Chicken
- a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing the positioning of a large metal road barricade
Hot Rod barrels through a sign which reads: " - ", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain

Daniel rushes to a set of    and peers into them
This is it
Now take a squint through those babies
Hot Rod, look
There's a hole in the shuttle
What
'
-   - The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle mars the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship
Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out of his eyes
10
'  - Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision, spots something truly disturbing -- -- Starscream, and several Constructicons inside the ship
(
) Decepticons
Drawing his gun, he starts  on the shuttle
This is for Ironhide
As so's this
Rays streak through the hole searing
He ducks away from the door
(') 'm hit
Standing behind a pair of Decepticons who pilot the shuttle, he turns to see
Firing out of the hole
He's furious
(') You imbecile, our cover is blown
It was your stupid strategy
: , Kup and the Autobot Construction Crew watch Hot Rod shooting at the shuttle
What's that darn fool doing
Hound looks up and points
() 11
: Decepticons
Suddenly it cracks open, and Decepticons shoot out of the wreckage like toys from a pinata
- In mid-air (shouting to forces) Attack
(he looks down and fires) Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's    the which crumbles and falls down the steep mountain
Hang on
Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at
Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid mode
causing them both to crash against the mountainside which starts a
landslide which Hot Rod "rides" down the slope, pursued by
Decepticon
() WHoooooooaaah - Blitzwing flies down in jet mode, transforms to robot mode, looks up at the "slide riding" Hot Rod and Daniel, transforms to tank mode and takes aim
(amused) Come on down, Autobrat
as Hot Rod tumbles, he covers Daniel with his arms and tries unsuccessfully to slow his fall

Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just coming to a stop at the bottom with Daniel
Not bad for an old timer
(gruffly) Old timer
That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city
You know what we used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts
(interrupting) Save it
transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts which
chew up the ground beside them
with Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into vehicle mode as shots gouge the terrain around them

Three new Autobots, , a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod's age, , a very muscular and bantering "Indiana Jones" type Autobot and  , the large and soldierly City Commander

Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and
rides up and over Kickback's back, using it like a stunt driver's ramp to
hurtle across the open space between Kickback and the doorway into the city
As Shrapnel looks up and reacts
Kup hurtles up and over Kickback's back just as Kickback is starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the bridge in the first place
Kup goes between Kickback's back and the doorway into the city- -clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the way and landing on the city doorstep, driving in as
transforms, shutting down with metal shields with a "clank" sound as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is to

Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - - skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city

distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest
Then, pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there
Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in, and lifts out -- , -- and holds it for a moment in his hand
The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot
Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes

Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden
In that case,  say it's survival of the fittest
So  hear a second on that
Aye
And against

Wait,  still function
Starscream kicks him out
Wanna bet

The last of the weak Decepticons is tossed, and the others dust off their hands
Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say - departed

Show yourself
have summoned you here for a purpose
Nobody summons Megatron
Then it pleases me to be the first
State your business
Bring me the Autobot Matrix
It is the one thing - the only thing that can stand in my way
You have nothing to fear
have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands
You exaggerate
The point is, he is dead
And the Matrix died with him
No
It has been passed to their new leader
Get it for me
Why should
What's in it for me

Behold - Galvatron

flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to a huge, new creation: Galvatron

His voice is deeper, different from Megatron's Long live Galvatron
And these shall be your minions
Their bodies are turned from battered Decepticons to

Cyclonus, the warrior
and his armada
To Cybertron
He roars with a mad power-rush, gets into Cyclonus (who will be his personal ship) and leading the armada, takes off for the distant stars

will rip open Autobot after Autobot until it is yours, Unicron
: - This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne room
It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old leaders, and a raised area where Starscream stands
37
The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held high, but ready for action should anybody question Starscream's rule
In front of him stands Astrotrain holding a huge Metallic  over his head
in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure

Dirge and others react to   and look up and off
Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts

Coronation
This is bad comedy
Megatron, is that you
Here's a clue
- as Galvatron transforms into cannon, as  hits him
For a moment, he retains his shape then piece by piece, he falls apart
Only a pair of boots remain on the floor
He transforms back to robot mode and confronts other Decepticons boastfully
Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes

It's like a terrible nightmare, Ultra Magnus
This thing - this juggernaut just ripped the first moon to shreds

But you'd better get here fast because
Suddenly, static obscures the transmission
Dad
Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles
This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put together
Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron
But what about my dad
He's on the moon between that monster and Cybertron
Daniel, 'll do everything  can for Spike
And what are we going to do when we get there
If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us
Maybe the Matrix can stop it
You're right
It can
What do you know about it lad
It's just a feeling
Hot Rod looks up and sees something
Look
43
- Decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the Autobots
To the shuttles
Galvatron is in the lead
There is no escape
, Galvatron will crush you just as the magnificent Megatron crushed Prime
And you'll die trying just like Megatron
Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron
aaaaaaaah
Autobot cur
You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you
There are plenty of Autobots for you
Ultra Magnus is mine
- Decepticons dive on fleeing Autobots
- As Daniel looks up and Arcee moves over to him protectively
Hot Rod looks at Arcee in the same way she is looking at Daniel
Stay close to me, Daniel
(to Arcee) And you better stay close to me
Arcee pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets hit by laser () 44
: No, you'd better stay close to me
Blurr is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle with the rest of the Dinobots as Decepticon
Grimlock is like a "spooked horse" refusing to be shut in the barn

zinging into each other
Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship
Filling space with incredible amounts of Dust, lava from inside the moons, multi-colored gasses, explosions and generally making a mess of space
(Note: think of this scene as the "Asteroids" video game
) As all of this is going on, they jam into hyperspace
Corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy, leaving only blurred images of themselves as
' emerges from the chaos
The explosions jammed my sensors

Damn it
They did the same thing to me off Beta four
: -  ' Possible song - optimistic adventure with the suggestion that all dreams might not happen
as both shuttles soar majestically through the vast depth of infinite space
(
) Congratulations Autobots, we've lost 'em at least for a while
So rest up
We'll refuel on the Junk Planet and work out our battle plan there
- Kup sits spinning yarns, leaning back in chair as Grimlock, Sludge, Slag and Swoop lie, lounge, sit with chin on hands, all listening like little kids to a bedtime story - in rapt attention Yep,  remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4 had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors
(impatiently) Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers
Want to hear good part of story

Tell Swoop good part

: Okay, Okay
The dust was really thick and then this gigantic Ick Yak
He is practicing sparring with a  - - a very high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons that test the user's skills, and reflexes
Hot Rod wears sparring gauntlet, and holds a small   and special shield
As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions to Kup's story
Don't you think we have better things to do now than tell stories Kup
Like what
Like maybe figure out how we're gonna stay alive
(  ) As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant "sees" its opening and gives Hot Rod a swift kick in the rear, sending him flying (o

Suddenly, the shuttle rocks from impact and and flames shoot out of large hole in wall Kup
Raise your force fields at once
They're armed with
"" as he presses firing button
(
) Moleculon Missiles
' Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out
It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several small moons
We will later learn that this planet is Quintesson, but for now, it's mysterious
The moleculon missiles streak after it like sidewinders
Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth
They're closing on us
Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon
Yeah, how'd you beat them
'm trying to remember
there were an awful lot of casualties that day
The missiles streak toward them
() 53
: (
) Oh yeah, we inversed polarities
(
) That'll tear the ship apart
(
) You got a better idea
With that, the ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid air
The missiles zoom past it
(   ) Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands on the controls
Okay, so you were right
Don't run your programs until they're debugged
Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start coming back
They're coming back
Let's just hope we've screwed up their trajectories
The missiles sidewind towards them, then their paths cross and Everything flashes white
Whew
Kup and Hot Rod look forward, their eyes, blinking, as if strained
() 54
: Yep,  thought we'd had it that time for sure
It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon
Suddenly, a hatch opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster claw shoots out at it
He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen
Dive
The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window and
crushing the area between Hot Rod and Kup
- As it explodes, flinging the Autobots inside down toward the Quintesson's planet
: ' : '  -  , as they man control panel in cockpit
In the background, Blurr and Arcee work to patch other holes in hull and Daniel helps them
Perceptor slowly plots coordinates on light-up table, oblivious to    of their ship
Kup and Hot Rod just bought it
can't deal with that now
() 55
: Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're gonna dog us until they see us dead
Ultra Magnus nods solemnly (cryptic) Then that's exactly what they're gonna see

blinding flash after which
remnants of the hull and superstructure explode toward camera and past camera accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence
Where the shuttle had been there is now
nothing
Just loose asteroids and clouds of space dust The Autobots have been terminated
Excellent
And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron
Suddenly, Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in pain
() Aaaah
Take me to Unicron
Aaaah
as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by Cyclonus' Armada
Hold for a beat, and then   on the dust cloud as
part of Ultra Magnus' shuttle flies into the clear
Arcee, Perceptor, Springer, Blurr are crowded together in cramped remnant of cockpit as Daniel and Ultra Magnus sit at the control deck () 56
: Did we have to detonate three- quarters of the ship
Seeing how they would have detonated four quarters,  think it was a good choice
, all holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold Perceptor
can you still locate the Junk Planet
Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities, however
(looks at Ultra Magnus) Holds his head in his hands as Springer grimaces realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat Ahem
yes  think  can
- which we see as dim shadow on the edge of space : small, falling object appears high above Quintesson and hurtles down, down, over and over until it is in view and we see it is
still cartwheeling down toward the planet below, trying to change the angle of his fall - He plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues to fall past shiny rock pinnacles of unusual construction as we 57
as Hot Rod falls into the sea, we Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with
a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking his head as he regains equilibrium, and
Then he transforms into auto mode modified for undersea action and starts riding off as he calls through intercom
(bubbling, filtered voice) Kup
Grimlock
Slag
Anybody him through undersea world as he rounds a "corner" of the Reef Wall and reacts -  ,  0 The   is tearing Kup to pieces and tossing the pieces across the ocean floor with its silvery metal tentacles Kup
He transforms and blasts
angrily streaks toward Hot Rod
Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him
Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid keeps coming
Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing
Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he
Shoots
Its hideous Optical Sensor
releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and "x" shapes and retreats
Don't worry, 'm not coming after you
() 58
: lowers his head and blows blast of air through head-piece
The air blast clears the water, revealing Kup's head and torso half buried in the "sand" ' as hot Rod kneels Kup
Say something
' as he turns head around to look up at Hot Rod and spits out a mouthful of sand (bubbling as he speaks) Fix me
Sure, Kup
right away
Hot Rod rapidly ' : Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them
Well
what do you think
Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out
(a beat, then grimaces) There's a piece missing
No way
(sifts through pile of lying at Kup's feet) See, this wasn't yours
it's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher
and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel
and this
() 59
: (moving up and back, bending arms and hands, , , ) Well,  still think 'm short a part
(sees Hot Rod hang his head) But all things considered, you did an amazing job, lad
Amazing
(brightening) Really
(rotates arm rapidly) Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator
Now, let's find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet
as he transforms it's evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing (
) (in vehicular mode) Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin' dim-wittery
told you a part was missin'
we watch Hot Rod and Kup move off into the distance as we: : Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area
Suddenly, there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of something terrible emerging through the muck
Hot Rod spins to fire, but Kup bats down his arm
(in humanoid mode) surrounding them
The Sharkticons are smaller than the Autobots, but they look ugly and vicious
Don't act hostile
'll use the universal greeting
() 60
: Universal Greeting
Watch
'll have them eating out of my hand
Or our faces
Kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon
Then, he addresses them
Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
(mocking, mimicking) Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
The Sharkticons look interested
( ) See, the Universal Greeting works every time
(pause) Now, without making any sudden moves, give them an Energon goody
Kup reaches into his belt, presses a button and pulls out an Energon cube
Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came
They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat
Then, the other six show up looking for cubes
This is getting expensive
Don't worry, they'll reciprocate
They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons
The Sharkticons eat them happily
Then, they back off, eyeing the two Autobots with menace
() 61
: thought they were supposed to reciprocate
(not sure of himself) Customs vary from place to place
Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them
The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards the fallen robots to an area behind a tree
For just a moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode
There, then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into automode and vanishes in a flash
It was Wheelie
- , Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a   within a walled compound
As we     we   and to establish that entry procession is being watched by
slender, spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five sided heads, each side bearing a different mechanistic face with a different expression on each - smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen
As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal evil they face, (
) Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on Golgonath Seven
Every place reminds you of some place else
(
) Experience, lad
You should learn to appreciate it
lot of good it's done us so far
62
as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply - as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a different color robe from others
He is watching arrival of Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace
as Sharkticons shove and prod them,  them into the holding pen and locking the gate
Then, they install can't transform
They're restraining bolts, lad
(looking around) We got to get a new travel agent
What is this place
-  , as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh, bass'o voice
It is
We saw him in the first scene, escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it
{Note: The script says **ranix here
Not my mistake
} The world of the savage Sharkticons and their cruel masters the Quintessons
They hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron, and put them on trial
But what if they're innocent
Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always the same - death
Unicron
Who's Unicron
() 63
: planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path
So that's the monster's name
wonder if there's any connection between it and Galvatron
Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in
(
) That one
All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in, grab Granix and pull him back out of the door
{: Another instance of the spelling of Granix} - as he points at Kup and Hot Rod Soon, you too shall receive your sentence
- Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons
Jury, have you reached a verdict
#1 We have your honor
(to jury of Quintessons) Guilty
Or innocent
repeat
Spare me this mockery of justice
repeat, guilty
or innocent
Guilty
() 64
: Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a ' {: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy
In moments, he is no more
He watches grimly through the bars
Not the end 'd wish for, lad
: , as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is      as it enters the atmosphere of
as it Where are we, Springer
The place where everything ends up after you throw it out
as he holds up hands and  fingers
Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as we see mountains of junk whizz past the window
Brace for impact
- It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk, narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of junk
By the time the ship lands, it is nearly indistinguishable from the junk
65
Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr, Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway, Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body sticking through the hull (pulling himself free of hull wall) Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise
Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders Wow
That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World
(working scanner, computer device, thoughtfully) The composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations
(baffled) How's that
(opening hull door with a ) He says the planet's made of junk
as they look out on landscape of "living" junk Yep, this dump is a dump
as he straps on We might be able to salvage this thing
(checks  , turns it on, off) Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves out to join them () 66
: Can  help, too
It's rough out there, kid
Stay inside and play with crayons or something
as she steps forward with a smile, a strange   "" in her hand think Daniel can make himself useful with
this
It used to be Spike's
(holds Grid-like metal frame "suit") Wow
Dad's exo-suit
He told me about it but  never saw it
Here, try it on
She starts helping him into the exo-suit
as he gets inside the "suit" which fits over his body like a grid-work metal "cage
" Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the gridwork which makes him taller and broader
He moves awkwardly, barely able to advance a step Just think about what you want to do before you do it
brows knitted, thinking
Don't fight it Dan-
He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways, then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces off walls
spinning upside down, then flips over several times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and that - amused, startled and unhurt
() 67
: (2) (continuing) It's kind of tricky
He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his feet and leans way over against Arcee for support
She laughs and pats his shoulder For the first time out, you were great
as he sends down  and motions to the others curtly Show time's over
We've got work to do
(he starts out) as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et
al
come down the ramp and look around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all around them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of weathered junk-rock
(
) (whistles) This must be the junk capital of the universe
- as they start  for parts to repair the ship, sinister Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them
Their leader, -, speaks to his fellow Junkions
- (in guttural, rusty, metallic rumble) Stop thief
No welcome-wagon, "hello stranger
" that good coffee flavor Yeah, or your money back
Wreck-Gar shows large   with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like barrel () 68
: - Operators are standing by
They laugh in guttural, clanking sounds and look out at Springer and the others who keep working as we : At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons
Greetings, noble strangers
They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at your door wondering if you can come out and play, than like serious robots on a serious mission
Yes, me, Grimlock, noble
Me, Grimlock search for friends
The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles
And who might they be
Autobots
Hot Rod and Kup
(feigning recognition) Oh yes
young one and an old one
Yes
You know friends
Where are they
They went down that path
He points to
It probably isn't lined with primroses, but it should be
You good friend to Grimlock reward you, sometime
() 69
: With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose path
" His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile
Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely contorted position
Why do you torture me
We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but this place sure is spooky
You have failed
No, Unicron
Ultra Magnus is dead
Then where is the matrix
Destroyed, with him
The matrix can not be destroyed
(pause) And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk
Stalk him
Cut him open
And bring the matrix to me
: They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister things start to happen all around them
This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap," and it has a malevolent red eye which lights up
Swoop walks past it in humanoid mode
70
It misses him by an inch
Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close
Get thump, thump, thump
(taps his head hard) - Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag revealing a spiked pit
Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony
He is just about to fall in when
Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him away an instant before he steps into the hole
Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami
Slag gets up
Beryllium balony
Argh
He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs toward him
The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them
He turns and sees the thing stocking in the ground
Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap model
Like your head
(laughs at own joke) Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground
Suddenly, a , speaks from o
s
() 71
: () Friends find
Look behind
(furious) Who say that
- is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed, killing everybody else in his party
He wears a necklace of Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a special  which hurls
He fears nothing, especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts into the clear
walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back and then shinnies up his neck and jumps onto
Slag's head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock Friends find
Look behind
Many Face lie
You fool
You buy
(eyes blaze, furious) Me, Grimlock, "fool
" (smiling breezily) Picture you got
Now fool you not
(he laughs in a wild, metallic cackle) Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag's head Me, Grimlock, no like you
as he scowls and quickly loads and slings it onto Grimlock's nose where it  making Grimlock yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his nose angrily (continuing) Doooooooow
Why boy hit by dose
() 72
: (folds arms across his chest) Wheelie say, find friends today
(nods defiantly) Grimlock and Slag react as we : "" Kup and Hot Rod stand on the platform over the Sharkticon pit
They are "bound" by restraining bolts
Before we deliver your verdict, would you like to beg for your lives
Kup turns to Hot Rod
Remember when you put me together today
(sarcastic) Sure, that's all  got to think about
know what part you forgot
(
) Silence or 'll hold you in contempt of this court
have nothing but contempt for this court
Suddenly, their heads swivel around to deaths heads
The platform drops away and they tumble
- Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the restraining bolt
() 73
: That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket
Watch this, lad
without it, 'm double jointed as Houdini
Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's bolt
Wish you'd figured that out a little sooner
Better late than never
In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn
Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back
They've got more Sharkticons than we have photon charges
Kup transforms to Auto mode
Let's hold a demolition derby
Then, he roars into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack into the wall
He transforms, too and does the same thing
As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over, new swarms of them come out
They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and transform to humanoid mode
Didn't even bend a fender
() 74
: Yeah, but look
There are a lot more of those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things
is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons
We can't hold out forever, but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill
They charge Kup and Hot Rod Kup and Hot Rod fire into them, destroying several, but are
Soon overrun
The Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal
-- (
) ( ) They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot mode
in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his tail, while stomping them with his feet
Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away
Me Grimlock want to munch metal
Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while
Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops them on other Sharkticons
suddenly back off and begin transforming (bowing) to the dinobots
75
Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon parts
never thought 'd be so happy to see those big bozos
He turns to Hot Rod
Me Grimlock no bozo
Me king
They look down, their angry faces showing
Sharkticons
Execute them
He points to the Quintessons
Me Grimlock say execute them
for a brief instant, don't seem to know what to do
Then, they charge the Quintessons
The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them
think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly
But what about our problems
We need a ship
You get a ship if  get a trip
76
He turns to the little, feral, robot
Who are you
The dinobot lifts up Wheelie
Him Wheelie, him friend
He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship
He points into the distance
is the strangest looking corkscrew ship   we've every seen sticking out of the ground
That's a ship
an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron
If this doesn't do it, nothing will
He sets a timer to 20 seconds
The
clicks down
now with a new bumpersticker which is a Unicron with a red circle and slash through it, looks very fidgety
Let's get out of here
77
They run over to a small space ship as
The timer counts down
takes off
Now, for the first time, we see what is really going on
Unicron looms behind it, about to do the big munch
They roar away
His mist surrounds the planet
They stop their ship in space
Five, four, three, two, one
An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly blowing Unicron to smithereens
They slap palms
Then, they look up, horrified
It isn't even dented
Let's get out of here
The great Maw opens and we hear a grand cosmic roar
Suddenly, the smoke and space junk from the explosion are sucked into his mouth
They try to fly away
() 78
: We're being sucked into it
Despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power, they are still sucked into
Whose great mouth shuts when he's got the human and the Autobot
: - ' as Arcee and Springer work on the ship, while Perceptor watches
Be sure the fittings are securely welded
as he uses        joints where new "canopy" is fitted (very fast, as usual) Absolutely, positively, definitely
as he helps Blurr install a junk part
This exo-suit is fantastic
(to Blurr) Want me to do that
Weld
You
Really
Well, why not
Give it a try, but think it through first
Daniel knits his brow, extends   - which is part of exo-suit
' as hand quivers and his finger shoots out a tiny flame which sputters, sparks and then goes out like a wet match 79
Practice, practice, practice
- Wreck-Gar starts to motion them to the attack, and the Junkions ready their weapons
- Forward, avanti, apfel and like, go for gusto
(stops as   comes from overhead and he looks up) - - (
) Hang on, this be industrial strength We watch
as he, too, hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force Decepticons
(to Springer) We've got to draw them off and then double back to the ship
with Galvatron piloting, races up and launches a particularly nasty looking missile which streaks   and
' Turns it into junk
Springer   at  , calling to the others Cancel that last order
, , as Arcee transforms and moves off in one direction
Daniel looks at Blurr who is starting to transform () 80
: What do  do
Transform
You can do

adds) it
Blurr   outblurring past     from Ramjet scorching by overhead as he reacts, looks around, thinks, brows knitting, looking off, reacting Transform
- Coming at him from one side, Shrapnel coming from the other side as he starts reaching for Daniel Human germ
as his Exo-Suit auto mode and takes off and drives through
, knocking them over
(
) Wooooh
flies up to a ridge in advance of his forces, motioning to them to split off and follow
- '   - They dash through the maze-like walls of junk, pursued by Sweeps, who strike them from above
() 81
: He lets out a rayblast
- Hitting Perceptor and spinning him around
Until he stumbles to the ground
Perceptor lies on the ground, stunned
Ultra Magnus stops next to him
Perceptor
Suddenly, shots tear into the junk all around them as
towards them
He suddenly transforms to cannon mode and fires
Blowing the sweep to protons
He transforms to humanoid mode
It appears that my lacerations were primarily superficial
Then move it
He takes off
Stays behind, taking a few shots at
which streak over in deadly formations
He stands and shoots
(
) Ultra Magnus
() 82
: Ultra Magnus turns to see
several yards down the junk-lined corridor
(
) Your estimated survival time is 10 seconds
He shoots at the junk walls
Then use that time to escape
The Matrix was designed for an emergency like this
'll try to unleash its power
But what if it doesn't work
Until all are one
Ultra Magnus' ray hits the walls and they tumble down, separating him from the other Autobots
His back to a wall of fallen junk, he pulls out the matrix
Galvatron pops out of Cyclonus and both transform, to land in front of Ultra Magnus
Struggling to open the leadership matrix
He puts his hand inside of it and gets a powerful shock
He pulls his hand out quickly
Damn it
Open it
He laughs
83
He still struggles
(baffled) Prime, you said the Matrix would light our darkest hour
Four sweeps fly   in formation
Galvatron pops out a communication device from his helmet
Sweeps, quarter him
- Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and
wrap around his arms and legs
His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's just about had it
He struggles for one last moment, then
Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot leader
As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered in the distance, he
(  ) It tumbles from Ultra Magnus' hands to
Galvatron's hands
He holds the Autobot Matrix
() 84
: Unicron, my "master," with this  shall make you my slave
Galvatron gets into Cyclonus and flies off : as he moves out and looks down at Ultra Magnus' remains (tearful) Ultra Magnus
- , , as they move up beside Daniel
Without the Matrix there is no hope
No hope at all
- as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle
Junkions are an interesting species
They ride themselves
That is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that if their vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver
They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock, war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense
"Slice 'em dice 'em
And that's all folks or your money back
" - as he roars into the lead and shows his teeth - Don't look behind door number two, Monty
It's time to play End-of-the-line-my valentine
Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo
(he charges) as they react () 85
: Get gone
Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor follow and we        as Springer and Arcee ride on either side of Daniel and Perceptor with Blurr bringing up the rear- - zig zagging back and forth to keep the Junkions from getting at Daniel
roars alongside Springer on his motorcycle and throws out laser barbed grappling hook, trying to hook Springer
Springer ducks first pass of hook
as he hurls as he catches goes flying off his motorcycle
,, He transforms into a motorcycle as The motorcycle transforms into a rider and hops on the new motorcycle and then
turns around to come back
He looks over, astonished
It's not hard to knock 'em down
It's getting them to stay down that's the trick
as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle
The Junkion looks down at his missing arm, digs around in the junk for a minute, comes up with another, and then transforms to a motorcycle
as Junkion rides over to her, starts belting her with junk sword They're indestructible
() 86
: (2) as he skids, stopping his Exo-Suit as he reacts to what's ahead They're everywhere
- as Junkions arise out of every junk pile in sight and, gibbering, singing their junk-rock battle song, start moving in as he stops and Arcee, Daniel, Perceptor and Blurr stop around him
They close ranks and look out at the Junkions grimly Perhaps they're not as vicious as they look
- as he gnashes his teeth and grins and then    which roll to show eyes like ping pong balls
Wreck-Gar makes blipping noises as he does this reacting to Wreck-Gar's noises and eyeball display (to Perceptor) Positive thinking gets    on my nerves
Suddenly, all react to    sound and wind of passing space cruiser    their

) It can't be

Hot Rod
He's alive

We're saved

: wouldn't count on that
(indicating Junkions) - as Junkions newly risen from Junk look up and point at Cruiser and make hostile signs toward it, shaking weapons, etc
-   - Hot Rod and Kup look down on the army of Junkions below surrounding their friends as they Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero have  seen such a sight
as he sticks his face up next to Hot Rod
Wheelie, riding on Grimlock's head, slips down to stand on console next to Hot Rod Maybe they make me king, too
Don't hold your breath, your majesty
- as he watches Cruiser descend and start gliding in for a landing - Steady as she goes, mob
Snoopy visitors get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film at five
(gives thumbs up sign, ) Everything must go by midnight
With a of musical, tribal excitement, the Junkions sweep Springer and our friends along with them, following course of landing Cruiser to Cruiser sets down and Junkions line up with weapons aimed at rampway as they watch door () 88
: as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and hand full of energon sticks followed by a very wary Kup, and the Dinobots with Wheelie riding Sludge's neck
, , - as they react to hot Rod's smile, Wreck-Gar trying to mimic that smile to his followers who laugh as he steps up beside Kup and gently pushes Kup's rifle aside (aside to Kup, still holding smile) Guns aren't exactly friendly
(through his teeth to Hot Rod) Neither are they in case you haven't noticed
(sotto) What was the Universal greeting again
- growls and slips a , out of a holster and starts toward Hot Rod with it (big smile) Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
- They look at one another, blink, then beam with smiles - Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
(nodding, smiling) Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
() () 89
: (') (presses energon sticks forward) As Hot Rod says this
Wreck-Gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his head and
all the Junkions smile and cheer and start chanting the universal greeting phrase, laughing, clapping their hands and dancing around, taking Arcee's hand and
taking Springer and Perceptor and Daniel out into center of a square dance type gathering, moving back and forth with them dancing happily, singing the universal greeting in a melodic, rhythmic way Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
- hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces and tries to enjoy it, and then hugs Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing and dancing as  goes
as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his leg Yuck
Me Grimlock, not a kisser
Me, Grimlock, a king
claps his hands and gleefully makes noises as he hops about, dancing with Junkions until we - as he stands on top of platform and getting silence and smiling as he waves hands all around - Have a nice day and please, close cover before striking, friends
Amigos, buddies and side kicks, Breep drit, aw rootie
So say the Junkions
(holds hands over his head) He looks at them, strangely
Where did you learn to talk like that
90
- He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some other organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman
On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial
- We talk
You talk some
looks around nervously
talk some
And now, Hot Rod for the news
Don't touch that dial
Void where prohibited
cheer wildly while the Dinobots react with uncertainty - as he points off and shouts happily
- By George kimosabes your smashed up, blotto friend, soon like brand new with ninety day warranty all iciban parts and labor is
- The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body parts, using junk when they can't find a part
Then, they lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him
Then, Wreck-Gar hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on
- Happy motoring
Cock-a-doodle-do
as he steps away from Junkion line of reconstruction and into group consisting of Hot Rod, Kup and Springer
(Ad lib jubilation) Ultra Magnus
You're all alive
() 91
: The matrix
All turn to Ultra Magnus
It's gone
And with it, all hope
No
(inspired) The matrix will not fail us
Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus
We don't have it anymore
Galvatron does
Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron
- His eyes light up
- Yeah
Destroy Unicron
Kill the grand poobah
Flush cosmic troubles down the drain
(almost chanting) Destroy Unicron
Kill the grand poobah
Flush cosmic troubles down the drain
The Quintesson ship in the
Listen,    don't want to rain on anybody's parade,   but how are we going to move the army to   Unicron
We don't have enough room on   that ship
() 92
: - No fuss, no muss
(to others) Hurry, hurry
Sale must end
Rush right on down to bridge and test drive latest with no obligation
Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in the Junk
You have ships here
- New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek sexy import with turbo handling
What's he talking about
Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space ship
Maybe the junk is the space ship
It takes off, bits and pieces of junk flying off as it moves
This is what  call traveling in style
: - as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the Matrix
(
) Listen to me, or suffer the consequences
Aren't we getting pompous
now possess that which you most fear
Unicron  and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet, knocking Galvatron to his knees
You will do my bidding, or
Unicron roars with laughter
() 93
: taste my wrath
He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix
- , we see Cybertron getting closer
Galvatron struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock
You underestimate me Galvatron
- He desperately struggles to open the matrix
The planet suddenly starts shaking
Galvatron is bathed in a reddish light, and looks up in horror
hideous transformation is beginning
The surface of the planet in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head
Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible head before him
For a time,  considered sparing your measly little planet, but now you shall witness its dismemberment
Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls through space
Landing on a protruding plate which sticks out of Unicron's chest
- He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him
- The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's back propel it towards
Cybertron, which, now looks lonely and vulnerable in space
94
He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open the matrix, but no cigar
No
Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous claw
Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound and troopers run everywhere
Decepticons
we're under attack
Scramble - Then his voice is cut off as
'  - Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the walls crash in
- Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as
streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous planet
Here, we see the true scale of Unicron
The fighters are the size of bees as they attack
He looks down on the swarm of fighters and
Breathes fire down on them
The fighters  and burn like popcorn in a blowtorch
In moments they disappear like sparks from a fire
Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as
Unicron's huge hand reaches down
scraping buildings and
tearing out gun emplacements
95
- ' as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the rockets, laser blasts, etc
are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron and swallows the fire barrage Stop feeding him, you fools
As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it looks like Unicron is going to have a field day tearing it apart
: - The massive Junkion ship and the corkscrew cruiser piloted by Hot Rod and Kup race through the dark void
don't believe it
- Hot Rod, Kup, Springer, Arcee and Daniel as they also look through canopy, astonished Wow
-  Destroying (
) Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup
, as they
Kup is glassy eyed
(entranced) Nope, never seen anything like it
() 96
: knew there had to be a first time
(using intercom) Battle stations
-  ' as hatches open and the Dinobots start
- Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass canopy as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a line
The Dinobots behind both ships
all diving toward Unicron's nose - - As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer - , as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach ' Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his neck
Transforms to Cannon and fires up at
bright panel on Unicron's chest
He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the gigantic robot to flicker momentarily
The monster lets out a
Then, reaches down, picks up Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin
He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing teeth
97
- As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst of fire
Flames lick the ship, but when the fire subsides, nothing has happened
- (
) Patented enamel resists fire, rain and corrosion
Five year warranty, satisfaction guaranteed
Or your money back
The ship fires back, dumping rays into
Unicron's face, but not really doing any damage
Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands and
tears it in half
- (
) Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable
And for a limited time we include
As Ultra Magnus, Perceptor and the others watch in amazement
- (') Free bonus surprise
Free bonus surprise
welding things
screwing things together
and kicking control panels to make them work
Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space ships
(
) Most unscientific, but
effective
98
As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face
Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked off
Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys
They are heading right to Unicron's eye
Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses
The Cruiser crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew
(
) Graaaaaaaaaaa
'  - The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's brain
As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates
He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we can assume is a robotic sinus or something) Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor in the giant, flickering chamber
Where's Hot Rod
Sees something in the distance
() 99
: don't know, but  hope they didn't get him
Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the Autobots
Debugoids
Quick
This way
They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the central nervous system or something
: - Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of miscellaneous junk
He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber
Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk, until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix apparently suspended in mid air
The Autobot Matrix
Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron
It will do you no good, Autobot
It cannot be opened
He stands up and walks towards Galvatron
() 100
: Not by a Decepticon
Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron
It is strange that we should find ourselves as allies
Suddenly, his body is violently twisted, and his arms are almost broken off
Uhhhh
Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from limb to limb
Of course, my master
Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod
Hot Rod dives away, as electricity seems to flash everywhere
He peers into the gloom
'    - Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk
Weapon drawn
Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's courage
There is no response
: - Unicron now stands atop Cybertron, fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees
Rays streak from his one good eye
() () 101
: (') His hands smash fighters
Fire shoots from his mouth
Now reaching Unicron's butt, start kicking
Me Grimlock kick Butt
Suddenly; he looks down, sending down a searing blast of fire
They transform to robot mode and fly away
Me, Grimlock, need new strategy
: -- Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor
Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring
Not noticing, they keep running
He tries to pull his foot out
No luck
Then, he looks up
The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him
He looks o
s
towards the others
Help
They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the antibodies
Daniel
102
, They dash down the corridor firing on
Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are so many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it
Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head, munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free
'm okay
They don't even see me
It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by the vicious antibodies
They must not programmed to catch flesh creatures
Us, on the other hand
Daniel
Try to find help
Arcee fires
- Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube
When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which
Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel
Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid
- He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo
: 103
- Daniel    rips through what seem to be endless caves on the torrent    of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall into
glowing lake
He stays under for a moment,    and then bobs up to see
' This is the central processing area for Unicron's "food" and "energy
"  long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy
The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion
watches this with awe until he sees
Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat, and in moments converted to nothing
Then, Cliffjumper and Jazz roll out of the line
He dashes to the shores of the glowing lake
Cliffjumper
Jazz
And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee
Bumblebee
Dad
, , They look down, but can't move because they are held by massive pincers
Shut off the control, Daniel
Daniel looks around
Then, he sees
() 104
: which controls the whole thing
He runs up a catwalk towards it
He reaches the flickering panel
What do  do
It doesn't have any buttons or anything
- He looks down
Shoot it, Son
But  don't have a gun
Use your exo-suit
He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can
Then, a spark comes out
It grows longer
Spike and the Autobots are about to go in
Hurry
Starts frying the command console
It keeps moving
Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in
He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his father about to be dropped in
He keeps firing
The panel starts exploding
() 105
: can't stop it
Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike
turns around and sees this
Dad
There is no answer
Play the moment
Then
Son
It is empty
The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom, smoking but alright
You did it
: Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room
Looking everywhere for Hot Rod
Come out, Autobot
We all must die sometime
Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face
stumbles backward
Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod
Hot Rod transforms to a car and races away
He transforms to cannon mode and fires
Hot Rod transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his legs
Then, he fires back at Galvatron
() 106
: Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and angering him
Raises his gun, then lowers it
No,  will crush you with bare hands
Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away
Galvatron jumps after him and catches him
Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid mode
Galvatron wrestles him to his back
The Adolescent Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger
Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts squeezing
We hear the crunching of metal
First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you
It is a pity Autobots die so easily or  might have a sense of satisfaction now
Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands
- Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye, while he crushes the Junkion ship
The walls crush in
The Junkions and the Autobots are   being smashed together
- Ashes to ashes
Junk to junk
Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod
Gasps
Die
On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead, spring to life for a moment and grasp the Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's chest
107
Suddenly, it lights up
miraculous transformation takes place
Hot Rod begins to grow at an alarming rate
Age shows on his face
He is stronger and wiser
Arise, Rodimus Prime
Optimus
He fires at Hot Rod as
Nooooooo
Hot Rod gets up
The shot doesn't even dent him
This is the end of the road, Galvatron
With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through
- Unicron's side
: Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix
Sticks his hand in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier
There is no shock
Then, like pulling the pin on a hand grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb
- The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires causing floods and generally causing havoc
- Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion ship, sending it hurtling
108
It tumbles through space
(   ) Suddenly,    he starts tearing into his body
Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle
: They are overrun by the antibodies
One takes a whopper bite out of Springer's chest
'm almost out of energy
Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above Then another explodes, then another
'  - Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel, Cliffjumper and Jazz
The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies
That's what  call the nick of time
Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at things
() 109
: Let's burn rubber
They transform
The humans jump in
- They race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand which shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be pieces of his brain
Then, they reach    what seems like a dead end
In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good eye
The hand comes in after them
An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the Autobots
When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus Prime
knew you had potential, lad
Autobots, transform and roll out
Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform
Daniel and Spike jump into him
Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him
: Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye
Followed by the others
An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits
Suddenly, Unicron lets out a loud agonized
seem to shoot out of every part of his body
Then, he spins in space like some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks
And then
110
We get the big visual explosion
: - Unicron's head orbits Cybertron
to Cybertron where and on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus, Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch construction being done on Cybertron below
Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness
Until all are one
