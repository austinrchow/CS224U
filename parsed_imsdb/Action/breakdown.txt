by Jonathan Mostow March 1996 Revised First Draft : of a video camera
The screwdriver blade of a Swiss Army knife  , methodically tightening a row of screws
to reveal: (- ) - On the backslope of a mound of rubble, a three-man crew (field producer, reporter, and cameraman, all wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman, , works to repair his malfunctioning minicam
Throughout this sequence, , the reporter, types on a laptop computer, oblivious to what is happening around him
, the field producer, lies on his stomach, peering cautiously over the crest of the rubble through binoculars
Beyond him we see an empty street
It is lined with buildings blasted by shells: a sawtooth wall in the f
g
, a ruined high-rise at the end of the street, billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language
How about it, Jeff
Jeff finishes his repair job, snaps the minicam closed
Done
Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket, scrambles over the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard
- frightened woman lurks nervously in the shelter of the wall
She is young, in her early twenties, with shining dark hair down to her shoulders
She's carrying an armload of books
- Jeff focuses the minicam
2
in the viewfinder we see the frightened woman
(
) Nice legs
Jeff ignores Howard,  the minicam  the street
In the viewfinder we see the flash of sun on metal
- - row of blasted windows
In one of the windows, a sniper crouches
Sunlight glitters on his rifle barrel
(matter-of-fact) Sniper
Where
High-rise
Top floor
Window in the middle
(looking through his binoculars) Stay on him
Stay on him
Now go back to the woman
Now
Jeff swings the minicam and -- - -- the image blurs, then holds steady on the frightened woman
Nervously, she peeks around the corner
(
) Back to the sniper
Stay tight on the sniper
Jesus -- look at him
He's about fourteen
Don't lose this
Jeff kneels on the ridge, minicam on his shoulder
3
- - Jeff's minicam    the sniper
The sniper sees the woman peeking and gets his rifle in firing position
He sees her
Stay on her
If she runs, widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame
Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at Howard
said he sees her
heard you
Stay on her
Jeff looks to Rod for support but he's busy typing, oblivious
Jeff hesitates, then lifts the minicam to his eye again
- The sniper, taking aim
The frightened woman decides to make a dash for it
She takes off her high-heeled shoes, inhales deeply, gathering herself to run
Jeff watches through his viewfinder: (under his breath) No
no
The frightened woman bolts, sprinting barefoot across the cobblestones, skirt lifted, slender legs flashing
4
Jeff jumps to his feet, waves the minicam, shouting: Sniper
Sniper
Sni-- The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused, breaking stride -- We hear a burst of automatic gunfire -- - In the window, the winking muzzle-flash of the sniper's -47
The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets
The books go flying from her hand
She spins to the pavement, her hair billowing
just stands there, a shattered expression
The camera hangs at his side
He stares at the dead woman as a pool of dark blood expands around her body
: () -  - 747 touches down on the tarmac
: - late-model Jeep Cherokee is parked at the arrival curb
, Jeff's wife, peers out from behind the wheel, scanning the crowd
Jeff, carrying a single bag slung over his shoulder, emerges from the terminal
5
Amy gets out of the car, grinning
Jeff sees her and hurries over
He drops his bag and they fall into each other's arms, kissing hungrily
These are two people passionately in love with each other
God,  missed you
Me too
Let's get out of here
Where's your equipment
Don't tell me you checked it
(holds up his bag) This is it
No camera
Jeff shakes his head no
No nothing
Again Jeff shakes his head
Amy arches an eyebrow
Ah ha
: '  - modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood
Not much furniture, but lots of books and 's
On the walls, blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling poses, plus many black-and-white scenery stills
Jeff's bag is unopened on the floor
We see two nearly full wine glasses on a table
The    a hallway  the open bedroom door
- More framed photographs
Amy lies in bed, curled up against a pillow
The sheets are tangled in post-coital disarray, the only sign of disorder in this neatly arranged room
6
Amy stirs, reaching her hand out toward the other side of the bed, which is empty
She opens her eyes, surprised to find herself alone
Jeff
No reply
Something catches her attention from across the room
She rises, pulls a loose robe around herself and pads over to a closed door
She knocks softly
Can  come in
(
) Sure
- walk-in closet has been converted into a small photographic darkroom
Moist 8  10 prints hang from a clothesline, bathed in a warm red glow
The images are moody black and white landscapes
Jeff stands over the developer, timing a print
Amy enters through a thick black curtain behind him
He doesn't look up
Couldn't sleep
Jeff shakes his head
Amy looks over his shoulder at a landscape photograph in the developing tray
remember when you took that
We had fun on that trip, didn't we
Jeff nods
Amy looks at him
After a beat: You want to talk about it
There's nothing to talk about
'mon, Jeff
() 7
: told you
quit
Walked out
end of story
That's   it
Jeff nods
Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility
You can't keep beating yourself up over it
He says nothing
What do you think
You could have stopped that girl from getting killed
You don't understand
He stops, lifts his eyes
It was different this time
He breaks off and pushes through the curtain
She watches him go
: -   - Jeff pours himself a glass of milk
Amy enters, stands on the other side of the counter
Jeff doesn't meet her eyes
After a beat: talked to Reynolds
(a beat) He thinks  could still get the job at the San Diego station
Oh, Jeff, you didn't
() 8
: Think of it
Low pressure, a steady paycheck
So  shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be
She looks at him, concerned
Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away
Who's running
It's good money, full benefits
'm tired of freelance
We could finally put some money in the bank
You know 'll never stand in your way
But you've worked so hard
Are you sure you want to throw it away
Throw what away
Don't you get it
don't do anything
sit, watch,  film --  let it happen
You're supposed to let it happen
It's your job
No, Amy
It's my excuse
She looks at him, not understanding
He hesitates
That girl
it's like  was paralyzed
wanted to do something, but  didn't
just stood there and watched her get killed
He looks at her, emotional
Please, babe,  need this
Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it
What do you say
() 9
: Amy looks at him, considering
We hear a faint Then it gets
and -- : -   -   - The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes   as the car whooshes over us, hurtling down the Massachusetts Turnpike
In a   , with  , we see landmarks form the cross-country trip: a Pennsylvania Dutch farmhouse, a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio, the Mississippi River, Kansas wheat fields, Loveland Pass and the Continental Divide
: - The middle of nowhere
Sand, weeds and sagebrush two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon of asphalt
The Cherokee cruises along the road
Its Massachusetts plates seem out of place in this stark landscape
There are no other vehicles
, we see that Jeff is driving
Amy is sound asleep in the reclined passenger seat
In back, luggage, moving boxes, camera cases
- The
On the console are two empty Styrofoam McDonald's coffee cups and a state-of- the-art Nikon Camera
Jeff stretches in the driver's seat
He forces his eyes open, fighting sleep
He reaches for the coffee cup
it's empty
He glances into the back of the Jeep
There is a thermos of coffee on the back seat
Keeping one hand on the wheel, he reaches for the thermos and fumbles it to the floor
He strains to reach it
He doesn't notice
10
- 200 slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the highway along a small road that cuts across the desert floor
The pickup, equipped with oversized tires, roll bar, and a  whip antenna, bounces over the uneven terrain and turns onto the highway, stopping just before entering Jeff's lane
- Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into the road in front of him
Jeff drops the thermos and spins the wheel
Amy's eyes fly open -- - The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid
The Ram jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past, averting a collision by inches
- Jeff expels a breath
Amy turns to see the pickup stopped in the road
She looks at him, concerned
Jesus, Jeff
Sorry
took my eyes off the road
(seeing thermos on floor) Maybe it's time we took a break, you know
Jeff nods, looks in the rearview mirror
- halted in the middle of the road
Inside, dimly-visible through tinted windows, are two figures in cowboy hats
The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the finger
11
angry at himself
He looks over at Amy
'll pull over next chance we get
(a beat) Sorry
He glances in the rearview again, still a bit shaken
: - small desert gas station/mini-mart just off the highway
sign over the building: "Last Gas For 30 Miles
" The Cherokee is parked at the pumps, hood raised
Jeff comes out of the mini-mart, carrying a   plastic quart of oil
He unscrews the cap and starts to    fill the crankcase, careful not to spill on the new   engine
In the b
g
, Amy is visible inside the store,   browsing a magazine rack
- Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide, The Desert Southwest
stands nearby, perusing the magazines
He glances in Amy's direction, notices what she's reading
On vacation
Amy looks up at him
He's 50ish, plain-looking, friendly, wearing a "
" logo baseball cap
Sort of
We're moving, actually
Whereabouts
Amy hesitates
She's not used to talking with strangers, but the guy seems harmless enough
California
We thought we'd take the scenic route
() 12
: Huh
In that case, you oughta try the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles west
Real pretty, makes a loop through the hills, then hooks back up with the highway
Amy smiles politely, moves toward the cash register
Thanks
'll mention it to my husband
The Trucker tips his cap
Okay, then
Good luck
Enjoy the rest of your trip
- As Jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him
The driver, , climbs out
The other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up
Earl is a beefy man about Jeff's age
He wears a sweat- stained Western hat, cowboy boots and a -shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps
He saunters over to the Cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over Jeff's shoulder
Jeff senses something behind him, turns
His eyes widen as he sees Earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before
Earl stares at him, unsmiling
(flatly) Nice car
Jeff is in an awkward position
He's got a half-full upside-down bottle of oil in his hands
If he lifts it now, he'll spill on the engine
He turns his gaze back to the engine, decides to keep pouring
Thanks
Earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in
Jeff watches him, wary
() 13
: Air,
, leather --  guess you sprung for the whole nine yards
guess
Then again, out here, what you really need's a
radio
Is that right
The oil bottle empties    out
Relieved, Jeff pulls it away and screws back on the    crankcase cap
He shuts the hood with a thunk and moves    around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle    from the tank
Earl blocks his path
'Course, if you use a
, you gotta have a handle
Jeff says nothing
This is not a friendly conversation
How about Shit-for-Brains
(beat) You damn near killed us back there, boy
Look, 'm sorry,  didn't see you
You pulled out in front of me
The hell  did
saw what happened
Looking past Earl, Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini- mart with a bag of groceries
He speaks carefully, anxious to avoid a confrontation
How about if we just forget it, okay
'm sorry it happened don't want any trouble
(snorting) Yeah
bet you don't
() 14
: Earl glares at Jeff before turning away
He passes Amy, gives her a broad smile
Howdy, ma'am
Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee
Amy takes in the situation
She nods politely
Earl continues into the mini-mart
She approaches Jeff, puzzled
What was that about
Nothing
Guy in the truck
Thinks  tried to hit him
Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who has not moved during the scene
He looks back at the mini-mart
'mon, let's go
You want me to drive
Later
Just get in
Is something wrong
No, let's just go
Jeff climbs in behind the wheel
Amy glances at him and gets in the car
Jeff keys the  and pulls away
-  - As Jeff steers back onto the highway, he glances in the rear-view mirror, sees -- Earl coming out of the mini-mart, staring after the disappearing Jeep
() 15
: Jeff shifts in his seat, relieved to be getting away from there
Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75, then 80, then 85
This isn't the Grand Prix, you know
Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator
The needle sinks back down to 65
She gives him a long contemplative look
What's bothering you
told you
Nothing
(pause) The guy was an asshole
Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror, Jeff nods toward the grocery bag, trying to change the subject
What'd you get
Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food
Junk food fiesta
Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies
can you believe they still make this stuff
You kidding
It's probably gourmet cuisine around here
: -  - Far below us, the Cherokee traces the empty highway
There are no buildings, no houses, no other vehicles
: -  - Jeff drives in silence
Amy stares out the window, bored
Looking for a distraction, she picks up a cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label
() 16
: (trying to brighten the mood) This is crazy
Look at this
Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts
She gives him a playful glance
What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts
Jeff shrugs, disinterested
dunno
Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car
Very funny
(beat) Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars
What would you do with that
Jeff stares out the window
He's not into this
don't know
Look, Amy, 'm not -- Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them -- Sonofabitch
My camera
He stole my camera
(startled) Who
The redneck at the gas station
He lifted it right under my nose
My brand new Nikon
(pounds wheel in frustration) Goddammit
Should we go back
() 17
: What's the use
He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard
Look, maybe if we call the cops -- Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks
What the hell
The car gives another jolt
What'd you do
Nothing
-- warning light flashes on the instrument panel
The brakes and steering lose power
The engine quits cold
Hang on --  can't steer
The  bucks and
After a few , it jerks to a halt, just beyond a crest in the road
For a moment, they sit there dazed, staring ahead at the empty road
Then Amy notices an object on the floor -- the Nikon
She picks it up
(deadpan) Found your camera
He rolls his eyes
He yanks the hood release and gets out
- Steam pours from under the    hood of the Cherokee
Amy gets out and looks around    at the scorched wasteland
Jeff goes to the front of    the car, gropes under the hood for the release latch
He     yanks his hand away, burned by the hot metal
Ow
() 18
: Are you okay
'm fine
Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn
She reaches out
(annoyed) said 'm fine, okay
Jeff lifts the hood, examines the engine
He tugs on a cable, checks the battery connection and radiator
He goes to the passenger's side and takes a hand-held cellular phone from the glove box
He dials zero and hits "send
" The
Out of range
Jeff grunts, tosses the phone on the seat
It bounces and lands on the floor
Amy watches as he returns to the engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap
What's going on, Jeff
What's it look like
'm trying to fix the car
Not the car
What
What's going on with you
Jeff busies himself with the engine, not answering
It's been a month since you got back
You can't keep shutting me out like this
Jeff says nothing
Jeff, 'm talking to you
() 19
: (flaring) Look,  really don't want to go into this right now
'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere
So could we maybe just fix the -- He stops in mid-sentence
There is a  in the distance
They look down the road
Christ, not these guys
'  - approaching fast on the road
As it streaks past, Earl yells and launches a beer bottle from the window
The on the asphalt
watching the Ram speed away
Asshole
(looking down the road) Jeff -- quarter-mile away, the pickup is slowing
It pulls a -turn and stops, facing the Cherokee
It just sits there,
What the hell
What's he doing
don't know
Jeff watches the pickup, frowning
Then, from the opposite direction, they hear a
They turn and stare at -- 20
- coming over a crest in the road
It's a huge eighteen-wheeler
white 1988 Peterbilt
It grinds into low gear and slows,
The  comes to a halt with a  of compressed air
the    again
It pulls another -turn and drives away, melting into the desert
breathes a sigh of relief
The driver dismounts from the cab, leaving the We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini- mart
He removes his cap, revealing a shock of prematurely white hair
He is well-shaven, his clothes immaculate
His name is Red
() You folks all right
Yeah
Our car broke down
(chuckling) figured that much
You want a hand pushing it off the road
Thanks, 'd appreciate it
Amy, you want to steer
Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral
Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder
As they push, Jeff glances at the  antenna on Red's cab
Think you could radio a tow truck for us
sure would if  could, mister, but my
blew a fuse this morning
'm waiting till  hit the truck stop on -40 to get it fixed
() 21
: How far is that
About 60 miles
(disappointed) Oh
Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down at the exposed engine
'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines
Used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up
Now it's all computers and chips
It's a new car
That could be the problem
You been running it pretty fast
Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look
It's subtle, but Red notices
Tell you what
If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road
Belle's
They got a pay phone
You could call a tow truck from there
Jeff considers this, glances back to where the Dodge Ram was last seen
Nice     of you to offer
But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along
Amy rolls her eyes
Red sees the look, trying not to smile
He glances up at a small plane flying overhead
() 22
: (casually) Suit    yourself
Not many cops on this    road, that's why the truckers use    it
Maybe you'll get lucky
(tipping his cap) Good    luck
He turns and heads back toward his truck
Amy looks at Jeff
She waits till the trucker is out of earshot
Are you nuts
We don't know this guy
He's offering to help
It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along
It's 100 degrees
You really want to be stuck out      here
Amy, 've got my equipment in the car
All our stuff
What if those guys come back and we're not here
(turns away, quietly to himself) Jesus
don't be stupid
Amy hears this
She's had enough
Flares
Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride
In the b
g
, the  is
Then, mad and careless: Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston
She turns away
The truck starts to pull out
She bites her lip, thinking, then steps into the road and flags the truck down
Red brakes
Excuse me
Do you think you could drop me at that diner
() 23
: (surprised) Sure thing
How about you, mister
could take you both just as easy
That's okay
My husband wants to stay with the car
'll just get my purse
She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse
Jeff follows, lowering his voice
What do you think you're doing
'm going to the diner
'm going to call a tow truck
Then 'm going to order an iced tea and wait
Good-bye, Jeff
(firm) You're not riding with that guy
End of story
You wanted to be alone
Well
you're alone
Why don't you take the time to get your head together
She walks to the truck
Jeff stands there
She climbs into the cab
Red moves some papers out of the way
Watch your step, ma'am
She pulls the door shut
The    and pulls away
Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the distance, flashers blinking
After a beat, the flashers cease
: - Beneath a blazing sun, Jeff paces restlessly in front of the Cherokee, checking his watch, wiping beads of sweat from his face
He looks down the highway
() 24
: Nothing in sight
Extremely bored, he wanders over to the raised hood and studies the engine again
After a few moments, something catches his eye
Curious, he kneels down and peers under the chassis
He frowns
'  - dangling under the engine
Oh for Christ's sake
He pulls his Swiss Army knife  from his pocket and slides under the car
Working with   the screwdriver blade of the knife, he reconnects the plug  to its socket
In the process, his hands and shirt  become stained with grease
Jeff slides out from under the car, brushes himself off and gets behind the wheel
He tosses the Swiss Army knife on the center console and keys the ignition
The to life
: - The Cherokee speeds down the empty highway
- Jeff drives, a determined expression
- The Jeep blows past
: '  - weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food
" There is a phone booth outside
The Cherokee pulls in and parks
Jeff  the , heads for the entrance
25
' - Dark and dingy
Formica tables, a bar
Chunky customers in -Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and watching a football game on a big
Jeff enters and all conversation stops
The other patrons turn and stare
After a moment, they return to their beers
Jeff glances around
No sign of Amy
No sign of Red
bored-looking  stands behind the counter, preparing a sandwich
Behind him, a blackboard menu
Jeff approaches
Excuse me
The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand
was supposed to meet my wife here
The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:    Yeah, so
Dark hair, slender, about five- five
Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt
pale blue what
Benetton shirt
The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an order slip
Hank
Your order's ready
(to Jeff) been busy
They come and go
It would've been within the last half hour
She might've been with a trucker
trucker
() 26
: Guy with a baseball cap
Driving an eighteen wheeler
The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head
Don't ring a bell
You sure
The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out: Hey
Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap
Anybody see 'em
Jeff looks up and down the counter
Blank faces, a few disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no
disheveled female barfly, , grins up at him
Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy
few of the regulars chuckle at this
Jeff ignores them, turns back to the Bartender
Could she have left a message with another one of your employees
Don't see how
'm the only one who works here
Jeff scratches his head
This doesn't make any sense
don't understand
Is there another Belle's Diner
(chuckles) No siree
Definitely not
Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around
An elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him
They whisper to each other
() 27
: (under his breath) Shit
He turns and goes outside
' - Jeff squints in the bright sunlight
Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner
He peers up at the sign
It says "Belle's," all right
He walks to the phone booth, looks inside
The phone book is missing
He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone
Phone works okay
He hangs up
He stands there for a moment, scanning the horizon in all directions
There is nothing else out here, nowhere else she could have gone
Jeff marches back into the diner
- Jeff goes to the Bartender
Excuse me, how far is the next town
About twenty miles
Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her  was here
Tell her to stay put till get back, not to move
Would you do that, please
(shrugs, bored) Okay
Jeff regards the Bartender skeptically
He takes one last look around, then heads out
28
' - Jeff marches briskly to his car and opens the door, forgetting to deactivate the alarm
The
Jeff fumbles for the remote and shuts if
- The Cherokee pulls out of the parking lot, kicking up gravel
: - The stereo is off, the windows rolled up
Jeff drives, his jaw set tightly
The speedometer reads 88 mph
: - The Cherokee crests a rise
- and then across the desert plain, traveling on another road, he sees it
The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy
Cruising leisurely
Jeff presses the accelerator
- The Cherokee turns sharply onto the other road
-   - The Cherokee speeds down the road, gaining on the Peterbilt
It comes up behind
29
- Jeff  his , flashes his lights
'mon, you fat-ass
Pull over
Either the driver doesn't notice, or he's ignoring Jeff, but the truck does not slow down
Jeff shifts into the oncoming lane and pulls alongside the cab
He  again and waves, gesturing for the truck to pull over
But the Peterbilt maintains its speed
Jeff cranes his neck to get a glimpse of the driver
It's Red, alright
But he's wearing a different cap
this , we can't see into the passenger side of the cab
Red peers down at Jeff, puzzled
Jeff shouts at him, waves: Pull over
Pull over
Red suddenly notices something ahead in the road, his
Jeff looks up, sees -- An  camper approaching in the oncoming lane
Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the  whooshes past in the opposite direction,
Jeff is rattled, catching his breath
He swings back onto the road
Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt, then starts weaving and braking, forcing the truck to slow
() 30
: Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop
Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red climbs down from the empty cab
(: Throughout this scene, various cars and trucks pass in either direction
) Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing
was signaling you to stop
Didn't you see me
No
Jeff reacts
How thick can this guy be
Where's my wife
Huh
My wife
Where is she
Red gives him a puzzled look
How should  know where your wife is
checked at the diner
No one saw her there
Mister,  don't know what you're talking about
Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts
You gave her a ride
You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner
Red searches his memory, trying to be as helpful as possible
He shakes his head
() 31
: Nope
Sorry
How can you not remember
It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes
Red gives him a peculiar look
Mister,  never seen you before in my life
Suddenly, there is a loud  from inside the cab -- the
(
) (filtered) Breaker, breaker -- Iron Man, you copy
(reacts) Your radio works -- (locks eyes with Red) What the hell are you doing --
Jeff freaks out, circling the truck, calling loudly: Amy
Amy
You in there
Red shrinks back, unnerved
Look, mister,  don't know what you want, but -- want my fucking wife, is what want
What have you done to her
Red's eyes dart to something in the distance
Jeff catches this, turns
' Cruising toward them
Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves frantically
The patrol car switches on its flash bar and speeds up, pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt
() 32
: , 50ish, climbs out, sizing up the situation
Jeff runs over
Officer,  need your help
What's your problem
don't know, this guy has my wife
Calm down, sir
Tell me what's going on
Jeff catches his breath
don't know what the hell's going on
Last time  saw her she was with this guy in his truck
Now he's saying he's never seen her
Officer, he's crazy --  don't know what he's talking about
Don't lie, you son of a bitch
The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster
just a precaution
All right -- everybody just calm down
(to Jeff) Sir, you want to tell me what happened
Our car broke down
This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone
But she never showed up
(turning to Red) Sir
() 33
: don't know, officer
'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife swear,  never seen the guy before
And you didn't give his wife a ride
No, sir
He's lying
The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them, unsure what to think
He turns back to Red
Sir, all right with you if search your truck
Hell yes, officer
Go right ahead
Name's Red, by the way
Red Barr
(pulls out his wallet) My permits are all current
You can check 'em out
That won't be necessary yet
Just stand back behind the line
Both of you
As Red closes his wallet, several credit cards fall to the ground
He bends to scoop them up
Jeff eyes this suspiciously
The Sheriff climbs up into the truck
- The Sheriff pokes his head inside, looks around
Pretty much what you'd expect in a long-haul big rig: a  radio, a plastic Jesus, a map of the
taped to the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker 's showing where the truck has been
() 34
: The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind blanket is folded over a foam mattress
stained pillow rests on top
- Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the Sheriff climbs down from the cab, wiping his hands
(to both of them) All right, let's see your license and registration
Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over 's
The Sheriff examines them, comparing faces to pictures and writing down names
What are you hauling today, Mr
Barr
Nothing, empty load
'm heading to Fresno for a pick up -- ball bearings or something
(eyeing him) Long way to go empty
Tell me about it
Too much competition nowadays
One horse guys like me gotta drive halfway 'cross the country just to get a payin' job
(to Sheriff, impatient) Are we gonna keep looking or what
The Sheriff hands back the
's
Yes, we are
(to Red) Sir, 'm gonna have to see everything
No problem
understand
35
- Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy padlocks
Grunting, he raises the slatted
It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy
The cavernous interior is mostly empty, except for a few randomly strewn cardboard boxes, too small to contain a person
(re: boxes) Those yours
Yeah
Personal stuff
Clothes and whatnot
You want to take a look
The Sheriff considers it, shakes his head
No
think we're pretty much done here
You're free to go
(reacts) Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec
That's it
You're not going to question him anymore
Sir,  searched the truck
There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle
Red has been looking on
He chimes in, trying to be helpful: Look,  don't mean to butt in, but maybe you got my truck confused with someone else's
(lunges) Go to hell, you sonofabitch -- The Sheriff grabs Jeff, holds him back
() 36
: Hey
Hey
You want to get arrested
Now the man has a point
This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck
Maybe you did get them mixed up
Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat, then bolts suddenly for the front of the truck
He yanks open the door and leaps up into the cab
Hey
The Sheriff jogs after him
Red walks to the cab, unconcerned
- Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy
He tosses aside a jacket, rifles papers on the floor
There is nothing
- Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching the cab
Red watches calmly
Mr
Taylor, either you come down from there or 'm going to have to arrest you
Jeff gives up reluctantly
He looks lame and desperate and he knows it
He steps down from the cab, gritting his teeth
It was him
It was this truck
Uh-huh,  can see that
Did you get a license plate
Jeff stares at him, knows where this is going
No
What about the information on the door panel
You recall any of that
() 37
: wasn't paying attention
The Sheriff studies him a beat, nods
Mr
Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today
What does that have to do with anything
Well, for starters, maybe she left you
don't believe this
've seen it a hundred times
Lovers, married couples, gay guys
You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it
Hell, 've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa
Jeff stares at the cop
Emphatic: My wife did not leave me
(cuts in) Officer, 'm sorry, 'd like to stay and help, but  really got to make it to Fresno
understand
Go ahead, sir appreciate your cooperation
This is insane
You're just going to let him go
've got his information
If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look
() 38
: Much obliged
(to Jeff) Good luck findin' your wife, mister
No hard feelings
Red climbs into the cab
Jeff watches helplessly, resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do
The Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio
As the truck drives off, Jeff goes over to the cruiser
Sir,  believe you that your wife is missing
Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me
The point is 'm trying to help
He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it
The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way
My deputy's name is Len Carver
He's a good man
He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing
Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in
The Sheriff softens, his tone sympathetic
If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here
Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare
Either way, she'll turn up
As Jeff stares at the Sheriff, the police
(
) (filtered) Sheriff, this is dispatch
Mrs
Gilbert's locked out of her trailer again
Can you respond
(into mike) 10-4, dispatch
Tell her 'm on my way
He racks the mike
() 39
: want your name and badge number
The Sheriff looks up at Jeff, sighs
Sheriff Arthur Boyd
226-93
This really isn't necessary -- Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit
'm noting the exact time of this conversation
10:52 (exhaling) Suit yourself, Mr
Taylor
The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away
Jeff is left standing on the side of the road, desert in all directions
: - wall is covered with missing persons' notices
Photographs of men, women and children stare back at us
Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the notices
to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces
It's a creepy feeling
Several yards away, , a young puffy-faced lawman, sits at a desk filling out a form
Jeff looks shaken
Is this a recent picture
Jeff glances over
Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet- sized photograph of Amy
Two months old
She still wear her hair like that
Yes
() 40
: The Deputy resumes filling out the form
He clicks his tongue sympathetically
We'll certainly do our best, Mr
Taylor
There's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year
Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the
-- all vanishing without a trace
Jeff stares at the faces
Now 'm not saying she's one of them
sure hope not
But unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the
won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours
Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the photograph to the form
He looks up at Jeff
Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled
How's that sound
Jeff clenches his jaw
: '  - From this high vantage point, we see Jeff's car approaching
- The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building
Jeff gets out and walks inside
'  - Jeff enters, looks around
It's the same scene as before: same Bartender, a slightly different cast of characters
No sign of Amy
() 41
: Jeff advances to the Bartender, who stands at a sink rinsing beer mugs
Did she come in
(looks up, uninterested) Didn't see her
You didn't see her, or she didn't come in
Buddy,  told you the last time
'm busy
Maybe she came in, maybe she didn't
All  know is, didn't see her
Jeff looks around, not particularly trusting the Bartender's skills of observation
He grinds his jaw
The other customers at the bar have been watching all this
One of them, an older grizzled , looks up at Jeff
(confidentially) None of my business, mister
But if  was you 'd take a look in the ladies room
The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer
Snickers from some of his bar mates, who avert their eyes when Jeff glances at them
Jeff knows this is almost certainly a put-on, but he can't take a chance
While the Barflies watch, poker-faced, Jeff walks to the door of the ladies room, hesitates, then knocks
His knock is answered by a wordless sound, -, - Amy
Silence
Jeff tries the door
It's locked
He rattles it
Another
Jeff puts his shoulder against the door, heaves inward
The door swings open, revealing -- 42
Flo, bent over the toilet, vomiting
She whirls around, a strand of spittle dangling from her lip
Hey -- what the hell you doing
Jeff backs away, yanks the door shut
The barflies chuckle among themselves
Jeff strides angrily for the exit
He stops at the door, takes one last look around
No one seems to be paying him much attention
He turns to leave
but something stops him
He can't put his finger on it
There's something wrong here
He stares at the other customers
Why do they avoid eye contact
Are they hiding something
He scrutinizes more closely
There is the gruff trucker, sitting at a nearby table shoveling food in his mouth
He's been averting his gaze ever since Jeff walked in
And then there's the traveling salesman
Overweight, sweaty
Popping vitamins along with his coffee
Or what about the shirtless biker, reading a comic book at the bar
Probably an ex-con
While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind, a trucker approaches the counter to place an order
The Bartender jots it down on a pad, then tears off the carbon slip
He places one copy above the grill and another in a pile by the cash register
Jeff stares, an idea forming
He approaches the bar
want to see your order slips
What
You write down the names
want to see them
What are you, nuts
don't have to show you jack shit
() 43
: Jeff leans in his face
If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile
The Bartender stiffens, stares him straight in the eye: You calling me a liar
tense beat
Possessed by a sudden impulse, Jeff makes a grab for the receipts
Before he can reach them, the Bartender's hand clamps onto his
Mister, 've had just about enough of you
Let me see the fucking slips
In one swift motion, Jeff overpowers the man and extracts the receipts
He starts going through them, fast, looking at names
, , ,  and
Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a Smith & Wesson revolver
Now, mister, you're going to have to leave
Jeff takes a step back
Everyone in the diner is staring
He stumbles backwards, heads for the exit
'  - Jeff exits, breathing hard, and runs to the phone booth
is occupied by a   with an awkward oversized frame, ill-fitting clothes
Jeff raps on the glass anxiously
Please,  need the phone --  have to call the police
() 44
: The Man looks up, dull and glassy-eyed
His sluggish demeanor suggests mental retardation
He hangs up and slowly opens the door
(drawls) My name's Billy
You the feller lookin' for his wife
How'd you know
Did you see her
The Sluggish Man hesitates
There's something holding him back
Jeff senses this
Please, if you know something, anything, tell me
( ) (a beat) seen her
maybe
What
When
Billy is about to answer
In b
g
, the Bartender sticks his head out of the diner
Billy backs away, spooked
Oh man
Never shoulda opened my damn mouth
Now 'm gonna git it
Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot
Jeff hurries after him and catches up, cornering Billy between two cars, trying to calm him
No one's going to hurt you, Billy
Just tell me what you saw
Billy glances around nervously, swallowing
She came in on a truck
big white one
Yes
Then she
she got in another truck
() 45
: Another truck
With who
Dunno
Some men
Bad men
They say 'm a dummy, but  ain't see things
Jeff reels, struggles to stay focused
Do you know where they went
Uh-huh
Route seven
Up by the river
Where by the river
Dunno
They don't tell me that kind of stuff
Who doesn't
The bartender
The men in the truck
Billy's expression darkens
He starts backing away
ain't talking to you no more
Billy,  need you to come to the police
If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me
Billy laughs
Man, you're the dummy
Jeff looks at him, confused
Don't you git it
The police is the ones in on it
Billy turns and runs back into the diner
Jeff's sickened reaction, we -- : 46
- Jeff drives flat-out, his face grim
The speedometer reads 100 mph
Keeping his eye on the road, he thumbs through the pages of a pocket address book
He picks up the handheld cellular phone and dials
'mon
work, goddammit
The " "
Fuck
- The highway intersects Route 7
The Cherokee slows just enough to take the corner without tipping over
It flies past a sign:   "Route 7 - North
" : 7 - The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert plain
The route is narrow and windy, forcing Jeff to reduce his speed
- Jeff drives, desperately searching for any sign of a truck
There are no other vehicles on the road
He keeps pressing the "" button
The " " over and over
- The road curves through a tunnel, then climbs higher, past sharp cliffs and drop-offs
Jeff follows the signs for "Route 7
" - Something catches Jeff's eye on the cell phone
For the first time, the "" indicator blinks green
Jeff immediately grabs the phone again and presses "

: There is a burst of , then we hear a The call is going through
(thank God) Yes
He waits for an answer
Hello, Steve
It's Jeff Taylor

The reception is very poor

Jeff holds the phone tight to his ear

Jeff slams the phone against the dash, furious
Goddammit
He punches redial, gets the " " , then glances up, sees a -- covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the road
The sign: "

The   to a halt just short of the fence
Jeff stares at it
() 48
: Shit
He grinds his teeth
Beyond the padlocked gate, the highway continues as an unpaved dirt road
He deliberates, then throws the Cherokee in reverse and does a three-point turn so he's facing back in the opposite direction
He looks up, sees -- has been hiding in the bushes off the road
It lurches forward and stops in the middle of the road, blocking Jeff's escape
Jeff's eyes widen in fear as he recognizes the vehicle and its driver: Earl
Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle
He raises it to his shoulder
(calling out) Out of the car
Put your hands where  can see 'em
swears, panicking
said get out, dammit
Now
Jeff stares into the rifle, deliberating
His hand moves to the gearshift
He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas
peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming for the chainlink fence
It  the
Poles and chain mesh go flying
cranks the wheel and brakes hard
The rear end of the Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road
He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle

jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit

The Cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted, storm-damaged road
He yanks the four-wheel- drive lever
The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7

the  on the washboard road surface, the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while -- keeps pace in the dust from its wake
Inside the cab, Earl can be seen speaking on a  transmitter
throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road
As the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as -- blocks the road at a construction site
More unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond
brakes wildly
To his right, a cliff goes straight up; on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine
He cuts the wheel left,  through the  and plunges into the ravine
bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope, through sagebrush and manzanita

clings to the wheel, tossed about violently, as suitcases and packing boxes go everywhere
The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and through the upper branches of a willow grove
As the leaves part, we see
a river
lands on the passenger side with a  and comes to rest half-submerged in the
jerks the Ram to a halt, leaps out and runs to the edge of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river
Sonofabitch
He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the slope
The world is sideways
Water rushes into the car
Jeff is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt
The with a
Jeff grimaces in pain
He looks around, blinking
The river is flowing right through the Cherokee
Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke cans bob on the surface of the water
Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release
The belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side
He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the driver's side door and pushes it open
He hoists himself through the door
Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee, levels the  and
51
ducks back inside the Cherokee, freaking
The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries to get out through the driver's side, he's a sitting duck
Jeff swears and looks around, seeing a metal camera case underwater in the back seat
He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield
The first three blows bounce off harmlessly
Then the   with a
He takes a deep breath, submerges and swims underwater through the broken windshield
Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water
Several items of debris from the car are floating on the current
Fuck
He begins moving downstream along the bank, eyeing the river
Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth
Sand swirls in the swift current
He pushes away from a boulder in his path
He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for air
Earl sees Jeff break the surface
He aims the  and the  near Jeff's head
Then Jeff is under again
Goddammit
Jeff struggles to stay in control
The current is turning swifter
His shoulder glances painfully off a boulder
52
Earl works his way through the brush at the river's edge
His foot lands between two rocks
He pulls it out, swearing
Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of Earl on the bank
Then he is down again
Earl works his way along the shore
Up ahead, the river runs over rapids before passing around a bend
Earl hears an  and turns
huge moving van has arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine
He shouts to the , pointing downriver
He's getting away
The Driver shouts something inaudible
Earl runs along the bank, ducking under low-hanging branches
Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving current
He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and swallowing a mouthful of water
downed tree hangs over the river
Jeff grabs desperately and takes hold of a branch
He's got it
Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object floating past in the water: the "90,000 Donuts" pack
Jeff tries to haul himself from the river
The bends under his weight
Then it comes free with a
Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water
Earl works his way along the shore
The unseen Driver of the van shouts to him from upriver
(
) Where is he
() 53
: He's in the water
just saw him
The river has turned slow again
Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to the bank
He drops to his knees, retching
Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver
For the moment, there is no sign of Earl
But he could appear anytime
Jeff gets to his feet, wincing
He looks up at the rocky canyon wall bordering the river
It's steep but scalable
He begins climbing
: - Jeff has climbed to higher ground
He lies flat on his belly and peers  a gap in the rocks at the river valley below
'  - The men have given up their pursuit
The moving van, a jumbo three-axle , has turned around and backed up to the edge of the ravine
stocky man,  (whom we recognize as Earl's passenger at the minimart), operates a gas-powered winch in the cargo door of the van
cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the river
Standing knee-deep in the current, Earl signals to Al while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels, then backwards out of the river
54
watching in amazement
He can hear only snatches of their conversation
can't believe you let him get away
You try chasing
through this shit
Fuck
this is what happens when you get one without the other
Jeff can't believe it
The Cherokee is being pulled backwards up the slope toward the road
He belly-crawls back from the outcropping, gets to his feet and climbs higher
: - Jeff has moved to higher ground
He crouches behind a stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below
'  - The Cherokee is now back on the road
Operating the winch with precision efficiency, Earl and Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the moving van
Once the vehicle is aboard, they stow the ramp and close the van doors
watching in amazement, straining to hear what Earl and Al are saying
Behind Jeff, a   on the rock
He turns, reacts
It's Billy -- the halfwit from the diner
Wielding a shotgun like a club, he swings the butt at Jeff's skull
Jeff drops to the ground, unconscious
55
: - There is a  as the  opens
Jeff lies inside, dazed and disoriented, blinking into the sun
His eyes won't focus
Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in silhouette
He can hear their voices: He coming around
Should be
clocked him pretty good
gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs
Rise and shine, dad
Jeff blinks
face slowly comes
Is it really Billy
The halfwit from the diner
Only he isn't a halfwit anymore
'mon, shake a leg
Jeff looks at Billy
Nothing makes sense anymore
But one thing is clear: Billy's mental retardation was all an act
(weak) Where is she
Give us some answers and you might find out
According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank
Is that true
There's some
yeah
Uh-huh
well, 'some' doesn't cut it
Your wife gave us a dollar figure
want the same exact from you
() 56
: (coming around; stalling) don't -- there's different accounts
the balance fluctuates
Fluctuates, my ass
If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history
(turning) What do you think, Earl
We been fucked with, is what think
Little slut lied to us
Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive
Billy nods, disappointed
Yeah,  suppose
Too bad
(peers down at Jeff) Guess you're not the donut magnate after all
(to Earl) Waste of time
Plug him
Earl raises a pistol
Jeff's eyes flash
(blurting out) Ninety thousand
Earl stops, glances at Billy
They both eye Jeff carefully
Say again
(emphatic) Ninety thousand dollars
faint smile plays on Billy's lips
He slams the trunk
- It's nearly pitch black
beam of sunlight shines through a rusted hole
It illuminates Jeff's eyes
() 57
: The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert
Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain
He braces against the confines of the trunk
The is deafening
The car hits a depression and jounces wildly
Jeff is thrown about violently
: - There is a  and the  opens
Jeff squints into the sun
Earl and Billy stand over the trunk
Get out
Don't try anything stupid
Jeff gets out, grimacing
His clothes are stained with grease and tire grime
He     sets his feet unsteadily on the ground, looks around
We see that he has been confined in the trunk of a    Pontiac Firebird
The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff
Red stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars at the desert below
He glances at Jeff
You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey
Jeff stares, a mix of emotions -- anger, fear, confusion
(barely able to control himself) What do you want
It's not me we're talking about
Question is what you want
Jeff looks at him with loathing
See, 've got something you might want to buy
Can't show you the merchandise right now, but  can describe it for you
About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds
'd say three, maybe four of that is tits
Black curly hair upstairs and down
Interested
() 58
: Jeff's anger bubbles over
You sonofabitch -- He advances toward Red
Billy and Earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground
Billy drives a fist into his kidney
Jeff gasps in pain
Red nods impassively
Bring him up here
Earl and Billy hoist Jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to Red
From here, Jeff can see a small desert town spread out below, as well as the highway leading through it
Red gestures
Welcome to Brackett, Jeff
If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it
One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a
hall
(pointing) See that building
Jeff follows his gaze
That's the bank
Brackett Commerce Bank
You with me
Jeff nods tightly
Then here's the drill
You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston
Got your wallet
Jeff nods
You ask for the money in cash
Small bills
() () 59
: (') Today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it
If the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem
It's your wife who's counting on you
How do  know she's still alive
Billy slugs him in the gut again
Jeff doubles over
Shut up
She's tucked away someplace safe
You get her back as soon as we get the money
Simple as that
Jeff compresses his lips
Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right
Jeff says nothing
Red raises a hand-held  to his mouth
He keys the transmitter
(into mike) Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate
(
) (filtered) Copy that, Iron Man
Red turns back to Jeff
Like  said, Jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing can do
Hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, figure you're fixing on calling the
,
-- even the 82nd Airborne
Jeff stares back
() 60
: Problem is, you can see this town for miles around
So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here
They gonna fly in
Drive in
Either way, we'll see 'em
So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead
He tosses Jeff the binoculars
Now take a look at the building with the flagpole
Jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars
The  , then  and   a small building with a police cruiser out front and a barely legible sign: "
" It's the police station where Jeff filed the missing persons' form earlier
(
) There's exactly two cops in this town
One of them's inside pulling ass duty; the other's on patrol in the foothills
Now a minute ago one of my men called in a non-injury accident on the -40 connector
Deputy Carver comes out of the building gulping down a sandwich
He gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights flashing
(
) It'll take that good ol' boy 20 minutes to get to the connector, another 10 to see there's no accident, and another 20 or so to tool his way back
50 minutes all in
The cruiser pulls away down the highway
61
lowers the binoculars and looks at Red
That's your deadline
If for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before 'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good
He smiles at Jeff
See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing
You do the legwork
We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way
If at any moment we don't like something, we split
Period
(beat) Helluva lot safer than sticking up 7-11s, wouldn't you say
They lock eyes
Red tosses Jeff a Windbreaker
Put this on
You can't go into the bank like that
Jeff puts on the jacket
It covers his filthy shirt
Red checks his watch
How about it, Jeff
Time to get the show on the road
Jeff's expression
: - Jeff stumbles and nearly falls as he descends   the loose rock at the foot of the mesa
He looks up at    the ridge, but Red and his crew have pulled back out of   view
Jeff starts across an open field toward the town,   first jogging, then running
62
- Jeff hurries toward the bank
He looks back at the mesa again
The gang has disappeared
Up ahead, a mud-streaked pickup cruises the main street
Jeff eyes it warily
Is it one of theirs
The truck pulls around a corner
- Jeff pushes through the main doors
It's a typical small town operation
guard stands near the entrance
Several customers wait in line for the woman teller
Jeff looks at the slow-moving line and swears softly
He doesn't have time to wait
He glances around, sees an older man sitting at a desk in the rear of the bank, the nameplate on the desk identifying him as Roger Calhoun
Jeff approaches
need to see the manager
need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston
looks up from his paperwork, hesitates at Jeff's appearance
Yes
sir
'm the manager
Would you like to have a seat
Jeff remains standing
He eyes the other customers nervously
Sir
(turning; preoccupied) What
said you can have a seat if you want
Right
He takes a seat across the desk from the manager, reaches into his wallet and brings out several forms of identification
() 63
: Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston
How long is this going to take
Calhoun looks at him curiously
Are you all right
(quickly) Yes, 'm fine
Look, that account only has $5,000 in it
How much can you advance me on my credit card
Excuse me
(impatient) My credit card
've got a $6,000 limit
Can you advance me the whole $6,000
Calhoun looks mystified
No,  can't
For non-customers the limit is $500 a day
Sir, are you sure you're all right
Yes, 'm fine
Just
transfer the money, okay
Calhoun raises an eyebrow and begins filling out the transfer form
Jeff eyes him, decides he has to risk it
He leans toward the desk
Look, 'm going to tell you something
Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay
(looking up; baffled) Sir
There are people watching -- () 64
: (
) Excuse me, you the manager
Jeff turns
wearing cowboy boots and a feed cap stands behind him
Yes,  am
Lady over there said to see you about a car loan
(indicating waiting area) Certainly, sir
Would you like to have a seat
The guy takes a seat ten feet away
Jeff looks at him, paranoid
Their eyes meet
Jeff looks away quickly
(turning back to Jeff) You were saying, Mr
Taylor
Just
transfer the money
: - Jeff enters and locks the door
He startles at his reflection in the mirror
He is sunburned, dirty, lacerated
He opens a cabinet and rifles through the supplies, looking for anything that could be used as a weapon
He tosses aside detergents and air fresheners
He picks up   the toilet plunger, pulls the wooden rod from the rubber   base
He swings it into his palm a few times, testing it   as a club
It's too bulky
He won't be able to conceal   it
He checks his watch
Time is running out
He takes one last look around the bathroom, then exits
65
- Jeff comes out of the rest room
The manager is behind the teller's counter
The cowboy is gone
In his place sits a middle-aged blue collar worker
He looks at Jeff
Jeff takes a seat, glances at Calhoun's empty desk
There is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands for wrapping currency
Positioning his body so no one can see, Jeff takes the letter opener and slips it into his sleeve
He scoops up a handful of currency wrappers
Jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller
Would you tell the manager  want the money in these denominations
The teller looks at him oddly
: - Jeff comes out of the bank with a manila envelope, glancing up and down the street
There's no sign of the men
He squints toward the mesa
No sign of them there either
He stands there
What's he supposed to do now
He checks his watch, growing anxious
Finally he is about to jog back in the direction he came, when
a Jeff turns
There's a pay  down the street
It again
He approaches quickly, lifts the receiver
'm here
(
) (filtered) No shit
can  that
How much you got
Jeff looks up and down the street, trying to figure out where they're watching from
He looks toward the bank, glimpses the manager peering through the window
The whole thing
Ninety thousand
() 66
: (
) (filtered) Good
Turn left and start walking toward the main road
Get in the first car that stops
When do  see my wife
(
) (filtered) When  say so
Now walk
The
Jeff hangs up and starts walking
: - Calhoun speaks on the phone
Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down at the bank
Is the Sheriff there
(a beat) Well, maybe it's nothing, but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange
: -    - Jeff walks along the road, carrying the envelope
Various cars pass in either direction, but none slow down
Jeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches
But the past, blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his face
Jeff continues walking, anxiously checking over his shoulder every few moments
His eyes narrow
The Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him
It slows, then brakes to a halt
The passenger door opens
Earl sits behind the wheel, aiming an automatic pistol
Toss the envelope on the seat
() 67
: Jeff stands firm
No
First you tell me where she is
Wrong, asshole
First you give me the money, then you find out
Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway
Jeff looks around, wonders if Earl would risk shooting him in view of passing traffic
Jeff hesitates, then tosses the envelope on the      seat
Earl opens it, reaches in and pulls out several      packets of currency
They are wrapped with paper bands       and appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds
He       replaces them and gestures at Jeff with the gun
Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around
Jeff complies
Earl sees that he isn't carrying a gun
He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic
Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck
Jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side door
Earl grabs his arms, yanks roughly and wraps them with several layers of duct tape
Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor
Do it now
Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the floor, facing the rear of the pickup, his belly pressed against the seat
Earl reaches over and pulls the door shut
He throws the truck in gear and starts driving
Jeff grimaces, looking up at him
gave you the money
Now let her go
() 68
: 'Let her go
'    Do  look like have her
What the hell -- Earl backhands Jeff against the passenger door
There is a  sound and Earl pulls a   from his pocket
He presses a button and raises it to his face
(on phone) It's done
'm heading in
(a beat; listening) Gotcha
He ends the call and tosses the cell phone on the dash
You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet
You think we picked you out of the blue
New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you
Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble
' He tucks the pistol in his belt
Jeff looks at him, seething
Jeff tries to squirm free
Earl sees it and belts him across the temple
Jeff slams into the passenger door, wincing
'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up
(mimicking panicked driver) Help, help,  ain't got no power
Earl laughs
Jeff has come to rest with his back against the door
By contorting his arms, he is able to draw the letter opener from his pocket
He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists
() 69
: Steering with one hand, Earl reaches into the envelope, pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeff's face
Jeff saws faster at the duct tape
You know what 'm gonna do first with your money, boy
Well, do you
Jeff glares at him
(fluttering bills under his nose) 'll give you a hint
Only one thing smells better than money
You wanta guess what
Earl laughs obscenely
He riffles the bills under his nose again, then stops abruptly, frowning
He looks down at the bills
What the hell
Earl stares at the bills
Jeff works feverishly behind his back
Earl pulls out another packet, then another, examining the bills
These are
it's nothing but singles
(erupting) You lyin' sonofabitch
There is a
Jeff wrests his hands free and lunges across the cab
He plants the letter opener in Earl's shoulder
Aaagghh
- The pickup veers across the center line on the narrow mountain road
It swerves back, over-correcting wildly, and drifts for the opposite shoulder
- Jeff seizes the pistol from Earl's waistband
Earl flails and knocks the pistol from his grasp
() 70
: The pistol flies onto the floor
Earl uncorks a vicious backhand
Jeff's head snaps sideways
He grabs Earl by the arm and twists sharply
Earl howls
- The pickup careens back and forth across the treacherous roadway
- Jeff gropes on the floor
His hand closes around the pistol and he swings it at Earl -- crack
Earl's nose erupts
Jeff reaches across and jams his foot on the brake
- The   and comes to a halt straddling the road
- Jeff swings the pistol into Earl's face -- crack
Earl tries to fend off the blows
Jeff creams him again -- crack
- traveling in the opposite direction pulls to a stop
He gawks at the two men struggling in the pickup
- Jeff aims the pistol at point blank range
Earl is a bloody wreck
His head lolls groggily
Where is she, goddammit
What'd you do with her
Earl sneers
Jeff is about to slug him again when he notices the two truck parked across the road, the driver staring out
() 71
: Jeff swears and wrestles Earl into the passenger seat
He seizes the roll of duct tape and binds Earl's wrists, then passes the tape under his legs so Earl is effectively hog-tied
He then slams Earl back in the seat, circles his neck twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of the passenger side headrest
Earl begins to gasp for air
The Tow Truck Driver gets out and approaches
Hey
You there
Jeff gets behind the wheel and throws the pickup into gear
- The Two Truck Driver leaps out of the way as the pickup surges forward, tires smoking
He stares open-mouthed after the departing vehicle
- Jeff drives, one hand on the wheel, the other brandishing the pistol at Earl
Where is she
(barely able to breathe) Fuck you
Jeff swings the pistol
There is a crack of exploding teeth
Earl's mouth erupts with frothy blood
You like that
How about this
Jeff hits the brakes
Earl is thrown forward, letting out a strangled cry as the duct tape chokes off his windpipe
Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch
You want to try 'em again
() 72
: He hits the brakes again, harder
Earl's tongue protrudes from his lips, choking
His face is red
How about an emergency stop
You want to try that, Earl
Where is she
don't know
Fuck you, you don't
He slams the brakes again
Earl's eyes bulge sickeningly
He is being choked to death
Stop
Is that what you want
You really want me to stop
'Cause  bet this baby stops on a dime
: - Traveling in the opposite direction, Sheriff Boyd is returning toward town
As he rounds a bend in the road, he sees -- - The Ram driving erratically and weaving back and forth across the road
- The sheriff reacts
What the hell
- As the Ram passes, Sheriff Boyd throws the cruiser into a 180-degree turn
He flicks on the  and takes off in pursuit
73
- Jeff glances in the rearview mirror
The cruiser is on their tail,  , lights flashing
He swears and pumps the brakes in a series of rapid bursts
End of the line, Earl
How about it
You gonna tell me
She's with Billy
Yeah
Where's that
don't know
Driving around
Jeff hits the brakes again
- Sheriff Boyd jerks the wheel to avoid a collision with the pickup as it slows and accelerates in rapid spurts
(on radio) Repeat,  am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup
Request back-up, repeat, request back-up
- The cruiser pulls up alongside the pickup
- Boyd reacts in amazement to what he sees -- Jesus Christ -- (on radio) Dispatch
Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor
Boyd taps his brakes, falling back behind the pickup
- Jeff is wild-eyed
() 74
: Where were you taking the money
(losing it) To the truck stop
Where
Main highway
Texaco
Jeff has the information he needs
He slams on the brakes
- Sheriff Boyd swerves to avoid a crash as the to a halt in front of him
- The cruiser skids to a stop
Jeff leaps from the pickup with the pistol in his hand
He rushes toward the cruiser
Sheriff Boyd hops out, levels his service revolver
know where she is
My wife
(ignoring him) Drop the gun
Jeff pitches the gun away and it skitters down an embankment
He raises his hands
You don't understand
She's been kidnapped
understand plenty
Now get down on the ground or 'll shoot
He means it
75
- Earl struggles for breath
The duct tape is still tight around his neck
He strains against the tape binding his limbs
He glances in the side view mirror to see the Sheriff ordering Jeff down on the ground
By wriggling and contorting his wrists, Earl is able to tear one hand free
Then he pulls away the rest of the duct tape from his knees
The tape is still wrapped tightly around    his neck, pinning him to the backrest
Earl claws     at the tape, but it won't come free
Finally, with both     hands, he reaches behind his head and yanks the read rest    from the seat
He reaches into his boot for something
- Jeff is spread-eagled on the ground
Sheriff Boyd calls out to Earl in the cab
He keeps his gun leveled
You there -- in the pickup
You all right
Can you get out
Yeah
Just don't shoot me, officer
He's crazy,  tell you
Well, get out dammit
Officer, please
You gotta listen to me -- (glances down at Jeff) Shut up
(to Earl) 'mon out, sir
It's safe -- Earl sets one foot on the road
The headrest dangles against his back, still taped to his neck
Suddenly Earl whirls, holding a
22 snub-nose  and
The sheriff stumbles away, blood spurting from his shoulder, the gun flying from his hand
Jeff looks up in horror as the sheriff falls
() 76
: Earl comes around the pickup after Jeff, raising the gun to fire
Jeff scrambles to his feet and dives down the embankment
Earl runs to the edge of the embankment
Down below, Jeff is reaching for the automatic pistol the sheriff ordered him to drop
He finds it
too late
Earl is aiming at point-blank range from the top of the embankment
He is already squeezing the trigger when
Earl's chest erupts outward as a bullet passes through his body from behind
Earl staggers and flops down the embankment
He comes to rest near Jeff, blood gurgling from a massive chest wound
Jeff climbs the embankment
The sheriff is lying on the road, critically injured, gun lying nearby and still smoking from the shot that killed Earl
The sheriff is struggling to speak into a remote transmitter strapped to his uniform
(weak) Shots fired
Officer down
Suspect
(
) Help is on the way, Sheriff
Just hang on
have units and an ambulance en route
Jeff bends over the Sheriff and examines his wound with a grimace
He is verging on unconsciousness
Jeff deliberates, torn
There is nothing he can do here
Making up his mind, Jeff runs to the pickup
The hand- held cellular phone has spilled into the road
He scoops it up, jumps behind the wheel and
: - Jeff stands on a ridge overlooking a Texaco truck stop
Behind him, the Dodge Ram pickup lies hidden in a growth of scrub oak and tumbleweeds
Jeff looks overwhelmed by what he sees spread out below
77
'  - It's a giant truck stop
There are hundreds of big rigs parked in rows like silvery sardines
sign towers over the main building:    " $
99
" He looks shaken
How will he ever find Red here
It seems impossible
He descends the bluff to the truck stop
- Jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and reaches the edge of the parking lot
There are trucks everywhere
Diesel
Exhaust fills the air
He reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching the grounds for the markings of Red's 18-wheeler
It's nowhere in sight
high-pitched   from an adjacent truck's sleeping compartment startles Jeff
(
) (muffled) 'mon, baby, give it up
The woman ,
Jeff ignores it, scanning the truck stop
He stiffens
police car is arriving at the truck stop
Staying out of sight, Jeff passes quickly to the rear of a tractor trailer
- Jeff peers out from behind a parked mini-van as trucks emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash
Across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the gas islands
Jeff's eyes narrow
Is that Red's Peterbilt among them
He quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping
The rig's black driver is getting in the cab
Jeff glances to the side, frowns
() 78
: An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily
Jeff looks down, cops to it instantly
His clothes are ripped, caked with blood
He ducks between two parked cars, using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood off his face
He checks to be sure no one is watching
Something catches his eye
- ' highway patrol car with flashing lights is parked near the place where Jeff ditched the pickup
Beside it, a state trooper surveys the truck stop with binoculars
- Jeff's jaw tightens
He glances toward the road, sees two more highway patrol cars cruising the perimeter of the truck stop
Swearing, Jeff turns on his heels and walks away in the opposite direction, shielding his face
- Jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his shoulder nervously
He keeps his head down, moving fast
He scans the truck stop in all directions
The patrol car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering through binoculars
Jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building, passing a row of pay phones
He looks up, stops dead
Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away
Jeff stares
Red is facing away, unaware of his presence
Jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone
He shields his face with the receiver and listens
(on phone) don't know, dammit, he was supposed to be here a half hour ago
There's reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms
() 79
: Red waits, listens
Look, 'm getting out of here
Stay off the airwaves
Bring the girl and meet me at the barn
You got that
He hangs up
Jeff presses the phone against his face and turns away
When he looks up, Red is walking toward his Peterbilt truck, parked in a row of big rigs
Jeff starts to follow, then freezes
Several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning everyone they encounter
Jeff sees Red getting into his truck
The The   and the truck begins pulling out
Jeff whips around
The older vacationing couple are talking to a cop fifty yards away
The husband points toward the pay phones
Jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a rolling farm truck
thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow officers
runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield
He overtakes the truck, cuts across its path
The farmer his
Jeff glances left
Red's tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed
Jeff sprints in front of a moving car
The driver jerks to a halt and , catching the attention of a nearby cop
Jeff quickly turns away, avoiding being seen
Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road
Jeff looks around, panicked
More cops are spreading out on foot
They'll notice him any second
() 80
: Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving postal truck
The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly
Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself
in the path of another huge truck
cop is standing only 20 feet away
Jeff goes underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving wheels
He springs to his feet
Red's Peterbilt is pulling away
Jeff runs for all he's worth
His arms and legs pump furiously
He runs abreast of the truck
and seizes the spare tire mount
-   - Jeff hangs on for dear life
His legs drag over the asphalt
He lets out a cry of pain
The truck is joining the highway, accelerating
Grimacing, Jeff swings his legs over the universal joint as the roadway races past below
The huge  are a blur
Suddenly his grip falters on the grease
His back scrapes the rushing asphalt
Jeff gasps, makes a grab and holds firm
As he hangs on, a station wagon overtakes the Peterbilt in the passing lane
three-year-old boy sits in the rear compartment, staring out at Jeff, a puzzled expression on his face
Jeff stares back
It's an odd moment between the two
The station wagon continues forward and
- The   over a patch of highway that is being graded for paving
81
- The tires kick up a hail storm of loose gravel and dirt, pelting Jeff all over his body
He realizes he can't stay where he is
Grunting with effort, he works his way hand over hand along the underside rigging toward the cab
He seizes the trailer hitch and hoists himself up
- Standing on the coupler, Jeff clutches his ribs and catches his breath
He's in pain
The road whips by below his feet
The truck hits an uneven stretch of road and bounces violently
Jeff grabs the coiled brake line for support
The truck is doing 70 mph, exhaust racketing
Jeff pulls the cell phone from his pocket and dials 911
He holds it tightly to his ear, shouting above the wind
(on phone) Hello
Can you hear me
This is Jeff Taylor
need to talk to the deputy
He strains to hear the reply
The name is Jeffrey Taylor just witnessed your sheriff being shot
Now put someone on, goddammit
He waits
- Red glances in the side mirror at the road behind him as he drives, unaware of Jeff's presence
- Jeff clutches the cell phone to his ear, waiting
He reacts suddenly as the call is put through
Hello
: 82
- Deputy Carver speaks on a phone extension while the sits nearby
It's no good
He's not talking
You better mobilize your boys
The troopers stare back
They look like they have a score to settle
: '  - The truck streaks along the interstate
Sitting on the coupler, Jeff is a picture of despair
: '  - Hours later
The truck races toward the bloated lowering sun, with no sign of slowing down
Jeff lies curled under the windfoil on the roof of the cab
He hugs himself, shivering in the cold draft
: '  - The    in low gear along a sparsely populated two-lane road
neighborhood
- From his hiding place under the windfoil, Jeff peers out into the darkness, unable to figure out where he is
He catches his balance as the truck turns a corner and slows, driving past a tract of undeveloped land, before turning into the driveway of a
- and braking to a halt under the broad overhanging eave of an old dilapidated barn
() 83
: Behind the two-story farm house, a rusted Volkswagen bus and satellite dish hunker in the weeds
newer car, a 1981 Cadillac Deville, is parked to the side
Red kills the engine and climbs out of the cab
As he walks toward the house, a screen
, 9, squirts across the lawn in his pajamas
Daddy, you're home
Red scoops him up
Hey, Deke, you miss me
, 35, comes out of the house in a bathrobe
Deke, get back to bed
said now
(to Red) Warren
thought you were coming back next week
She comes out into the yard
- Jeff flattens against the sleeper
He can see Red greeting his wife, their words carrying faintly across the lawn
Jeff is baffled by this domestic scene
- Arleen reacts with disappointment to something Red's told her
but it's four in the morning
Why can't Al and Billy come some other time
(reasoning) told you, we've got some stuff to take care of
Won't be more than a couple of hours -- promise
Red turns to his son, extends a key
() 84
: Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy
Deke takes the key and sprints for the barn while Red returns to the cab, passing within several feet of Jeff's hiding place
He reaches into the cab, brings out a duffel bag and unzips it
Jeff keeps his breathing shallow, squeezes against the windfoil
Deke, c'mon over here,  got something for you
Deke runs up, breathless
Red holds two hands behind his back
Red and Deke are just six feet from Jeff
Guess which hand
(pointing to right hand) This one
Red opens his right hand
Empty
Nope
Try again
(pointing to left) This hand
Red opens his left
Empty
Nope
(he's been tricked) Dad
(laughing) Okay, okay, 'll give it to you
He opens his hand, revealing Jeff's Swiss Army knife
Cool
() 85
: Deke takes the knife and runs off
Red goes to the rear of the trailer, unlocks it and raises the slatted door
He hops up inside
His   in the metal trailer
We hear him
- Jeff seizes his chance
He crawls out from under the windfoil and hoists himself onto the overhanging eave
The   under his weight
Red sticks his head out of the trailer, puzzled
Deke
Deke, you back there
- Jeff crouches in the shadows
He can see Red poking his head out from the trailer, peering up at the roof
Red shrugs, lets it go
He resumes unloading boxes, tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage
He lugs the items into the barn
- Jeff goes to a second-story window
board has been nailed over the window
He pulls it away, steps into
- and looks around, amazed
Everywhere around him there are stolen goods
Matching luggage sets
a rack of women's coats
a table piled with cameras
a crate filled with car phones
stack of windshields
two sets of golf clubs
three child safety seats
a ten-speed bicycle
() 86
: Several dozen " " license plates are scattered about -- Arkansas, Oregon, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota
As Jeff stares, reeling, there is a  outside
- Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at the barn
He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into
- Al dismounts from the moving truck
Billy climbs out of the Firebird
They are travel-sore, stretching
Red shuts the door behind them
Man, if  never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon
Tell me about it
You get any word on Earl
(shakes head) There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it
Red grunts, unlatches the door to the moving van, lowers a ramp
The three men begin unloading boxes
- Jeff lies on his belly peering through a knothole
' The men unload Jeff and Amy's belongings -- luggage, photography equipment, miscellaneous items
Inside the moving van, the battered Jeep Cherokee is visible, partially covered with a tarp
() 87
: told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah
Nice and clean
So it got a little fucked up -- so what
We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off
There is a  noise,
Red looks over, irritated
Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing
Al sits at a workbench hammering precious stones out of Amy's jewelry
He looks over at Red
Figured 'd get started on the jewelry
Fuck that, you can work on it later
Help us with the girl
- Jeff breathes in sharply, presses his eye against the knothole
- Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of the moving truck
He and Billy slide out a long metal box, similar to a drawer in a morgue
They lift the metal lid, revealing -- The sack is stained and ripped
Red pokes at it
The sack doesn't move
Red shrugs
Must've died from the exhaust
88
- Jeff stares, paralyzed, his universe exploded
Moisture forms in his eyes
- Billy and Al reach into the compartment, start to lift out the sack
'll get some plastic
We'll bury her before it gets light out
Suddenly the sack drives its legs into Al's belly
(startled) Aagh
Al falls backward, drops the sack on the floor
It tears open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape, her wrists and ankles taped
She squirms and kicks wildly, her screams muffled
- We see Jeff's eye in the knothole
It's all we need to see to gauge the effect on him of seeing Amy alive
- Al gets to his feet, furious
Goddamn
Scared me half to death
(chuckles) Gotcha good, huh, Al
Oughta be more careful next time
Shut up
(glaring at Amy) Lemme do her, Red
'll cut her head off right now
(
) (muffled) Warren
You in there
Red reacts
() 89
: Shit, it's my wife
Help me get her in the freezer
(calling out) Just a second, Arleen
Red walks to a corner, moves aside a section of false flooring
He pulls up a hidden trap door, revealing a root cellar
squirms on the hay-strewn floor
Her clothes are ripped, face bruised
She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is visible in the knothole
Their gaze meets
and holds
returns and takes Amy by the legs
Al and Billy lift her by the arms
As they carry her to the root cellar, Red peers into her terrified face
Don't   worry, honey
It's not as bad as   it sounds
It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out
Probably won't even feel it
Amy reacts, writhing even more violently, but she's no match for the three men
Jeff watches helplessly as
The men disappear with Amy into the cellar
We hear a , then a few moments later, the men reappear without her
Red closes the trap door, secures it with a heavy padlock, then slides the panel of false flooring over it
'mon, let's go
They turn, walk toward the door
Red opens it
Arleen is standing there
Al and Billy greet her politely: () 90
: Howdy, Arleen
Hey, Missus
Well finally
Are you coming to breakfast
've been calling you
Sure thing, honey
The barn goes dark as the men leave
The barn door rolls shut
- Jeff quickly climbs down a ladder in the pitch darkness
He crosses the room, bumping into a workbench
He swears, makes his way toward the
- Jeff drops to his hands and knees, feeling for the padlocked trap door
He finds it, speaks in an urgent whisper
Amy
Amy, can you hear me
No reply
Jeff cups his hands, presses his mouth to the floor
(louder) Amy
Still no reply
Jeff swears, glances around the dark room
There is a tool bench across the room
Hang on, baby
They're in the house;  can't use the lights
'm gonna get you out
He goes to   the tool bench, fumbling in the darkness
He knocks over   a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill across the   table
His hands run over an assortment of tools
He   locates a hammer, takes it
Returning to the trap door, Jeff inserts the claw in the padlock and tries to pry it open
The lock won't give
() 91
: He strains, using all his strength
Suddenly the handle snaps
Jeff flies backwards
Fuck
He gets up, goes to the tool bench
His hands feel over and reject an assortment of small tools
He finds a crowbar, returns to the trap door and inserts it into the shackle, twisting with all his might
After several failed attempts, he swears
It's not working
If  make any more noise, they'll hear
Jeff mulls his options
He sets his jaw, exhales
'm going to get you out of there, Amy
He swallows, emotional, clearly torn
love you
(under his breath) Please, God, let her still be alive
-    - Jeff opens the door
weak dome light flickers on
He climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the  radio, but no luck -- the keys are gone
He opens the glove compartment
There are maps, trip logs, truck stop receipts
He rifles through them quickly
Jeff frowns, gets on the floor of the cab and gropes under the driver's seat
His eyes register a discovery
He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol
Jeff studies the base of the grip, clearly unfamiliar with guns
He fumbles with the clip, ejects it
The clip is full of bullets
He snaps the clip back in place

: (under his breath) Fuck you, asshole
: - Jeff climbs out of the window onto the broad overhanging eave
He steps to the edge of the roof and lowers himself onto the Peterbilt cab, then drops to the ground
He looks around
Red's is the only house visible light flickers in the trees a mile away
It could be anything
Jeff moves toward the house
'  -   - Jeff holds the gun ready as he eases open the screen door
The   on its hinges
Jeff steps into
'  -   - Jeff lets the door close silently
There are coming from a distant room
He passes a washing machine, a hamper full of dirty clothes, and moves silently down
toward the voices
sound effects emanate from a room off the hall
Jeff flattens against the wall, peers into the living room
Seated on the floor with his back   to Jeff, Deke is playing Nintendo on a wide-screen   television
Various items are scattered about: stereo    speakers, a jukebox, a brand new Nordic Track
There is    a rifle rack across the room
Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall toward
'  - Red is in the middle of telling a story
Arleen, Billy and Al sit around the table
() 93
: The plates are cleared away
They are drinking beer
So there  am, it's a howling snow storm, 've got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in Denver days ago, and this cop is busting my balls because haven't got chains
Arleen and the men laugh heartily
So what happens but   this big old rooster, damn thing   must've weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out toward that highway   patrolman
Al glances toward the door, stops laughing
Billy and Arleen follow his gaze, go silent
just reaches out with his beak, see, and
Red notices his audience is no longer paying attention
He turns in his chair, sees -- - Standing in the doorway
Aiming the pistol
His clothes caked with blood and dirt
He sways slightly
Nobody else moves
Give me the key
(placating) Now hold on, mister
don't know who you are or what you want -- Give me the fucking key
There is silence
(a beat) Mister -- () 94
: Don't mister me, you sonofabitch
My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn
You don't give me the key, 'll blow your fucking head off
Arleen glances at Red, frightened
(clueless) Warren
What's going on
don't know, honey
Just stay calm -- (to Arleen) Your husband's a kidnapper and a murderer is what's going on
Did you know that about him
Huh
(gestures) Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from
Arleen looks up at Jeff, scared
She starts to open her mouth, when -- (
) Stick 'em up
Jeff turns
Nine-year-old Deke is aiming a rifle at Jeff from the hallway
The rifle looks enormous in his hands
The boy's lip quivers
The room is silent
No one moves
Jeff keeps the pistol aimed at Red
He swallows, speaks slowly: You don't want to do that, kid
Just put the gun down
(firm) Don't listen to him, Deke
Keep the gun on him
Put the gun down
() 95
: (voice quavering) My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time
He showed me in case  needed to protect Mommy when he's away
understand that, Deke
'm not gonna hurt Mommy
But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance 'll still kill your father
He's lying, Deke
He can't get me
Just pull the trigger
No, Deke, don't listen to him
He's wrong
Plug him, boy
Do what  tell you
Deke looks at his father, fights back tears
His finger tightens on the trigger
That's right, boy
Do it
Don't worry about me
Deke whimpers, squeezes the trigger
Deke, no --
Suddenly, Billy bolts from the table
The
The recoil knocks Deke off his feet
The bullet rips into Al's shoulder
Oww -- goddammit, you little shit
Red is out of his chair
Jeff dives first and seizes the rifle
He whirls, aims the pistol at Red
Don't fucking move
Everyone freezes
() 96
: Jeff sidesteps to the window
Billy is running across the yard
Is he headed for the barn
Jeff swears, turns back
Deke
Deke
Get on your feet
Deke rises, tears streaming down his face
It's okay, kid
Go over there, stand next to your mother
Hurry up
Deke obeys
Clutching his shoulder wound, Al glares at the child as he passes
Jeff deliberates
Where the hell was Billy going
He gnaws his lip, decides
Okay
on your feet
Now, everybody
Red, Arleen and Al get to their feet
Deke stays at his mother's side
Jeff aims the pistol at Red, holds the rifle with his other hand
Let's go
Out
He herds them to the door
Arleen looks to Red nervously
Do like he says, Arleen
He's crazy
: - Jeff trains the pistol as his captives stand at the entrance to the barn
He glances around, keeping an eye out for Billy
(to Red) Okay
Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife
This ain't gonna work, boy
() 97
: (jams pistol at him) Do it
Red fishes a key ring out of his pocket and extends it to Arleen
She just stands there
It's okay, Arleen
Take it
She takes the keys
(indicating barn door) Okay, now unlock it
Arleen inserts a key, opens the padlock
Good
Now give me the keys
(turning to Deke) Deke, push the door open
Quickly
Deke looks at his father
Red nods
Deke goes to the door, begins wheeling it open
That's enough, Deke
(gesturing them inside with gun) Let's go
Move it
Jeff herds all four into -- - Jeff leads the group through the barn at gun-point
He glances right and left, wired
The rifle is strapped to his back
He keeps the handgun ready
He peers under the tractor-trailer, looking for any sign of Billy
They reach the trap door
Jeff circles it, constantly keeping an eye on Red and Al
He hands the keys to Deke
Deke,  need you to open this
() 98
: Deke looks at his father
He kneels, unlocks the padlock and heaves open the trap door, revealing a narrow staircase slanting into the cellar
Deke looks down into the darkness and swallows
It's okay, Deke
There's a freezer down there with a woman in it
need you to let her out
Deke descends the steps, frightened
(
) (voice quavering) can't see
Jeff jabs the pistol at Red:    Tell him where the light is
(a beat, to Deke) The switch is on the right
There's a  and the light goes on in the cellar
Deke lets out a yip of fear
(
) Dad
It's all right, son
Just ignore that stuff
Jeff crouches to peer into the cellar
'  - Roots and mildew hang in strings from the ceiling
The light is a bare bulb
There are several distressingly- shaped garbage bags against the wall
His gaze shifts back to Red
(to Deke) Deke
You at the freezer
(
) Yeah
() 99
: Okay
You're almost done
Just open it up, let the woman out
We hear a
She's all tied up with tape
You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you
(
) Uh-huh
Good man
Use that
Make sure you don't hurt her
They wait tensely while Deke works downstairs
(to Red) You better pray she's all right
(
) got her -- (
) Jeff
Amy
(
) 'm almost free
Amy, come up here
Amy climbs the stairs quickly
Scraps of duct tape cling to her wrists
She throws her arm around Jeff
They were going to kill me
know, baby
It's okay
They can't hurt you now
While Amy embraces him, Jeff keeps the gun on Red and the others
He gestures toward the cellar
() 100
: (to Red, Arleen, and Al) Okay
Everybody in the cellar
Nobody moves
Do it
Arleen and Al descend the steps
Red follows, then stops, halfway down
Remember this moment, pretty boy
'Cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run,  will hunt you down and kill you like a dog
Jeff stares back
beat, then: Go to hell
He boots Red in the chest, sending him backward down the steps
He slams the trap door shut and locks the padlock
He looks around, sees a massive tool chest
He tips it onto the trap door -- crash
Then he takes Amy's hand, still keeping an eye out for Billy
Let's get out of here
They run from the barn
- The first rays of sunlight are beginning to poke over the horizon
Jeff wheels the barn door shut and locks it
He sees Amy running toward Red's house
Amy, no
It's not safe -- (turning) But there's a phone inside
We have to call the police
() 101
: One of them's still loose
'mon -- this way
It's too much to explain
Jeff grabs her arm
As they take off running toward the light flickering in the distance
lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn, watching
-   - Jeff and Amy are tiny figures sprinting across the flat terrain, illuminated by the red glow of a rising sun
: -  ( ) The morning sky is lighter now
rickety trailer surrounded by a chicken coop, junked appliances and a clothesline
There's an old utility pickup truck parked in front
Jeff and Amy arrive out of breath
Jeff pounds on the door
Hello
Hello
Anybody home
There's no answer
Jeff puts his shoulder to the door and rams it open
The flimsy door gives way easily
- Jeff enters
The place is ramshackle -- torn vinyl furniture, empty beer bottles scattered about tattered flag hangs on the wall
There's no one around
(shouting) Hello
Anyone home
Amy follows him inside, looks around
Jeff crosses the room, snatches up a phone and dials 911
'mon, c'mon
() 102
: While he waits for an answer, Amy leans the rifle against the wall
She notices a set of car keys hanging by the door
(re: keys) Take it
We may need to get out of here -- (into phone, suddenly) Hello
This is Jeff Taylor
'm reporting an emergency
don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr --  mean, Warren something
No,  don't know his name
(suddenly hearing something) Jeff -- is approaching,   by the second
No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn
Jeffrey Taylor
If you contact the police in -- Amy pulls a curtain aside, reacts to what she sees -- (panicked) Jeff
Suddenly, the  is  -- The   through the wall of the trailer home
dive out of the way
'  - Inside the truck cab, we catch a glimpse of Red behind the wheel, shouting something inaudible
Fragments of debris cling to the grille
103
- The rickety structure spins 360 degrees
Jeff goes flying
somersaults across the room and
Amy slams into a wall
The speeding Peterbilt shears away a section of the trailer home with a horrible  sound
The trailer home is suddenly open to the sky
- Red puts the truck into a hard turn, circling for another run at the devastated trailer
- Jeff struggles to his knees
Amy
Amy is crawling over the debris
Jeff pulls her to her feet
He grabs the rifle and car keys
'mon
They stagger through the gaping hole in the trailer
- Red sees Amy and Jeff flee the trailer and head for the utility pickup
He throws the Peterbilt into a turn
Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder
Jeff keys the ignition
The
Amy whips around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side
Jeff, go
Go

: Jeff turns the key
The
He throws the Ford in gear and floors the gas
The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilt's path
The    of the driveway and joins the road, spewing exhaust
It's an old vehicle that doesn't maneuver well
Jeff mashes the gas pedal
The  , Amy looks back, sees the Peterbilt joining the road
Can't this thing go any faster
the passenger
Amy screams as glass showers the cab
Jeff swerves wildly
What the fuck
He swivels his head right, sees -- kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford on the right-hand shoulder
The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the window
cranks the wheel
Get down
Billy triggers a

yelps as the passenger-side
She whips around, sees -- pulling even with them on Jeff's side
The drive, Al, leers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford -- raises the  and
The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the rear
lets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac
Blood flows in a trickle down his neck
Amy sees it, panicking
Jeff
It's glass
Use the rifle
Amy raises the rifle, thrusts the barrel awkwardly out the window and aims at Billy
She  wildly --
grins as the   past harmlessly
He reloads the , snaps it shut and   --
The  hits the Ford's side-mounted toolbox
The door flies open
Tools scatter on the road

veers away, swearing, as hammers and chisels and power tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path
The front end of the extension ladder comes free from the lumber rack and hinges into his path,  the Sonofabitch
Billy swears and jerks the wheel, steering away
He glances up suddenly, sees Jeff aiming the pistol
The
Billy slams backward against the headrest, hit in the face
There's blood everywhere
The car careens toward the shoulder
The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air and lands with a
Red sees the crash, scowling
He presses the gas and pulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford
Amy sees the Peterbilt advancing
Whipping her head to the other side, she sees Al raising a pistol
Look out
Al jacks the trigger --
a    the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer
The   and whips through the air
Red swears and lets the truck fall back, swearing
Up ahead is a long, curving downgrade
He taps the brakes
There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor
() 107
: Sonofabitch -- He realizes:    The trailer's got no brakes
The Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a - of
It's gaining speed, bearing down on the Ford
Amy turns in the seat, terrified
The truck looms closer
Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor
Hang on
They are flying into a hairy curve
Red struggles to stay in control
Every time he applies the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward
The Peterbilt races into the curve
Red has no choice
He has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether
He hits the brakes
The huge   on the asphalt, tires smoking, cab and trailer folding at right angles
Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab
Flanking the Peterbilt, Al glances to the side and sees the trailer come untethered from the cab
Now the trailer is an unguided missile, weaving drunkenly back and forth across the blacktop
Al tries to swerve away
The trailer streaks toward him
Al  on the , screaming
108
The trailer piles into the Cadillac
There is a huge as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap metal
And just as this is happening
blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with a  of  and taillights
slams against the wheel
Amy is thrown against the dashboard
The Ford is being propelled downhill by the Peterbilt
The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed as they hurtle down the grade
jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and at Red in the truck
off the grille
The   empty
Red hits the brakes, but it's no use
The bumpers are meshed
The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding sideways
Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge
The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge
The big truck glances off a railing
The vehicles suddenly come unlocked
The  plows into the concrete railing with a
The  creams it from behind and caroms away, the length of the bridge before  the opposite railing
109
Jeff grimaces
In front of them, the concrete railing has broken away
Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of the gorge
The Ford's right front tire hangs in the air
Jeff looks at Amy
She looks wildly adrenalated, eyes wide
You all right
Amy looks back at him
She expels a long breath and nods
Jeff forces his upper body through the driver's window and looks over the Ford's roof at the Peterbilt
'  - It's facing them, 50 yards away on the bridge
The engine is dead
from the crumpled radiator
One tire is shredded
There is blood on the broken windshield
sitting in the driver's window
He squints toward the truck, searching for any sign of Red
There is none
(
) Jeff
Yeah
(
) Jeff
can't get out
Jeff drops back into the cab
The dashboard is crushed against Amy's legs
She tries to wriggle free
What is it
(wriggling) It's just
can't get out
What do you mean
() 110
: mean  can't get out
Jeff blinks
He climbs out of the Ford, runs around to Amy's side and yanks the door
It comes open with a of
Behind Jeff on the bridge, a
He whirls
'  - from the smokestacks
Red is behind the wheel
His face is covered with blood
He stares hatefully
With a  of , the Peterbilt lurches forward
He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death urgency
'mon, Amy, push
Amy struggles and struggles to free her legs
Push, goddammit
Amy glances toward the Peterbilt, terrified
creeps toward the Ford
The truck's grille is smashed
One wheel   the asphalt
It gains speed
Jeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs
She winces as the metal cuts into her skin
Jeff strains
(turning, reacting) Jeff

rams the rear of the  --
It jars the pickup farther through broken concrete guardrail
Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact
The Peterbilt's
It's pushing them over the edge
Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces the pickup farther through the broken railing
lurches through the widening gap in the railing
Concrete sails into the canyon
The front tires hang over the void
Jeff strains against the dashboard
It won't give
He whips around, swearing, and leaps from the Ford
(panicked) Jeff
Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side running board, grasping the door handle
Red heaves the door open suddenly
It strikes Jeff's head with a crack
He falls backward to the ground
Red presses the gas, yelling over the
The railing is giving way
He sees Jeff struggling to his feet
You think you can come into my life and fuck with me
Nobody fucks with me
() 112
: He looks down
Jeff is no longer visible
Red frowns
Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff surges into the cab, landing on Red, clawing at his eyes
They grapple in the cab
Red swings an elbow into Jeff's face -- crack
Jeff drives a fist to his jaw
The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck inches forward, ramming the Ford closer to the precipice
Red gets his hands around Jeff's neck as the steering wheel continues to move counter-clockwise
The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely
Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the Ford under its massive weight
Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe
He glances up for a second, reacts, but it's too late
The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the Ford, using the pickup like a ramp
Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened under the Peterbilt's weight
For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang in the air
then the truck is falling
Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab, still flailing at each other, as the truck plunges nose-first into the gorge
Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air
113
The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete railing
The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge
Jeff slams into the windshield
Red lands on top of him
Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield
They grapple
Red grabs Jeff's arm and twists sharply, forcing it at an impossible angle
Their faces are inches apart
You think you can fuck with me
He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack
Blood erupts from Jeff's nose and mouth
Red is about to deliver another blow when
the windshield falls away
The loose items in the cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below
Jeff drops through the windshield opening
He clings to the center support column
His legs dangle over the hood
Red slips through the opening, his hand locking on the steering wheel at the last instant
The windshield sails away into the gorge
The iron
It's beginning to give way under the weight of the truck
The truck slips slightly
Jeff feels the truck shifting
He grabs the windshield wiper blade with his free hand
The blade snaps away
Red is clinging to the steering wheel
He flails at Jeff with his feet, swearing
Jeff is barely out of reach
Jeff looks to the side
There is a grabhandle on the corner of the cab
He reaches with his free hand and seizes the handle
114
The
The truck is wedged against the Ford
As the truck slips, it forces the Ford closer to the edge
Jeff clings to the handle
He reaches for the passenger side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge
gives away once more and -- scales the cab, finding more handholds
He climbs past the passenger door
Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same manner
He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the cab
Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment
Red grabs the door handle
Jeff boots the door release button
The passenger door flies open
Red falls away as the door opens
He's clinging to the open passenger door, suspended over the gorge
Amy breathes in sharply, feeling the Ford move closer to the edge
She struggles to free her legs from the dashboard
Oh God
Jeff
climbs higher
The Peterbilt slips again
Below, Red loses his grip and almost falls
Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of exertion
He runs to the passenger side of the Ford
() 115
: The Ford teeters precariously
Any move could send it over the edge
Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over the void
'mon, Amy, it's all you now
you can do it
With a huge effort, Amy frees herself from the dashboard and reaches for Jeff's outstretched hand just as -- comes free from the rebar
takes hold of Jeff's hand
plummets into the canyon
screams
seems to fall forever
before landing with a huge Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road
Down below, secondary  rock the canyon
Jeff takes Amy in his arms
Don't let me go, Jeff
won't, baby
won't ever let you go
He looks into her eyes
Their lips meet in a kiss and we -- : 116
'  - Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the house
Yellow crime tape holds back onlookers and news reporters
Cops and evidence technicians work the scene criminalist photographs stolen property as it's carried out of the barn
plainclothes   closes a cellphone and walks over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table
They are battered and bandaged
How's the sheriff
Out of surgery
It looks like he's gonna make it
As for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to Protective Services
Jeff nods soberly
We've got
on the dead suspects
Turns out they were all licensed truckers
One of 'em had a rap for check kiting
Otherwise they could've been model citizens
What about the leader
Same thing
His real name's Warren Claney
Three speeding tickets in five years -- apart from that, he's clean as a whistle
Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn
(dazed) How could they do it
How could they treat it like a
business
(shaking his head) don't know
've been doing this 15 years, 've never seen anything like it
() () 117
: (') It was simple, efficient and organized
They stayed on the move, spread it over a dozen states
As long as no witnesses survived, it's an untraceable crime
(looking at them) You were just a couple of the lucky ones
Up ahead, a television news helicopter is landing on the road
cameraman, reporter and producer hurry over
Jeff watches the news crew, a bemused expression
It seems like a million years ago
The  Agent shakes his head, disdainful
(re: media) 'mon -- let's get you folks out of here before things really get hairy
He escorts them to a waiting sedan
As they climb in, Jeff looks back over his shoulder, surveying the scene one last time
He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied news crew arrives, mikes and cameras at the ready, running alongside the departing sedan, shouting questions
Through the rear window, we see Jeff putting his arm around Amy, pulling her close as we hear: Promise me one thing
Name it
Next time
we fly
-  - Over this last line, the sedan drives away, and we and    the bristling crime scene until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in every direction
