When falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall
And when Rome falls -- the World
" Byron : - Germania
The far reaches of the Roman Empire
Winter 180
Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a beautiful tenor voice
Singing
boy's voice
as we hear the haunting song float through dense forests
We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing through the forest
On the road a is herding along three sickly looking cows
His two are with him
His youngest son sits on one of the cows and sings a soft, plaintive song
They become aware of another sound behind them on the road -- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather
The Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the road
They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture of subjugated peoples throughout history
wagon train rumbles past them
Three ornate wagons followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans
His eyes burn with hatred
- Mist momentarily obscures a man's face
Frozen breath
The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome
He is swathed in fur, only his face exposed
He is
He glances up
Do you think he's really dying
The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly
She is slightly older, beautiful and patrician
formidable woman
She is
He's been dying for ten years
think he's really dying this time
beat
Their breath turns instantly to mist
He has to be bled every night now
How do you know that
've been so informed
She arches an eyebrow
If he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us
(a smile) Maybe he just misses us
And the Senators
He wouldn't have summoned them if -- Peace, Commodus
After two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head
beat
The first thing  shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty
The first thing  shall do is have a hot bath
The wagon rumbles to a halt
Voices are heard outside
Commodus leaps out
-  - Three Roman  guard an outpost, a watchtower, on the roadside
Why have we stopped
We're here, sir
(to Soldier #1) Where is my father
#1 He's at the front, sir
Is the battle won
#1 Don't know, sir
They've been gone for eight days
Commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional formed armor of Rome
He moves to a horse as: (to Soldier #1) My sister wants a bath, take her to the camp
(to Soldier #2) Take me to my father
He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian Guard unit
Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them
Commodus rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit
Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon
She glances at the remaining soldiers
Distinctly unpromising
(dry) Civilization at last
Gods preserve us
- The mighty catapults dwarf the humans
Soldiers from the elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul the monstrous machines up a hill
The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, , walks between two of the catapults
He is a striking and intense man in his 30's
Like all the soldiers who surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted
He trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants,  and You would do as well to read the mind of a rhinoceros
These barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch
If didn't hate them so much  would admire them
They have reached the top of the hill
Stunning martial preparations are underway
The catapults join ten others
Archers are taking up position
Brutal "Scorpions" -- devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being loaded
Soldiers are also loading the catapults with enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta pots
Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop
Below them they can see a German encampment
They simply will not surrender
beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position
(quietly) people should know when they are conquered
beat
At the first signal release the catapults
We'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat
General,  don't recommend that
Our cavalry might be caught in the flames
hope not, because 'm going to be leading them
beat as he gazes down at the enemy
Why don't they know they're already dead
- Maximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them
Steam flares from their horses' nostrils
They wait in a thick stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a muddy plain
large wolf -- "The Wolf of Rome" -- waits at Maximus' side
Maximus nods to an archer
The archer lights the tip of an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky
- Quintus waits
The catapults are loaded and waiting
So too the Scorpions
So too the 200 archers of the Felix Regiment
He sees the flaming arrow flying up from below
Now
The mighty catapults are released
The Greek fire pots arc dramatically through the air
moment later soldiers release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through the sky
The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming arrows
- The screaming is almost immediate
Maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down into the German encampment
- The fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere -- seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and ignite the pitch --   -- it is a hellish, napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the twilight
The deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through the German camp -- - Maximus watches the German camp
(to his men) Hold steady
steady
He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming arrows -- panic in the German encampment
Steady
He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain
He quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns to his men: Brothers --  salute you
For Rome
He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the plain
-  - Maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge -- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain toward the Germans -- Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere around them -- The cavalry  into the Germans at full gallop -- It is carnage
The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality -- and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers off horses whenever they can -- Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse and it immediately collapses forward -- Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the battle -- The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the flames silhouetting the fighting -- On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire as he fights for his life -- He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage -- Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for anything -- he is doomed -- Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps through a wall of flame -- "The Wolf of Rome" savages several Germans around Maximus -- giving him the help he needed
The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side
- We see an old man's face, staring down at the battle
The face is weather-beaten, ailing
The roaring flames from the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes
, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse metal brace extends from the back of his saddle
He is strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps
He watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the battle
The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down
Behind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood red
- Maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of the carnage
The Wolf of Rome is at his side
Dead and dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere
Roman surgeons are attending to the wounded
Marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly
Caesar
Maximus, you prove your valor again
Let us hope for the final time here
don't think there's anyone left to fight
There are always people left to fight
Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses of bodies
Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly supporting him as they walk
But this night, at least, Germania is at last defeated
What will you do now, my friend
Should Caesar permit, 'll go home
've been away too long
've forgotten my wife's face and barely know my son
Suddenly, a tethered   they are passing calls out to them: ,
Maximus and Marcus stop
soldier moves quickly to silence the German Prisoner
(to Soldier) Stop
(to Prisoner) You speak our language
You have been in my homeland for twelve years
Of course  speak your language
So did my son, who you murdered
So did my daughter, who you raped
(to Marcus) Come, Caesar
No
Let him speak
(to Prisoner) am Rome, what would you say to me
(points to sunset) You are that sun, Rome, and your time is over
You can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home
Now it is Rome
It will never be Rome
Not as long as one German breathes
The soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner
No
Release him
Give him safe passage
Let him go to his family
The soldier leads the German Prisoner away
Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat
Then: Tell me again, Maximus, why are we here
For the glory of the empire, sire
(quietly) Yes
remember
They continue walking through the mountains of bodies
- Maximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through the dense forest
Slaves follow behind them, leading their horses
Both sides of the road are filled with the men of the Felix Regiment
As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising their swords, paying silent homage
They honor you, Caesar
don't think they're standing for me, Maximus
They honor you
Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian Guard escort
He watches the army honor Maximus with rank envy as he nears
He rides up to Maximus and Marcus
Have  missed it
He leaps from his horse
Have  missed the battle
You've missed the war
We're done here
Commodus embraces him, awkward
Father
Congratulations
shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph
Spare the doves and honor Maximus, he won the battle
Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward
General, Rome salutes you and embrace you as a brother
Highness
They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as: Your Spaniards seem invincible
May the Gods favor the Felix Regiment now and always
(to his father) Here, Father, take my arm
(ignores this) Where's your sister
She's at the camp
She had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield
(smiles) Lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne
Maximus laughs
(smiles) Caesar, you do the lady injustice
It's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off-spring
(he suddenly stops, not feeling well) think
should ride now
Maximus waves for Marcus' horse
It is brought up
Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the saddle
He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle
It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the Emperor of Rome
When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus
So much for the glory of Rome
Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is slowly lead away
Commodus and Maximus watch him go
(neutral) He's dying
beat
Poor old man
(terse) If you'll excuse me, Highness
He turns and stalks away
- We see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents
Hundreds of campfires burn before the tents
- Maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of the dead and dying
Roman surgeons are working feverishly to save lives
Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps quickly cauterized with hot irons
Leeches and bronze cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours
" Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent
Wine amphoras are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward the patients
Mostly, though, they just hold down the writhing patients
Maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort here and there
All the wounded are delighted to see him
He goes to an older soldier, , who has one wooden hand
His other hand is bandaged
What, Gallus, losing your other hand
Aye, General, they're going to make a bronze one for it
Long fingers this time
And the women of your village will crave your touch even more
Ah, then you know the women of my village
Maximus smiles and moves on
He stops at a young soldier, , whose head has been shaved
hole has been bored into his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain
The young soldier is dying
What's your name, son
Valerius, General
The name suits you
Why am  dying
beat
Maximus sits by his cot
He takes Valerius' hand
You're dying because you love Rome, as  do
've never been to Rome
Neither have
Rome for us lives here
(he touches his heart) it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children
It must be glorious, Rome
've only seen pictures
Is it a glorious place
beat
Yes, it's a glorious place
It must be
He smiles
And he is dead
Maximus sits for a moment
He gently closes Valerius' eyes
And Maximus finds that he is weeping
He is not ashamed of the tears
- An immediate swirl of noise
The grand mess tent is crowded with soldiers
They are still filthy with caked- on mud and blood
Wounds are bandaged and tankards are raised in celebration of the victory
Marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors
Currently two Senators,  and , are bowing before him
Hail, Marcus Aurelius
Stand up, Senators
That unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you
We live in supplication to your glory
All the while conspiring with that fat man in Rome
How is the old monster
Senator Gracchus is hale, sire
Still damning me to the four winds
Still eager for your triumphant return to Rome, Caesar
would have silenced him decades ago -- but  just like him too much
Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and Quintus
wound on Maximus' arm has been bound
(to Titus) If you want to stay on,  support you
So do the men
'll ask the Emperor to appoint you in my place
It won't be the Felix Regiment without you
'll return after a season at home
Maybe two
That means after three or four more babies
And you'll be too fat from Vibia's cooking to get on your horse by then
Should the Gods so bless me would be thankful
Commodus perambulates up to them
Hail, warriors
My congratulations
(bowing) Highness
(to Maximus) My old friend, my father tells me you're returning to Spain
Yes
pity
'll need men like you in my army
An awkward glance between the soldiers
This sort of talk is offensively premature
There are larger division that might appeal to you
Even the Praetorian Guard
You've never been to Rome
Imagine arriving as head of the Praetorians
They have really splendid uniforms
(cold) 'm going home
Senators Gaius and Falco join them
(to Maximus) And why not apply for entry to the Senate
war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far
General Maximus, may  present Senators Gaius and Falco
Beware of this Gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is "Republic, Republic, Republic
" Laughter
Have you never considered Rome
No
You've had my ear since we were children
You could be a valuable ally in the Senate
Are you a believer in Republicanism
(laughs) There --  warned you
'm a soldier, not a politician
Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden slit in the tent wall
The eye is particularly drawn to Maximus
If your heart lies with the people, would back you for the Senate
'm sure Gracchus would as well
Not a word about that sodomite bastard
(smiles to Maximus) The august Senator Gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family
He's a damned provocateur
He lives under the antiquated assumption that the Senate should represent the people with vigor
won't tolerate it
His incessant criticism exhausts me
The man can speak for five hours without taking a breath
He serves Rome best when he serves it with honesty
(sharply) Enough
Maximus,  would like to inspect the Felix Regiment at dawn
Please arrange it
can't do that
Excuse me
My men have been fighting for five solid days
They're too busy dying to go on dress parade
beat
Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke
He very quickly gets control
(smiles) Of course, how foolish of me
Some other time
He notes his father being helped out of the tent by several body slaves
Caesar retires early tonight
- Marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor attached
He sees his daughter Lucilla in the corridor, spying in through the slit in the tent wall
He watches her, smiles
If only you had been born a man
She turns to him
He leaves his body slaves and goes to her
Father
What a Caesar you would have made
You're right
think you would have been strong
wonder if you would have been just
would have been what you taught me to be
beat
They stare at each other
He finally smiles
Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber
She smiles and takes his arm
They slowly walk down the tent corridor as: This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it
They disappear into darkness
- Maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets the Rome camp
He stops to observe an unusual sight
Commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body covered in a fine sheen of sweat
He and his six are going through their daily ritual
They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at small trees with swords
It is an eerie, zen-like workout
Commodus' intense concentration is unnerving
Maximus watches for a moment then moves on
He approaches a large network of tents
He enters
'  - Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent
Flickering braziers provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent
Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind
Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire
(bows) Caesar
Marcus holds out a scroll
Read this
never acquired the art, sir
Of course
No matter
In this letter  denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the Emperorship after my death
stunned pause
Maximus stares at him
My son is not a moral man
You have known this since you were young
He cannot rule
Caesar,  am honored but -- For twenty years  have been spilling blood
For twenty years have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered
Since became Caesar  have only had four years without war
Four years of peace in twenty
So perhaps  can be
forgiven
long beat
While  have been fighting, Rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased
did this
And now shall make it right
Sire, you brought the light of the Gods to barbarian darkness
You brought civilization and justice to the farthest -- (fierce) have brought the sword -- nothing more
Rome is far away and we shouldn't be here
What matter is it to the Gods if we subdue one more tribe of Parthians or Gauls
What matter is it to Rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash
beat
Marcus sits
He doesn't look at Maximus
pause
Winter, Maximus
It's winter now
beat
There was a dream that was Rome can only whisper of it now
Anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes
It's so
fragile
The true glory of Rome is in a very fragile idea
Imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen
Where every free man has a voice
That was the dream
And fear it will not survive the winter
He holds out a hand to Maximus
Maximus takes his hand, deeply moved, kneeling
Let's just whisper here, you and
Yes, Caesar
If the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice
The voice  took from them
That all the Caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest
And now that  am dying  am going to give them that voice again
You're not dying
am, Maximus
It's strange find as  near the end  think little of the waning moments around me
instead  think much of the past
and of the future
How will the world speak my name in years to come
Will  be known as the philosopher
The warrior
The tyrant
Or will there be a more golden sounding to my name
Will be the Emperor who gave Rome back her freedom
beat
Before  die  will give the people this final gift
will give them the Senate reborn
The voice of the people empowered again, as it was always meant to be
It is my design that they will elect the next Emperor
And  would put forward your name with my backing
Caesar, you do me honor -- but your son has pride of place for succession
You are the son  should have had
Although  fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did Commodus
We're a cursed bloodline
We have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it
We can no longer even imagine a life without it
beat
Look at me, son
Maximus looks at him
Son
know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of Rome
know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an Empire
But
a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least think about what he has said tonight
shall, Caesar
beat
'll keep this letter to myself hope that with the sunrise you will agree
And embrace me as a father
Maximus nods and rises
He begins to go
Stops
You have always been my father
He goes
- Maximus emerges from Marcus' tent into a long tent corridor, deep in thought
' He always favored you
He turns
Lucilla is waiting
She glides to him
Even over his son
(turning away) That's not true
Maximus, stop
(he stops) Let me see your face
He turns to her
You've been crying
lost too many men
What does my father intend
He turns and walks
She walks with him
don't know
You're lying
could tell when you were lying even when we were children
You hate it
never acquired your comfort with it
True
But then you never had to
Maximus, stop
(he stops again) Is it really so terrible seeing me again
No
'm sorry
'm tired from the battle
And you are hurt to see my father dying
beat
He will announce Commodus' succession
That's why he summoned us
Will you serve my brother as you served his father
will always serve the ideals of Rome
beat
Do you know  still remember you in my prayers
Oh yes,  pray
Ever since that day you saved me from drowning off Capri
Do you remember
Yes
Commodus was so angry that a mere peasant -- a Spaniard no less -- touched the royal person, do you remember his anger
Yes
Mark this, Maximus:  that is the man who will be Emperor
beat
May  be permitted to go, Highness
She smiles sadly
There was a time when you didn't call me "Highness
" And there was a time when you were just a little girl drowning in the sea
All that was a different life
(quietly) Very different
wonder if it was better
It was more honest
moment between them
We sense there is much to be said, much that could be said
Finally: thank you for your prayers
He goes
She watches him walk away
'  - Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent
He faces six small figures that represent his dead ancestors
Ancestors, true bloodline,  ask you for your guidance
Bring me your solace and your wisdom
Blessed Mother, come to me in my dreams with the Gods' desire for my future
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and my son with a ready sword
Keep them safe until my return
Whisper to them in their sleep that  live only to hold them again and all else is dust and air
Ancestors, true bloodline,  honor you and will try to live with the dignity you have taught me
He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows out the candles around them
'  - Commodus' eyes are red with weeping
He sits, head down, at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father
(quietly) search the faces of the Gods for ways to please you
to make you proud
and  can never do it
One kind word -- one full hug where you pressed me to your chest and held me tight -- would have been like the sun on my heart for a thousand years
What is it in me you hate so much
My eyes are your eyes
My hands are your hands
All  have ever wanted was to live up to you
Caesar
Father
He stands
We see that he is holding the scroll denoting Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the Senate
Commodus cannot control his tears
Why does Maximus deserve what could never have
-- Why do you love his eyes over mine
--  would butcher the whole world -- if you would only love me
Commodus weeps
'  - Quintus is waking Maximus -- General -- Maximus -- Quintus --
The Emperor needs you
It's urgent
Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with Quintus
- Dead of night
Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent
What is it
Is he ill
don't know
They continue on toward Marcus' tent
'  - Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams to a halt
Stunned
Commodus stands before him
Lucilla stands in a corner of the tent, head down
And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed
Maximus stares at Marcus
Lament with me, brother, our great father is dead
want -- Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus
He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead
ritual farewell
moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands
He turns very, very slowly to Commodus
General, the Gods' have taken the great man and left me alone
My first desire as Emperor is that you take my hand in friendship
need you at my side, Maximus, at this moment above all others
Stand with me
Maximus glares at him: How did he die
Commodus does not respond
How did he die
The surgeons say it was his breath that gave out
Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes
Take my hand, Maximus
only offer it once
beat
Maximus turns back to Marcus
How will the world speak your name now, old man
Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out
silent beat
Then Commodus nods to Quintus
Quintus goes
Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an enigmatic tornado of complex emotions
Then: Hail, Caesar
'  - Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his fists clenched, praying
Quintus and four Praetorian  suddenly burst in -- the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords at his throat -- What --
(ashamed) Please don't fight, Maximus -- Quintus -- Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and slowly removes his seal of office
'm sorry, General, Caesar has spoken
They pull Maximus out -- '  -   - Five horses are waiting
Quintus, what --
(anguish) have no choice -- They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty Praetorians who gallop past
Maximus knows immediately what this means
(suddenly) My family
beat
What about my family, Quintus
(quietly) They will greet you in the afterlife
Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him -- slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him unconscious
(quietly, to assassins) Take him as far as the sunrise and then kill him
- The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road
He sits slumped in his saddle, drained
#1 All right, this is far enough
The three other assassins climb from their horses
Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse
He falls to the ground hard
#1 You two take him down there where no one will find him
#3 Come on, General
Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely forested hill along the road
Maximus' hands are still bound in front of him
He seems totally lacking in any resistance
-    - Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor
The armor of men who have never seen real battle
Have you ever done this before
#3 What
Killed a man with a sword
#3 Not like this, exactly
this is good, you can stop
They stop
They are far down the hill, out of sight of the road
It can be very messy -- you could get blood all over your armor
You don't want to hack me up now
You want one clean stroke
#3 Would you kneel, General
Maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling
Assassin #3 stands over him as: One good stroke -- you do know where, don't you
#4 Be quiet
If you miss the spot there'll be blood everywhere
Quite a spray
#3 All right, where
Here -- you don't want to hit the vein on the neck -- Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of his neck
Put the point of your sword here
you want one, good blow right at this spot -- Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the spot on Maximus' neck
grave mistake
Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 --  up -- his hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency -- decapitating both assassins -- - On the road above, the other two Assassins are on their horses, waiting
They hear a quick yelp from below
And then nothing
Assassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the execution
Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the hill
-    - Assassin #2 canters down the hillside
He senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his sword -- too late -- Maximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air -- and into Assassin #2
- Assassin #1 waits on his horse
He hears the commotion below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to the road
He stands with a sword
Assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares -- Assassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant -- both slashing brutally -- Assassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus
He stops
He looks down
wound in his stomach
He falls off his horse
Dead
Maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side
He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses
- Maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning speed, leading four horses behind him
The gash in his side bleeding
- gloomy day
Emperor Commodus stands before the assembled Felix Regiment
The soldiers are already uneasy
They note Quintus standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office
Where is Maximus
Even as the Gods curse this dark day with clouds, so too does the sun begin to shine forth on a promised tomorrow
Even as we mourn the passing of our father, so too do we celebrate the coming of a bright, new age for Rome
At my side, brothers, you shall pull fresh glories from the heavens
At my side, brothers, you shall know the adoration of the Gods
Doubly-dark is this day because my friend, your noble commander Maximus Meridas, has been called to Rome to deal with urgent matters of state
Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged from surgery
They know this cannot be true
Until his promised return appointed Quintus Domitian to serve in his stead
salute you, Legionnaires
(raising his sword) Hail, Caesar
The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure
Hail, Caesar
Commodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly disbands, muttering to one another in confusion
Titus and Gallus go to Quintus
Quintus, what is --
(firmly) Don't speak of it
Never speak of it
He stalks off
Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him follow after Commodus
'  - Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent
She looks around
She gently touches his Lorica Segmentata
Her fingertips move along the contours of his armor
She tries to retain her neutral demeanor
She notes his "ancestors" on the small alter
- Maximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse
He leads only two horses now
- Maximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure
We see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious house nestled amid gently rolling hills
Maximus' eight-year-old  is in a paddock playing with his pony
He stops, sees something
Over a hill, he can just glimpse a battle flag, approaching
He screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls: ' '
Maximus'  emerges from the house, drying her hands on a cloth and smiles
Maximus' Son races toward the flag
He can just see the soldiers beginning to appear over the hill
Not a Roman Legion at all
Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill
Maximus' Son stops, confused
- Maximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse now
The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats its neck
It can't make it
The horse collapses and Maximus falls
He immediately leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the hill
- Maximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a frenzy
His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side of his horse
He rears the horse to a stop for a moment
Over a hill he can see thick black smoke rising
He spurs the horse and gallops over the hill
- And his worst nightmares are realized
His home and his vineyards have been destroyed
The earth has been scorched and his house is still smoldering
He rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse
He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris of his house, fearing what he knows he will find
He sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the ruins
He sees a Praetorian battle flag
He continues on, his wound bleeding more with every tortured step
He finally stops
He stares up
His wife and his son have been crucified and burnt
They are nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes
Maximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats his face in the ashes of his dead world
He sinks into unconsciousness, praying for death
- An unusual jingling sound is heard
Maximus appears to be dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester
The source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the feet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling around him
hand touches his sandals
Rich sandals
Another touches his tunic
Good cloth
Suddenly Maximus groans
The hands stop
He's alive bit of quick language in an unknown tongue
Then the hands grab Maximus and drag him away
- Maximus' eyes slowly open -- Inches away from his face -- a lion roars -- Maximus lurches back
He looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon
Three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape
Exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the wagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe
dozen slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and other cargo
Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal babel of foreign tongues
And someone is looking at him
, a striking African, is gazing at him impassively as he chews something
Juba is also chained
(weakly) Am  in Hades
Yes
Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and moves to Maximus
For your wound
Maximus stares at him
(nods) For your wound
Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side
Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound -- Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into the wound gently as: If you die in the wagons they feed you to the lions
The lions are worth more than we are
think we are worth more than the zebras though
So they don't feed us to them
Maximus stares at him
Juba looks down at him with the barest hint of a smile
'm not sure about the giraffe
- The heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever known
Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand
The provincial market is bustling like the proverbial anthill
Slave traders and dealers and merchants move around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically
Maximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display, poked and prodded and fondled
Their sings out their praises to any passers
The crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival of
Proximo is a large man of immense appetites
He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate
Two slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with switches
Proximo, my old friend, see what have for you today --
Proximo  a fist into the Slave Trader's face
The Slave Trader sails back
Those giraffes you sold me won't mate
All they do is run around not mating The Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious
will make it up to you, Master
It's bargain day for you
Look, look, look --  have two lions and a panther -- hear how they roar for you
"Bring me home, Proximo
" Proximo examines the animals
How much for the lot
For you -- 8,000 sesterces
For me -- 6,000 sesterces and  want to see their balls first
And you throw in those two slaves
(moves to Maximus) What about this one
Look at the arms
Proximo moves to Maximus
The Slave Trader forces open Maximus' mouth
Good teeth -- Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body
Where did you get those scars
Maximus doesn't respond
Are you a soldier
Maximus doesn't respond
Do you speak
-- (he roars back to a slave) (back to Maximus) He's dying
1,000 sesterces
My ass
(moves to Juba) You throw in this one and we'll make it 7,000 sesterces for the whole lot
have to eat, Master
He's my finest,  couldn't let him go as part of the lot for less than 9,000 total
(back to Maximus) tell you this one is prime
He's a Spaniard and killed fourteen of my men before he could be subdued
Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars again
The scars, and something he senses in Maximus' eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it
(to trader) All right, let's see
The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains
Maximus has no idea what's going on
In the center of the market place, a veritable  of a man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand
He is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot chain shackled to his ankle
think metal helmet is riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair emerging
His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in the helmet
The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and shoves him toward the Giant
The Giant stands
He towers over Maximus
The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground
Maximus pulls himself up
The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils -- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls
Maximus pulls himself up
The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times -- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he falls
Maximus pulls himself up
The Giant is about to attack again -- (to Slave Trader) That's enough
His colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away from Maximus
The Giant quietly sits back on his stool
Proximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to the Slave Trader
'll give you 500 sesterces
No -- no -- 1,000
(laughs) Come, don't quibble with your old friend
'll take the lions, the panther, the Numidian and this one for 7,000
And 'll buy you the best whore in the town for two nights
She's an enormous mountain of flesh who craves a stern hand
How could  say no to my old friend Proximo
'  - Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten other slaves, including a very scared and reedy
Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including several lions
The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken through an imposing set of gates to
'  -  - An open compound in Proximo's school
On one side of the compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of every description -- including Proximo's two hapless giraffes
Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves are unloaded
Heavily armed guards supervise everything
But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them
Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a cage
,
He kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the cage
Proximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a seedy prison
The fading grandeur of the decaying battlements and the sweeping North African architecture only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place
And if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession -- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound
Twenty  are working out in the compound -- hacking at practice dummies and sparring
The many heavily armed guards oversee everything
The gladiators stop working out as they see the new slaves enter
They eye their potential new opponents warily
One huge, glowering gladiator --  -- watches with particular interest
His eye is quickly drawn to the most obvious athlete:  Juba
The new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of water on them, cleaning them
Meanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak
slave brings him wine as he give his "welcoming speech" to the new slaves: Slaves
am Proximo, trainer of gladiators
You live and die at my pleasure
Fight well and you will live
Fight poorly and you will die
It is better to live
Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime coats and stings their wet bodies
Here you will be trained in the art of combat
Here you will be given the tools to survive
Please my patrons in the arena and all the gifts of the world will be showered upon you
Imagine riches beyond your paltry dreams of riches
Imagine fame beyond your rude understanding of the word
All this can belong to the select few who prove their worth in the arena
Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off the lime
If
on the other hand
you disappoint me
you will be dismembered and fed to my jackals limb by limb
He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions
And my jackals are always hungry
He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators toward their cells
'  - '  - Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell
The cell door faces the open compound
Across the compound they can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star" gladiators such as Vibius
They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall
Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon
Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not touched them
Have you killed a man before
Maximus does not respond
You should eat
You'll need your strength tomorrow
Maximus does not respond
've never killed a man
But think you have
Maximus does not respond
almost killed once
The Romans destroyed my village
was with a hunting party and when we returned
would have killed every Roman in the world
long beat
If you don't eat you will die
Maximus does not respond
beat
In the village  come from there was a man once
He went fishing one day and his boat was attacked by crocodiles
One of them ate his leg
He pulled himself to the shore and a lion attacked him
It ate one of his arms
He dragged himself through the desert on the way home and a scorpion stung his eye
So he only had one eye
When he reached the village  sat with him
said, "You have lost a leg, an arm and one eye
You must have a mighty will to live
"  He said, "No, Lord, it's just better than the alternative
" Maximus finally looks at him
Life is a gift from our fathers to us
Who are you to give it up for lack of lifting a spoon
Maximus does not respond
'  -  - Maximus and Juba are being observed
Proximo stands in the shadows of the compound and watches intently
-   - Blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back
But the blood is too rich, too red
The oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the crowded streets of the town
Hanging above the street is dyed wool drying in the sun
Vermilion and crimson dyes drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across the gladiators
Maximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the back of the wagon
Also the frightened Scribe
Proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon
Proximo has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping dyes
They pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's stable
Meanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping, chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him: know nothing of armaments and warfare
'm a scribe --  write down words
can write down seven languages -- Be still
don't -- how do you hold the sword
've never held a sword
You point the sharp end at your opponent and you shove it in his guts
can't --  -- He suddenly vomits
(calling to Proximo) Proximo
You insult me with this carrion
Chain him to someone else
(calling back) Don't worry, noble Vibius, he won't be bothering you for long
The Scribe begins to weep
The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators
Occasionally throwing trash at them
pack of children run alongside the wagon, chanting: Dead guts
Dead guts
Dead guts
Maximus watches the children for a moment and then another sight draws his attention
Over some buildings he can see vultures circling in the distance
-  - In the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting
Proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk
"  He gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face
Some of you say you can't fight, you won't fight
They all say that
But one day you will pick up a sword and thrust it into another man
And the crowd will cheer you and love you
And you will love them for it
On that day
you will be a gladiator
He stops at Maximus
In this life, we all die
All we can choose is how we die
And how we are remembered
Be remembered proudly
Drums are heard from the arena
Proximo nods to a waiting blacksmith
The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a chain about four feet long
The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe
No
(he points to Juba) give the Spaniard to him
Give the Scribe to Vibius
Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering Scribe
Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba together and then strides off
(to Maximus) Are we going to fight each other
- Proximo sits in a box with several other They drink wine and eat constantly perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets
The arena is only sparsely attended this day
Make it 600 sesterces for each decapitation
#1 How many strokes
Two
#1 For the great Vibius, one stroke
Done
400 sesterces for two strokes
In the arena: Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams
Maximus and Juba are chained together
Some of the small crowd cheers for Vibius
He acknowledges the cheers
He is chained to the weeping Scribe
In the box: Trainer #1 laughs
#1 (re: Vibius) Who's he with
Greek Scribe
#1 'll raise the wager
(smiles) Give me odds, friend
In the arena: From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very scary Andabatae thunder into the arena
Some of the crowd cheers
The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and the battle is on
Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo surely intended
Vibius is now free to fight alone, swinging the chain as an additional weapon
Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing Juba to pull him along -- Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus and Juba closely
Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced
He strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing -- his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword for the kill -- And Maximus strikes
With a sudden roar he  into action -- he swings past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after him as he fights -- It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers a sword and they fight together
In the box: Proximo watches, smiles
gladiator is born
-  - , an imposing, moral and corpulent man in his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with Senator Gaius
And  , the handsome Head of the Roman City Guard
Their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets of Rome
The cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban center is everywhere around them
We have plague in the Hebrew Quarter and it is spreading
we have looting at the granaries
we have so much filth in the Tiber that the water is undrinkable
we have Praetorian Guard units that are demanding protection payments from the merchants at the exchange -- My City Guard units have tried to curtail these excesses but no constabulary can police the entire city
And the Praetorians outnumber us two to one
Rome dies as the Emperor plays at beneficence
At least Nero gave us music
Do you think he'll listen to us
It is his duty to hear the will of the Senate
Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs
Not to mention the damn traffic
-   - Emperor Commodus is standing before a group of male children and their tutors in his throne room
The throne room is still very much the province of his father
Manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk
large bust of Marcus Aurelius is in one corner
Lucilla and Senator Falco are present
So too Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus
well-rehearsed child presents Commodus with a laurel wreath
We honor Caesar with the laurel to show our love and appreciation for his benevolence
Caesar is honored to accept your tribute, Citizen Scholar
The child smiles and moves back to his fellows
(to all) It is the most sacred duty of the Emperor to oversee the education of the young
If  could leave no other legacy than the scholarship of all children my life would be blessed
Tutors, you hold the future of Rome in your hands
Teach them well so that they will bring honor to the Empire
salute you
Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor
The tutors bow in response and herd the children out
Look at them, Senators
my truest gift to Rome
Darling children, to be sure, now if may proceed
(sighs) Very well
Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at Marcus' scrolls as: Caesar, your presence in Rome is an invaluable opportunity to begin correcting some of the ills that have beset the city since your father went to the wars
We would like to -- Peace, good Gracchus, peace
Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off the desk to the floor, one by one, as: My beloved father was a careless shepherd to his flock
shall be a good father to my children
shall remain in Rome and show them how they are loved
With respect, sire, the people don't need love -- they need law
The Senate has prepared a series of protocols to begin addressing the corruption in the city -- (Gaius hands him a scroll) -- starting with basic sanitation in the Hebrew Quarter
If Caesar could study this and -- You see that's the very problem, isn't it, my old, old friend
My father spent all his time at study
At books and learning and philosophy
As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk, tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave
The chair is whisked away
He spent his twilight hours reading scrolls from the Senate
All the while, the people were forgotten
The Senate is the people
doubt many of the people eat so well as you do, Senator Gracchus
As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is whisked away
Lucilla watches this closely
doubt many of the people have such splendid armor, Captain Marcellus
Or such fine mistresses, Senator Gaius
No
only their true father knows what the people need
shall show them they are loved
shall hold them to my bosom and embrace them tightly -- Have you ever embraced someone dying of plague, sire
Commodus stops
Looks at him
lethal moment
No
But if you interrupt me one more time  assure you that you shall
will emulate the immortal Caesars of the past
will give the people what they truly want
Starting this day  will draw all of Rome to the Colosseum
will give them bread
And they will want nothing more
Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus
You want to hold games
Not just any games, Senator series of games that will make the Gods envious and leave my children happy
will subsidize the arena from this day forth -- and  will culminate this celebration in a great spectacle the likes of which the world has never seen
great spectacle to honor my father
Magnificent, unending weeks of festivity all in the name of Marcus Aurelius
beat
If  may, Caesar
how are you going to pay for this
That is not your concern
Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius
Respectfully, sire, taxation and import duties are the exclusive province of the Senate -- Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral violence that everyone is shocked -- -- -- -- He snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away
Senator Falco quickly follows
dreadful silence
Then: Gentlemen, in the future do not concern my brother with these matters
Come to me
She sweeps out
beat
Games
He wants to hold games
It's madness
No
it's not
beat
He knows who Rome is
Rome is the mob
He will conjure magic for them and they will be distracted
And he will takes their lives
And he will take their freedom
And still they will roar
The beating heart of Rome isn't the marble of the Senate
It's the sand of the Colosseum
He will give them death
And they will love him for it
-  -  - Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the arena
We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels
Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past gladiators who line the walls
Some are wounded, some are being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked, some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers
We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus as: (quickly) 've wagered on you against the Celts -- ignore the others and go for them -- there are two axe-and- net and two long spear
Now the Celts aren't used to the sun so you have the advantage there
The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the arena
And keep them moving, their lungs aren't strong, ground the spears as soon as you can and then go for the ax-men
If you get all four there's an extra bonus so don't be distracted by the Spartans
Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation, Maximus strides into the arena
- We continue with Maximus as he strides into the roaring arena
We finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a beard -- battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and dying gladiators crowd the arena -- We stay with Maximus as he wades through his opponents, fighting them heroically, slashing through them without stopping -- The large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "Spaniard
Spaniard
Spaniard
" We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull up and away -- Taking in the roaring arena and the hero
'  -  - large mess area has been set up
The tables around the compound are crowded with gladiators
Guards everywhere
Maximus and Juba enter
Move to get food
All conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators watch them
Silence
Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to a large table
Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators
There are no places for Maximus and Juba
Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their bench
Maximus and Juba sit
Vibius remains standing
He begins to pound on the table with his fist
Soon all the gladiators are pounding on their tables
It is a cacophonous din honoring Maximus
'  - '  - Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound, sipping wine
Various gladiators can be seen working out below
guard brings Maximus
Proximo nods for the guard to leave
(holding up a plate) Butterfly
The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings still moving slightly
Maximus shakes his head
Proximo pops one into his mouth
He chews as he looks at Maximus
Perhaps you'd like a woman
Maximus shakes his head
Boy
Maximus shakes his head
beat
Gold
Maximus shakes his head
Well,  have nothing left to offer you
man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me
Personally, 'd grab them all and then grab some more because the Gods are fanciful and take us at their whim
Does the Spaniard have any needs
Maximus shakes his head
beat
Proximo studies him
You fight like a soldier
You have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns
You eye the world around you like an enemy
What is your name, Roman soldier
Gladiator
beat
And nothing more
Nothing more
beat
Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following: In two days we leave for Rome
Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo
He is transfixed, his eyes burning
Ah
so it's Rome you want
Well you shall have her, Gladiator
The new Emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle
If you do well  shall become very, very rich
If you do well enough  shall set you free
Is it freedom you want
beat
Maximus shakes his head
(quietly) Not even that
(barely controlled) The Emperor -- will he be there
Oh yes
He's apparently quite mad about the games
Spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again
But what is good for you, Gladiator
Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor
As a gladiator
Yes
One doesn't
beat
Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing
Except
If one has proven oneself in battle
If at the end of the games you are the final man standing -- the Emperor will present you with a small wooden sword
The sword is your freedom
He give it personally
He did to me
(Maximus is surprised at this) Our great father Marcus Aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder
You knew Marcus
didn't know him
He touched me on the shoulder
Just once
But that was enough
beat
All right, Gladiator
We shall go to Rome together and have bloody adventures
The Great Whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop
That is Rome

-   - Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators
In the distance, Rome
- '  - Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head
Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic
All my desires are splitting my head to pieces -- there's so much  want to do -- but all my efforts to show my children they are loved go unappreciated by those dragons in the Senate -- (mixing tonic) Quiet, brother
Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the drink from a vial secreted in her robe
Leave the Senate to me
Don't trouble yourself
All  want is to be a good father to my people
Why don't they understand that
She goes to him
Shhh
The tonic will help
She takes a sip and then hands it to him
Yes, just drink this down
She sits on the edge of the bed
He drinks as: must take a firmer hand with them
They must know their father can be firm
As our father was firm with us
Our father lost his way
His mistake was believing the old songs of the "Republic
"  We know better
So let the Senate talk
They have no real power
Yes
yes
you always know the way
You were always so wise in these matters
(he takes her hand) You know if  didn't have my duty to Rome  think  should be an artist
should go away and paint pictures of the sea and leave all the politics to you
beat
He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed
Will you stay with me
(smiles gently) Still afraid of the dark, brother
Still
Always
beat
My dreams would terrify the world
beat
'll stay with you until you are asleep
(falling asleep) And after
just sit with me
Keep me safe
He is asleep
She watches him for a moment and then rises
She goes
-  - Lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows out candles as she goes
She finally arrives at her own chamber and enters
- '  - Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are waiting
He's asleep
Be quick
We've taking a sounding, the Senate is with us
Good
But we are only words
We are air
We need steel
The City Guard is faithful to the Republic
But we don't stand a chance against the Praetorians
Can they be bought
They are zealots -- totally committed to your brother
Well, can they at least be rented for a day
doubt it
He pays them exorbitant salaries and lets them loot and extort as they see fit
The city belongs to them
And they've started arresting scholars now
Anyone who dares speak out -- even satirists and chroniclers
And mathematicians and Christians
All to fill the arena
And what pays for it
These games are costing a fortune and yet we have no new taxes
The future
The future pays for it
beat
She looks at them
He's started selling the grain reserves
No
That can't be true
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain
The people will be starving in two years
hope they are enjoying the spectacles because soon enough they will be dead because of them
Rome must know this
And who will tell them
You, Marcellus
You, Senator Gaius
Will you make a speech on the Senate floor denouncing my brother
And then see your family in the Colosseum
What town-crier would dare
long beat
He must die
beat as her words sink in
The Praetorians would only seize control themselves
No -- cut off the head and the snake cannot strike
Lucilla, Gaius is right
Until the City Guard can neutralize the Praetorians we can accomplish nothing
And  haven't enough men
What about the army
No Roman army has entered the capital in a hundred years
So we do nothing
door opens, a voice
' Mother
An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy
He is , Lucilla's son
heard voices
(going to him) It's all right, darling, you -- Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus: (running to Gracchus) Senator
What did you bring me
He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls something from his robe
For you prince Lucius
a sea monster
Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea serpent
Off the coast of Achaea they grow twenty times this size, with snapping teeth to devour any nasty Praetorians they come across
now, where is Achaea
Below Macedonia
Show me on the map
Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea
We sense this is an old game between them
Lucius, you go in now, 'll be in shortly
(to Gracchus) Thank you, Senator Mountain
You're welcome, Prince Anthill
Lucius goes
Lucilla shuts the door after him
moment
She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes
What are you going to do
Gracchus goes to her, holds her
Peace child
One dark night the Gods will light our path
They will give us the voice we need
Have faith in that
Have faith

-   - Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart
He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass
But the images are not what he expected
Alongside the undeniable glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius spoke of are readily apparent
Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent architecture of the city -- he sees starving children begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of sophistication and depravity, of civilization and corruption
He sits back in the cart, deep in thought
Vibius looks at him
Not what you expected
No
Rome is nothing but a slaughter house
And we are the meat
'  - The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman compound
Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon drives in
'  -  - Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's Moroccan school but much more impressive
fountain with an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the courtyard
The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the long journey
Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the statue
He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe of Mars
Tradition
He watches over us
Juba steps up and kisses the toe
(to Maximus) Oh go on, it won't kill you
Maximus kisses the toe as well
(calling to them) Stop that
You'll get some monstrous disease and then you'll be worth nothing to me
Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one side of the courtyard
'  -  - Later
Maximus and Juba again share a cell
It is more comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus' new status as one of the "stars
"   high, barred window on one wall opens to the city
Another barred window is directly over them, twenty feet above
Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out
And sees at last
The Colosseum
It is a breathtaking sight
Monolithic Albert Speer-like columns of light shine up from the Colosseum
It seems to illuminate the whole city and the heavens above
Maximus drops back to the floor
Do you think it will be much different
Here in Rome
Bigger arena
Same killing
beat
Are you scared for tomorrow
No
beat
Me too
beat
never though it would be so easy to kill
beat
So you're finally home
This isn't my home
For all Romans
this is home
beat
(quietly) Among my people we honor the soil of our home
Our ancestors are in that soil
All their dreams live there
will never see my home again
The soil is dead and no one honors them, so the dreams die
beat
Perhaps one day you'll return
Juba looks at him
How can  go back
am not what was
When a man kills for no reason, he has lost himself
long beat
Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing haunting lament in his native tongue
- flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy mounting
At this point we see practically nothing of the inside of the Colosseum: Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena
They are on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that provide shade below
Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside of the Colosseum
They sell everything from food to magic elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs
They immediately start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their products
Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets
They have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup
Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the pickpockets
We see whole families with picnic lunches
Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred cages
In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and contortionists
Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they feign indifference to the hooting mob
Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some order
Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly
Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a slave cart
Maximus watches everything as the slave cart disappears into the Colosseum
-     - The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself
Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a long ramp and past countless animal cages
Gamblers circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for the best odds and the best matches
Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm
Numerous cells line the walls
Racks and racks of weaponry and armor
And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy machinery of the spectacles above
Huge "elevator" platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are manned by teams of sweating slaves
-   - Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their holding cells
These cells are right at the edge of the arena
Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the action
Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out
He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does see transfixes him
band of Christians are huddled together
An eerie silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the Christians
Maximus watches them
One little girl peels past her mother's arm
She sees Maximus
She smiles
Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus -- they roar into the arena -- We do not see the carnage
We watch Maximus' face as we hear the sounds of the slaughter
And the sound of the roaring crowd
Maximus finally cannot watch
He drops his head
- '  - Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the Colosseum's orator and majordomo,
They are haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena itself
Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and wagers and odds
Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing bouts
The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the Christians can clearly be heard
and the Emperor will have no more animal battles today -- Upset roars from some of the trainers
#1 You promised me a bear match, Cassius
#2 have ten damned gorillas
You said gorillas yesterday
Talk to the man in the imperial box
Who has the next slot
(he checks the boards) -- Lentulus, Gideon, Trebonius and Proximo -- (to Proximo) -- Nice to have you back, you piratical bastard -- now listen, the Emperor wants the Carthage spectacle
The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance -- No -- have pity, Cassius --
#3 My men are too good for --
You give us the Carthage match or lose your spot on the rotation -- but don't worry -- gold is flowing from the Emperor's fingers
#3 It'll cost you -- won't do it for less than 100,000 sesterces --
#4 120,000
All  have is my best Thracians
(to Proximo) And  want to see this famous Spaniard of yours -- his reputation soars from the provinces
The people are eager for him -- won't throw my Spaniard into a spectacle
Damn you and damn the rotation
You will and the price will be 90,000 sesterces each -- (to all) -- which you all know is exorbitant --     - #4 My Thracians are worth --
Give me your best, brothers
They die before Caesar
He strides back to the arena
The touts instantly begin making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious "Carthage Spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out
Proximo walks with Trainer #4: give you 30,000 my Spaniard will kill at least one of your Thracians
#4 30,000
On a Spaniard
That provincial sun has curdled your brain
Then make the wager, you smug bastard
They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the while
-   - Maximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators are being armed
They all wear mask-like helmets
Proximo hurries to them
All right -- there are three other teams, four men each -- (to Maximus) You know what a Thracian looks like
Yes, but -- Ignore the others -- go for the Thracians
The sun is to the east -- over the gate -- keep your back to the gate and you won't have the sun
What --
Trumpets begin sounding from the arena
Hurry --
The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading to a dark tunnel to the arena
Die well and we'll sing songs about you for a generation
Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate rises
They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to the arena
The gate closes behind them
The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly walk down the tunnel to
-  - At last we see it
The mighty Colosseum Arena
Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering faces
It is staggering
But for Maximus none of this exists
His full attention is focused on one spot alone
The Imperial Box
He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box
The box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the top of a sheer black marble wall
cohort of fifty imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box
Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like modern Secret Service agents
Commodus is untouchable
Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to the arena
As Cassius orates to the crowd: This day we reach back to hallowed antiquity to bring you (the crowd cheers) On the barren armies of the barbarian Hannibal
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors of all brute nations bent on merciless conquest
Your Emperor is pleased to give you
He gestures to the gladiators in the arena
The crowd laughs, jeering the "barbarians
" The drummers begin pounding out a more insistent, heroic beat
But on that illustrious day the Gods sent against them Rome's greatest warriors
The very life-image of nobility and glorious valor
who would on this day, and on these same arid Numidian deserts, decide Your Emperor is pleased to give you The crowd  in cheers as the huge doors at one end of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder in -- Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica Segmentata
chaos of dust -- and the battle is on -- The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping up a deadly hail of arrows
Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free
And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and leads his gladiators in battle
They follow him faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned
His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the gladiators work together
This kind of slaughter could last for hours
We see flashes of the endless battle
Maximus races on his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the chariot smashes into a wall
the sun sinks lower, the shadows on the sand lengthen
areas of the sand are swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting
Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots collide
the crowd roars
a gladiator is dragged between a chariot and the side wall of the arena
the drummers pound out their relentless tattoo
Finally
Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot
We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators are still alive
The rest of the arena is polluted with the dead and injured
Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms toward Maximus -- The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle -- Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like Medieval jousters -- And collide in a flashing explosion of steel -- Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails from his chariot -- Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races to the final charioteer
The charioteer is defeated but not dead
Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated
He stands over the final charioteer
Then he simply tosses down his sword
The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy
But then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after wave of adulation for the hero of the day
Maximus looks around, taking it all in
Then he turns to the Imperial Box
Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box
The Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing down at him
Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask
Commodus returns his gaze, curious
The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet
What is going on
Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away
Slave
Who are you
The Colosseum is suddenly silent
The Emperor is speaking to a gladiator
Maximus keeps walking
Maximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now
Commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder -- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus
Maximus stops
Maximus can hold it no longer
He spins to Commodus -- ripping off his helmet mask -- and : , Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is mystified -- -- The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill the defiant slave -- But something extraordinary stops them
Almost as one being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and thrust their thumbs up
They cheer and stomp their approval of Maximus
Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed
He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his thumb up
The Praetorians lower their bows
And the crowd cheers
Never in the long, long history of the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing
Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena
-   - To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging
He sits quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model of the Colosseum
He moves model pieces around in the Colosseum, planning his festival
Lucilla stands, tense
Why is he still alive
don't know
He shouldn't be alive
That vexes me
am terribly vexed
Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the explosion
He carefully moves some model pieces in the arena
There, that's better
Do you like the platform here
Mmm
do too
Simple, elegant
Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus' unusual serenity
Father would have wanted something more ornate but he's dead now
beat
Commodus laughs
beat
Maximus Meridas haunts me
see Father turning away from me and gazing at him
How many times did suffer that indignity,  wonder
What are you going to do
'm going to kill him
Good
(glances at her) Oh, you're too clever, Sister
Don't tell me part of you won't weep for him
When he defies my brother the Emperor, he defies me
But you shouldn't send assassins
No
The people embraced him today
They will be expecting his next match
(she kneels next to him) let him die in the arena like the slave he is
Let the people see what comes of defying Caesar
beat as he looks at her
He wounded you deeply, didn't he
Long ago
She does not answer
Nonetheless, your political acumen is, as always, unerring
He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena
He looks at the model tiger and smiles
'  -  - Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba
They hear footsteps outside the cell
Maximus stands, preparing for death
(also standing) will fight with you
This isn't your battle
Better to die for a friend than to die for gold
The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo sweeping in with a cloaked woman
The woman gives Proximo a bag of money
Enjoy yourself, Madame
(he glances to Maximus) General, perform well and there will be riches for you
He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind them
The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla
Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing
Rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions
Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the spot
He finally bumps into a wall of the cell
knew your brother would send assassins
didn't think he would send his best
Maximus, listen to me -- My family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive
knew nothing of that
(low) Don't lie to me
wept for them
Don't
long, tense moment
She does not look at him
Do you know what it is to be the daughter of the Emperor
learned on the night my father had my husband killed
loved my husband very much
Very
simply
He was a man who believed in the Republic
He was a man who thought Marcus should be tending to Rome and not conquering the world
One night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the Senate
My father never spoke of it
never spoke of it
That is what it is to be the daughter of Rome
She finally looks up at Maximus
My son will live
He will survive this cursed bloodline
Rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive
Empires come and go
Cities crumble to dust
Only family matters
beat
Despite himself, Maximus is moved
My son was innocent
So is mine
beat
want your brother dead
So do
beat
Maximus is surprised at her direct answer
My son will never be safe while he lives
beat
How do you plan it
The Senate is with us, and the City Guard
We have growing power in the streets
But we need a leader
Someone the people can -- So the crown passes to your son
No
So that my son will be safe
So that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back
Look into my eyes, Maximus, and believe what  say to you
She rivets him intensely with her eyes
By all the Gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband  loved swear to stand by your side in this now and always
beat
What is your son's name
Lucius Verus
Like his father
weep for him
long beat
Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing
Lucilla turns and starts to go
She stops, not looking back
Commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena
He's planning something
will pray for you
As  have always done
She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down, a little bundle wrapped in cloth
She sweeps out
The sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side
Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has left
He opens the cloth
Inside are his six "ancestor" figures
He picks up one of the figures
He looks at it deeply, gently feeling along the contours with a finger
-  - The Colosseum is again packed
Commodus, Lucilla and her son Lucius are in the Imperial Box
It is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the arena after a bout
They haul off carcasses and toss down fresh sand
Meanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd: in his majestic charity the Emperor has deigned to this day favor the people of Rome with an historical final match
Returning to the Colosseum today
after five years in retirement
Caesar is pleased to bring you (the crowd is going mad) The crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as  explodes into the arena in an ornate chariot
Tiger is a fierce man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena
Tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot, raising an arm in triumph
The crowd roars
-   - Proximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on armor
Gods
That old Homicide
The Emperor must truly hate you
What can you tell me
He cheats
-  - Tiger waits
He stands in the center of the arena
He has only a traditional short sword
The crowd is breathless with anticipation
As: (orating) And from the rocky promontories and martial bloodlines of Spain
representing the training lyceum of Proximo Antoninus
give you
The crowd cheers
Maximus appears from his gate
His fans have increased in number considerably
They eagerly crane forward and celebrate him
Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger
Only one man with a sword
Maximus approaches, cautious but confident
He stops a few feet from Tiger
They lock eyes, salute each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising their swords
The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words
We who are about to die salute you
The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back -- The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are perfectly matched -- As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels something -- a vibration in the ground -- Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view
On each platform is a snarling Bengal tiger restrained by a chain
Tiger's teams of "cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system
The cornermen are safely inside cages
The platforms stop at ground level
The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the battleground
Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another tiger snaps at him -- Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts -- And then all four tigers are suddenly closer
The teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground
The crowd roars
But the fight is hardly fair
Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit
Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally, Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under Tiger's swinging sword and  into him -- they fall -- a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back -- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat
Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed
Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus -- Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword -- Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos -- Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with superhuman effort so it is always between himself and Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him -- Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground -- Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de grace
All eyes turn to the Emperor
Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the Imperial Box
He raises his arm and gives the fatal thumbs down
Maximus looks up at him
And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground, refusing to kill Tiger
Commodus is stunned
The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and then an enormous roar building
It cascades around the Colosseum
It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected act of mercy
And the delicious act of defiance of the Emperor
Commodus slowly sits
Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and cheer for him
Cries of "Maximus the Merciful" can be heard
It is the birth of a hero
-   - Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head down, deep in thought
' Is it true you're a General
Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell
Maximus has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan -- but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance to his own son
was a General
saw you fight
The Carthage battle too
've never seen so much courage
It doesn't take courage to kill
My father was killed
beat
'm sorry
He still comes to me in my dreams
Do you have a father
had a father
He wasn't really my father but  cared for him very much
hope he comes to you in your dreams
My father and  ride horses in mine
These simple words strike something deep in Maximus
Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on Lucius' shoulders
Lucius, run along now
need to talk to the General
Lucius runs off to his Male , who leads him away
long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other
Finally: Where is my army
drum beat is heard
It increases throughout the following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery accelerating to ramming speed
The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing popularity with the People of Rome
-  - Maximus is fighting an opponent
The drums continue
- Lucilla conspires with Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus in a dark corner of the Senate
Whispers
Maximus will summon his army from Ostia and he will strike from the inside as his army strikes from the outside
But he insists that the Senate be present
We've been ordered to attend
How many are with us
About half
But once the tyrant is dead
All
beat
want to meet him
'll arrange it
And what of the Emperor
beat
He has withdrawn
He's not eating
He doesn't go out
He won't even see me
don't know what tempests rage within him but
We should fear for the blackest storm
Yes
beat
One question
who is to be the actual Regicide
beat
She glances at him
The drums continue
-  - Maximus defeats his opponent
He stands over him
He does not kill him
He tosses his sword down and walks away
The crowd goes crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus
Senator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some alarm
He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus
He is becoming a hero to the people
The drums continue
-   - Maximus returns to the holding cells
Vibius and Juba are waiting
You didn't kill him
will not kill another warrior
There is no honor to it
Maximus goes
Vibius thinks about it, listening to the adulation of the crowd
The drums continue
/
-   - Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on the way from the arena
gang of children run alongside the cart, cheering and chanting: Maximus the Merciful
Maximus the Merciful
The drums continue
'  -  - Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus
Lucilla is writing on a piece of parchment
Tell him we will enter Rome on the first day of Commodus' festival
And they will march on Rome for you
Yes
But this letter must go to the lieutenant named Titus, no one else
Captain Marcellus will take it
And his City Guard will by with you when you get to Rome
Is that enough to face the Praetorian Guard
(looks to her) The Felix Regiment will never be defeated
beat
only have one question for you, General
Why
beat
You will lead an army of your brothers on Rome
Many will die
Why
want Commodus dead
That's not the reason
Tell me the truth
beat
Because one night an old man whispered to me about a dream will die for that dream
long beat
knew the old man well
And loved him very much
In our youth we would spend hours building that dream together
After he went to the wars and lost his way
was very cruel
tormented him to remember that dream we spoke of
He did
You can have no idea how much that means to me
beat
Any man who will die for a whispered dream deserves my respect
honor you, General
The drums continue
-  - Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him
He looks around at the crowd
Then he tosses down his sword and walks off
The crowd goes mad with pleasure
Vibius eats it up, raising his arms and soaking up the applause
Maximus watches from the holding cells
He smiles
The drums continue
- Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled
It covers the side of a tall building
It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus
Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit to illuminate the mammoth banner
The drums continue
-  - The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators triumphant
The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance
We note many placard and banners honoring " " Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive
The crowd roars
They have completely embraced Maximus and his fellow gladiators
Gracchus, in the stands, laughs
The drums finally conclude
- '  - Lucilla is with her
They sit before a large mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the day
One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows
Madame, the Emperor would like to see you
Lucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with the Centurion
-  - Lucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor to Commodus' chambers
She enters
- '  - Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window
Caesar
He turns
She stops
He looks as if he has not slept for days
If a word could now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented
She goes to him, embraces him
He holds her tightly
am sorry to have kept you away
needed this time to think
Of course
He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room
limited my world to these four walls so as to let my mind free
again and again my mind settles on but one question
What kind of world are we making when the people of Rome prefer a slave in the arena to their father
beat
Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving Lucilla
It is my responsibility to make the world as it should be
How is it have made this world
Brother, do not be influenced by the mob
They are a great, faceless beast -- They are not "the mob," Lucilla, they are the people
They are my children and all  want to do is love them
beat
He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius
He touches it
Our father loved Maximus
and love him still
yet he defies me, he tasks me in front of my children
And they love him for it
Just as Marcus loved him for it
Tell me why, Lucilla
They see themselves in him
They throw in their own sad dreams alongside his
They think he fights for them
And what do  do but fight for them
give them games to please them
strangle dissent to give them peace
empower the Praetorians to give them order
What more can  do
beat
Say  should fight him, in the arena
Let my children see who the Gods truly favor
And what if he should win
beat
Commodus continues to slowly move around the room
God is more powerful than a man
This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment
Then: Caesar, you let this unduly worry you
At best he is a passing fancy -- he is a name, an image on a banner, ephemeral -- he will be forgotten as the next fancy appears -- But  need to know -- why do they love him
Mercy
He stops
Looks at her
He will not kill in the arena
He is merciful
As they all wish they were in their own hearts
Something in her words has struck a chord in him
And for that moment in the arena they are merciful too
For a moment
they are Gods
Offering life
He looks at her
But who can be more merciful than the Emperor of Rome
-  - Maximus is fighting a thick  of a man
few quick blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes to the sand
The arena cheers their hero
Maximus stands over the beaten Giant
The crowd waits for the famous act
Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword, refusing to kill
He walks away
The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the Merciful" grows to deafening proportions
Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos -- horrified -- The Praetorians surround Maximus
He is unarmed, but coils for the inevitable battle
Then the Praetorians part
And Commodus walks through them
He carries something wrapped in a rich cloth
Maximus glares at him
The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly
The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last
Maximus and Commodus stare at each other
The crowd cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this incredible confrontation
Brother
we've taken a sad path since we were children at Capri, have we not
Maximus doesn't answer
For my own part
am sorry it came to this
And to you alone of all men,  acknowledge my errors
And my regret
shall live with my sin for all my days
As will , Commodus
As will
Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle
Inside is a small wooden sword
He holds it up so the crowd can see
collective gasp
The wooden sword, prized by all gladiators above all else
Freedom
As the first act of my contrition offer you the wooden sword of freedom
He holds out the wooden sword
beat
Take it, brother
Stand at my side as a free man worthy of your ancestors
only have ancestors because of you, brother
You killed everything that ever lived alongside me
beat
Take it, Maximus
Let us heal that fatal wound together
This is the new home you cursed me to
And  am safer here from your treachery than  could ever be outside
Will you always mistrust me
Why don't you ask your father that
Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the wooden sword out
The crowd is breathless
have more power as a slave in the arena than  could ever have as a free man
As the Colosseum goes, the people go
As the people go, the Empire goes
(tense) You think this is power
could show you power, slave -- No, Caesar
will show you
With that, Maximus does the unimaginable
He simply turns his back on the Emperor and walks away
And the crowd goes mad
They cheer the defiant gladiator, their champion
And, equally, they deride the Emperor
They mock him by holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out the wooden sword
They laugh and jeer
Commodus glances around at his children, lost
Then he turns to the Imperial Box
He sees Lucilla slipping out the back of the box
He watches her go
And the crowd continues to jeer
- The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a typically ribald comedy in a secluded street: An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus, riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a wooden sword
The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and wails like an infant
Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on his way out of Rome
'  -  - Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius
He draws a circle in the sand with a stick
He draws a line to the circle
The Felix Regiment will come from here
We'll face the body of the Praetorians outside -- here
Once inside, my archers will take up position to counter opposition inside the Colosseum
'll enter and join you -- we'll attack here -- Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box
-- a covert assault from within
We'll be killed
Probably
beat
But if we aren't
think of the glory
Do you remember glory, Gladiator
And if we die that day -- we die free men worthy of our ancestors
You didn't know my ancestors rotten bunch
Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars
Then be worthy of him
The old Titan who would rather die bravely in a just battle than slink off to grow old and fat
And impotent
beat
Vibius thinks about it
If  die,  want a hundred whores at my funeral
- '  - Commodus sweeps in
Thinks Lucilla is standing there
The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden
Where is my sister
She's out, sir
Where
don't know, Caesar
Commodus looks at her for a moment
And then he slowly walks right to her
His face an inch away from hers
Where is my sister
'  - '  - Proximo sits, considering Maximus
Was it Centurion
General
Captain
beat
How did you know
soldier knows a soldier
beat
All that was a long time ago
Too much wine and too many women
And too much money
No -- This is who  am
(he pats his ample belly) You see
There was a time  would stand against ten men and never give an inch, spitting into the jaws of Hades all the while
There was a time my heart swelled to strap on the armor of Rome
But now
Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like tragedy
Now  am just an entertainer
pause
You said something to me once
You said in this life, we all die
All we can choose is how we die
And how we are remembered
Do you recall those words
Yes
Then be remembered proudly
This is your time, Proximo
Stand at my side and be what you were
What you truly are
One last time
beat
Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically -- Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show up -- he bursts into laughter
Maximus stares at him
(laughing) You might have spared yourself the speech, General
The lady Lucilla bought all my gladiators two hours ago
You pox-ridden bastard --
am the richest trainer in the Empire
And  will let my gladiators do anything you like
Conspire away, General
Maximus can only laugh as well
But  tell you -- if you survive this madness  want you to go into business with me
'll give you a quarter of my holdings
(standing) quarter
third
And not a hair more
And you'll have to start in the provinces
Cleaning up the lion shit
You know, if you were half so awful as you pretend, you'd be a terrifying man
Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes
Proximo sits for a moment
Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest
He looks at the chest for a moment and then opens it
Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata
He gazes at his armor, considering what he once was
And what he now is
'  -  - Maximus enters
Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense
Lucilla -- Don't even say it
know it's dangerous -- but  had to see you
Captain Marcellus has gone to the army with your message as you instructed
Good
He says the City Guard will be ready at the south road at noon
They can only wait for an hour so -- You've told me this already
Did
All right then
So everything is prepared
The Senate will be in attendance and you have your gladiators -- the usual cohort of Praetorians will be inside the arena -- Lucilla
why are you here
pause
Tell me honestly
please
do you think it will work
beat
No
Do you think we'll all die
Yes
She leans against a wall
pause
Will you swear something to me
Yes
Will you swear it on the memory of your son
long beat
Yes
By all that you have ever loved
swear that if you survive you will take my son out of Rome
Swear that you will go far away and never return
He steps to her
(deeply) will
beat
And if  should not survive
swear to me that you will honor my family in your prayers always
will
long, difficult beat
She fights back tears
Had  not been the daughter of Rome
He puts a gentle finger to her lips
Shhh
my heart breaks enough
He holds her closely, tenderly
- '  - Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her meeting with Maximus
She suddenly stops
Frozen
Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his knee
An open scroll on Commodus' lap
Sister
join us
've been reading to dear Lucius
've been reading too
Yes, he's a very smart little boy
He'll make a grand Emperor one day
Lucilla has not moved
Join us, sister
Lucilla goes to them, sits
We've been reading about the great Julius and his adventures in Egypt
She killed herself with a snake
(to Lucius) And just wait until you hear what happened to some of our other ancestors
If you're very good, tomorrow night 'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius
He was betrayed
By those closest to him
(he glances up to Lucilla) by his own blood
they whispered in dark corners and went out late at night and conspired and conspired
Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill
Lucius is busy scanning the scroll
Commodus gently strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's
But the Emperor Claudius knew that they were up to something dire
He knew they were busy little bees
And one night he sat down with one of them and he looked at her and he said:  "Tell me what you have been doing, busy little bee, or  shall strike down those dearest to you
You shall watch as  bathe in their blood
"  And the bee knew he spoke the truth, for the Emperor always speaks the truth
And what do you think happened then, Lucius
(still pouring over the scrolls) don't know, Uncle
(glaring at Lucilla) The bee told him everything
Lucilla's face is tortured
'  - '  - Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the steady clip-clop of horses on stone
lot of horses
He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street outside
stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into position at his gates
Proximo grabs his clothes -- '  - With cool military precision the Praetorians take up position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an unassailable line
They quickly prepare their bows
Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that entrance as well
'  -  - Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is followed by hundreds more -- The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now -- shouting -- Proximo races to his panicked guards -- Release them
Release them all
The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators as quickly as they can -- Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped inside -- The compound is soon a raging inferno -- Proximo releases Maximus and Juba -- Come -- But -- If you want to live -- follow me -- (calling to them) Go, Spaniard
We'll show these Roman dogs how gladiators fight
Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other gladiators arm themselves -- - Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a decaying cramped tunnel
All the old gladiator schools have tunnels to the Colosseum -- most have long since collapsed -- How did they know
We were betrayed
(stops) 'll stay here
In case they follow
Maximus stops as well
Go
Bring us the army
Maximus nods
Quickly -- He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of tunnels -- '  - Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance
It is not a battle, it is a slaughter
The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless rain of flaming arrows continues -- Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies reaching for the statue of Mars
-  - Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the Colosseum
(points) Down that corridor is the butchery -- the blood sloughs lead to the Tiber
Gods watch over you
You're not coming
They are killing my men
He races back into the tunnel
Maximus moves quickly down the corridor
He can finally see
-  - Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks
Two bored butchers hack them up
The good bits are tossed into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals
The waste and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the blood and carcasses
Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of hanging carcasses and flies
When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood sluice -- out of sight -- Then he thuds to a stop
He can go no further because the remains of an animal carcass blocks his way
He tries to slither past the carcass -- Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate and a torrent of water flows down
Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer
- Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and the screams of burning men
They run
They round a corner and see there is no way past the world of flame ahead of them
The tunnel to the compound has collapsed
Gods
they're killing them all
Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to
'  - They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the arms of the Praetorian Guard
Proximo and Juba are bound
Proximo sees his compound burning
Sees the Praetorian archers taking out any last survivors
Hears the screams
/
-   - quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard units round up many associated with the plot
And many that are not
' :  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and hauled out
:   congregation of Christians is chained together, their secret altar smashed
:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls
:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a performance
'  :  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with his handsome catamite
unit of Praetorian bursts in
Gracchus looks at them
Sighs
-   - Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the city
The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can easily be seen
What is that fire
Why that's a bonfire, Lucius arranged it just for you
He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder
Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair
Her face is a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do
Two Praetorians enter with a bucket
Caesar
Commodus goes to them
He talks quietly with them for a moment and glances at what they are carrying
Oh
that's for my sister
They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her
Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the balcony
Lucilla glances inside the bucket
Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine
Lucilla moans
All is lost
- Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber, gasping for air
Animal carcasses float up next to him
He grabs onto one and floats down the gently flowing river
-  - The Wolf of Rome sleeps
Then its ears rise
Then its head
It sniffs the air
The wolf slowly rises and begins loping through the camp
It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily drifting up from campfires
The wolf finally stops and looks up
Maximus is on a horse
He climbs down
The wolf goes to him and licks his hand
Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his side
Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is alive
Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus
They continue to march through the camp, more and more astonished soldiers joining them
They march toward the large tents at the center of the encampment
Titus emerges from his tent
Slams to a stop -- By all the Gods
He goes to Maximus and embraces him
Old friend
You're returned from Hades
By all the Gods
Where is he
Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent
He stares at Maximus, unbelieving
long beat as they look at each other
Quintus knows his destiny
With quiet dignity he begins whispering a prayer
Maximus moves to him, embracing him: forgive you
He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him
Quintus falls
beat
Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of office from his uniform
He hands it to Maximus
An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment
- '  - castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration
Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate around Commodus' bedroom
The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe
His body slaves work over him closely
He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him
The castrati hymn continues
- The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the Colosseum
It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day
Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward the Colosseum entrances
Vendors are doing brisk business
Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter past
We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena stands
- The hymn is all we hear as we see
The stands are filling
We see the rich and poor alike
We see the orator Cassius
We see Senator Falco and most of the Senate
We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian taking up position around the Imperial Box
golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot over the arena
We float down the stairs and then we see the arena itself
It is stunning in its simplicity
The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the arena
Suspended above them is an enormous cloud thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a threatening rain cloud
We see Proximo and Juba
We see Senators Gracchus and Gaius
We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and Christian families and scholars and actors
Seven stylized hills surround them
The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the damned
: Later
By now, the Colosseum is packed
All fifty-five thousand seats are taken
Another ten thousand stand wherever they can
feral anticipation buzzes through the crowd
Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with thousands more who couldn't get in
Trumpets blare
Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the Imperial Box
Then Commodus enters
He is shrouded in a full lion's skin, the head of the lion concealing his own
His head is down, he does not look up
Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit
Lucilla's face is drained, her eyes defeated
Lucius is wearing a miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with ceremonial dagger
- mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the outskirts of Rome
The street is deserted
It seems that almost everyone is at the Colosseum
The dog stops
Looks up
Then a sound is heard
The steady cadence of horses' hooves
The Felix Regiment rounds a corner
Maximus leads the cavalry
He wears Lorica Segmentata
His corps of archers and soldiers follow
They troop down the dusty street
Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog
: The Felix Regiment moves through the streets
The few pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around corners
The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in the distance
Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries
The Felix Regiment continues its stealth invasion
Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop
The mounted City Guard are waiting
Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two combined forces continue their inexorable march to the Colosseum
- Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down, slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the Imperial Box
The crowd grows hushed
Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a moment
Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin
The crowd gasps
He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in gold
His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks around at his people
He finally speaks: (serene) Rome
This is the day that was foretold
This is the day when your father takes away all fear
(he holds up his hands) With these hands  shall destroy your enemies so that you may sleep always and forever in peace
From this day forth let it be known that , Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, have surmounted mortality
That , Lucius Aelius Aurelius Commodus, assume my destined place
at the side of the Gods
The crowd is stunned
few scattered laughs
Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving
And as a righteous God,  shall ever protect you
shall cradle the world on my benevolent hands and clasp it to my heart
So  have spoken
And let the heavens tremble at my might
- Maximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and City Guard cavalry through the streets
The roaring is closer now
They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building
- Commodus continues: This day  reclaim Rome for her people
shall give you the rebirth of your Empire
Reborn and cleansed of her enemies
He raises his arms
At his cue the Praetorian archers raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims
will make a new Rome
Founded as it was at the beginning
Archers -- The Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and fire -- They shoot the cloud -- the bladder  and thick blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over them, coating them
- The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the Praetorians
The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued, watching the face-off
The mounted archers of the Felix Regiment have drawn their bows
Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer
Throw down your weapons or we will kill you
beat
The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force against him
He drops his sword
His men follow suit
(he turns to his men) He spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the Praetorian -- - Commodus continues: As it was at the beginning so is it now
The great She-Wolf of Rome will again suckle us, again ravage our enemies -- At his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view, rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand
On each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they snap and growl, straining to be released
So it was for Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars, so shall it be for us
The great She-Wolf will -- Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering into the arena
The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla bolts up -- Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning -- His Praetorian are momentarily confused -- At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly -- multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining Praetorians fire back -- Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the prisoners free -- Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes -- She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him -- Remember your mother
She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him away as -- Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace -- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he kisses her -- long kiss as he holds her tightly to him
Then he gently sits her down on her throne
Her eyes wide, dying
One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him: Caesar -- we must go --
Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out of the Imperial Box -- He grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off -- They try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up toward them -- ,
Below, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel
Maximus cuts Juba and Proximo free
Juba immediately snatches up a sword
Maximus quickly offers a sword to Proximo
Captain
Proximo takes the sword
(re: Commodus and the others) Where are they going
This way
They race across the arena and into a tunnel
-  - Proximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six Centurions coming the other direction
The final battle begins with no preamble -- Maximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword -- Commodus slams back -- Proximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights as a man reborn, alive again -- Proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy counterweights -- Maximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake, means death -- Meanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions -- Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a corner -- He screams to one of his remaining Centurions: Maximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus -- Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into him -- Juba flings his sword across the room -- the final Centurion falls -- Maximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying -- Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the wall
The old pirate shrugs
And is dead
Juba races to Lucius and holds the boy, turning his face away from the slaughter -- Maximus, his furious passion redoubled at Proximo's death, attacks Commodus with every ounce of strength in him -- Commodus' eyes begin to flash with something we have never seen before, fear
Maximus strikes mercilessly -- forcing Commodus steadily back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator platforms to the arena above
For my wife
Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow -- For my son
He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing -- For my father
He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus -- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling -- Maximus stands over him
Glaring
Commodus is panting, defeated, glaring up at him
beat
We who are about to die salute you
Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm -- Maximus  the sword down -- and Commodus is dead
moment as Maximus stands over Commodus
Then he looks at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator platform
He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins to rise
-  - trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises to the sand of the arena
Maximus stands above the dead Emperor
The crowd stares in amazement -- and then begins to cheer in joy at the return of their hero
chant begins
"Maximus the Merciful
Maximus the Merciful
Maximus the Merciful
" which then grows to a refrain of "Caesar
Caesar
Caesar
" Maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight: Lucilla
He goes to the steps of the platform leading to the Imperial Box
He slowly climbs the steps
In the Imperial Box, Senator Gracchus is standing
So too Juba and others
Lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his head down
Lucilla is dead
Lucius mourns with quiet dignity
Maximus looks at Lucilla and kneels
He takes her other hand
long moment
He looks at Lucius
Then he slowly bends forward and kisses Lucilla deeply, the ritual farewell
He stands
Senator Gracchus steps to him: General, the purple is yours if you so desire
The Senate will support you
Maximus looks at him
And then at the people
The chant of "Caesar
Caesar
Caesar
" is like a powerful beating heart
Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address the people
The crowd grows silent
Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena
Rome
you are better than this
Look inside yourselves
challenge you to find your true voice
Help the Senate speak for you
Make them your champion
And dare to think what could be
beat
give you back the dream
With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the arena sand
The crowd is absolutely silent
He goes to Titus: When everything has calmed down, lead an orderly withdrawal
Take them home
Titus salutes
Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse
As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look at Lucilla
He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on the arena sand, gazing at him
Maximus stops his horse
He canters back to Lucius
The boy looks up at him moment between them
Lucius thrusts up his hand
Maximus grabs his hand and swings him onto the horse behind him
look to Juba
Juba bows his head with respect
Farewell
Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of the Colosseum
Juba disappears into the crowd
Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the huge doors
- From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome
: - Maximus stands with Lucius at his old vineyard
It is still scorched and dead, weeds overgrowing the vineyards, the house ruined
Maximus puts a hand on the boy's shoulder, this boy so like his own son
It doesn't look it now
but soon we'll have it growing again
Next year there will be vines, and then there will be grapes
It will be alive
We leave them, dreaming of the future
