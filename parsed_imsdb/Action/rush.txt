The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in Germany), the past three days is on it's way out

The eye stares
Blinks
Thinks
Making evaluations

-  -                                    3 The first rays of sunshine break through
The voices of international  commentators in different languages
in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken
The race is going ahead

-                                                 4 The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 wearing a fireproof balaclava
Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion
His name is painted on the side of his Ferrari
(/) My grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve - we are remembered for very little
So make sure it's the right things
stares up at the clouds
His eyelids flicker
Thinking
Agonizing
Wrestling with an all important decision
Is it going to carry on raining
Or become dry
Should he be using slicks or wets

-                                           5 We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major Grand Prix
All around us

An walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One Minute"
Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently
This is bullshit
We have no control over our legacy
We cannot choose what we are remembered for
Ferrari  rushes towards , and shouts in Italian above the noise, (we see sub-titles)
Mass usa slicks
Le vuoi cambiare anche tu
(Mass is going on slicks
You want to change
) looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him
team of hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres
Otherwise  wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole
And the 1976 season
then looks over at the car in pole position beside him
Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack
What about Hunt
Has he changed
No, he's going on wets
The car in pole position:  , surrounded by  crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on
The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but makes up for this with magnetism
The rock star of F1
's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot-looking
don't know why it became such a big thing
We were just drivers
Busting each other's balls
To me this is perfectly normal
But other people saw it differently

And changed us both somehow
Forever
stares, then
Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato
(Then we go on wets, too
) The ten-second board is held up
pulls down his visor
as he and 's eyes meet for a split-second, eyes staring
selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine
The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000 Maybe that explains the state of mind was in
And why it happened
The other thing 'm remembered for
(a beat) On August 1st, that same year
: " 1st, 1976"
The  waves the flag
's foot hits the floor - his engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd
's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt
gets away first
good start
But within seconds there's a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck
His arch-rival
But as the McLaren roars past,  sees a white helmet
Number 12
It's not Hunt
It's
On his bald, slick tyres
curses under his breath
He screwed up
Made the wrong decision
Should have gone on slicks
He urgently needs to change tyres
swerves angrily into the pits
Ferrari's pit is right at one end

-                                                    6 Commentary from all the world's  stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as all the  come into the pits to change to dry tyres
It's chaos
traffic jam of Formula 1 cars
The Ferrari team frantically work
Changing 's tyres
Four men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks
The same Italian  appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car
Hair visto
Ti aveto detto di usare le slicks
(See
told you to go on slicks
) Bullshit
Where's Hunt
There
looks up to see the name   written on the black helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on
'mon
screams at the , who are struggling
The airguns make a high-pitched noise
something's not right
What's
"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and exit the pits in pursuit of

Into 13th place now
Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres
's
: the world flies past in a blur
The steering wheel shakes
The car is right on the edge
Cannot be driven any harder
approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of the course
turns left at the Bergwerk corner
Crazy speed
And tight
Too tight
mistake
"Thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the inside
tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155 mph
The car jerks horribly to the right
"Crunch", hits the embankment, then "Bang", hits the barrier, and is thrown across the track
Fire breaks out in the engine
's eyes widen in horror, with another car bearing down upon him
No
The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, "Crash", a sickening, terrifying impact
The car explodes
Seventy litres of burning high-octane gasoline, with  strapped inside, unable to undo his seatbelt
Locked in a blast furnace
screams as the flames engulf him
800 degrees temperature
Trapped inside his car
Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs
Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked commentators helplessly describe what's happening
's : he can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other  rushing towards
Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo 's seatbelt
Fire extinguishers blast at the car
Dry powder extinguishers
Covering 's helmet
Blurring his vision, as he cries out in agony, inhaling the powder
Screaming voices
Panicked reactions
On the side of the car, the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts

to reveal a tall, good-looking driver,  , (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair

He rocks

He's lost it
And has no one to blame but himself

And stubbornness

As far as he's concerned

Do you fly
No
You should try it
If something goes wrong up there, you're on the edge, but have to stay within the rules
Stick to regulations
Suppress the ego
It's good discipline for the racing
And there  was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight
should have known better
What brings you here

friend's wedding
At least  think it was a wedding
Might have been a birthday
All a bit of a blur
How about you
Been at Fiorano
Pre-season testing
Already
In February
You're relentless
Thank you
'm not sure  meant it as a compliment
But it is one
Relentlessness is good
Means you're a fighter
That you never give up
Behind my back  know some of you guys call me `The Rat
' Because look like one
It's meant as an insult
But  don't mind it
Rats are ugly, sure
And no one likes them
But they're intelligent
With a strong survival instinct
can't help smiling
That's
So when do you start testing
Next week
Are you mad
didn't just win the biggest thing of my life so  could get right back to work
Why
You need to
To prove to all the people who will always say you only won it because
Because what
Because of your accident
Is that other people, Niki
Or you
won
On the all important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms in equally good cars

It's true
You won that race
And believe me if  had to lose that title to anyone, 'm happy it was you
But that doesn't change the fact you have to win again
Why
Because that's what it means to be a winner, no
It's a permanent condition
Never stops or goes away
It stays with you always
That's winning
Sounds like losing to me
Some of life needs to be for pleasure, Niki
What's the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun
How is that winning
The plane load of 's friends call out
"'mon, James
" You're right
could learn from you
In hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum
Pumping the shit out of my lungs
It was agony
While doing it,  was watching television
you winning all those races
and  was cursing you
"That bastard, Hunt",  would shout, " hate that guy
" one day the doctor said, "Mr
Lauda, may  offer one piece of advice
Stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life
It can be a blessing, too
"  said, "Who are you, Confucius
" He said, " wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends
" And you know, he's right
Look at us
We were a pair of kids when we first met
Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3
Headed nowhere
Now we're both Champions of the world
Not bad
No, not bad

need you busting my balls
Get back to work

But  intend to enjoy myself first
And so should you
You think you can

blank look
See you on race day, Champ
You will
