verdant field in Gascony
from tree- tops
The   through green leaves
fox darts into a thick hedge
And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of
:   France, 1625
Suddenly, two young men burst  , sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air
The first is , bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet
The second, '
Younger in appearance and attitude
Exuberant, handsome
And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry
They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew
Girard is the more polished combatant
But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature
He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon
He tumbles and somer- saults
This is fun
Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft
As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props
Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots
Anything goes as the swords cut through the air
'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor
Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle
'Artagnan merely smiles
and follows
2                                                2 Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go
3                                               3 Inside the manor house, a   of forty glances up from her writing table, hears  on the roof
She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open window
As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side

4                                                   4 Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en- closure filled with
'Artagnan flies after
The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt -- stumbles briefly
Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart
But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again
The epic battle continues
Girard's modest success de- volves into desperate flight
'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down
Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow- moving   up the country road
He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him
And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn- ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display
Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge
Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles
'Artagnan has his man and he knows it
He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below
comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay
5                                                  5 Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach
'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow
He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple
long beat
Then a surprise
Girard begins to laugh, long and loud
'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile
' Had enough
(breathless deadpan) believe now would be a good time to end your, uhm, formal training
Well done

'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another word
Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked
And god have mercy on whomever you meet next

But he does not see her
'Artagnan continues, chatter- ing proudly as he goes
' Did you see us
You heard us, 'll bet
Girard finally surrendered a compliment
though  almost had to kill him to get it
Mother
'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond
He pauses, then steps inside

His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open chest
Your father was a proud man
And he had a right to be
never knew one as brave or as kind
He knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor
That is why he dedicated his life to his country and his King
That is why he gave his life, for both
She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a beautiful saber
watched you this morning and saw someone  knew
You have your father's heart, his will to fight, his courage
But these gifts have no value unless they are given
She rises, holds the sword out to him
It's time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are
In Paris

bittersweet moment
'Artagnan posed before his first great adventure
But not completely certain that he wishes to leave home
' Mother
Maybe  should wait
Until after harvest
'Artganan's mother smiles, understands
And speaks gently to urge him forward
You've heard that every man in the Musketeers is on the run from someone or something
' Yes
But what am  running from
(gentle humor) shrew of a mother, and a drafty old house
Now go
And in this fashion, she releases him
'Artagnan sweeps his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps into the saddle
The horse reacts with a start, skitters in a half-cicle
'Artagnan struggles to gain control, finally brings the horse to rein
He manages a charmed grin
His mother smiles, scolds: And for heaven's sake, practice your horsemanship
' Horsemanship
Got it
'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots off across bright green fields
His Mother shields her eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and watches him ride into the distance

The fallen emblem is retrieved by , an officer who wears the bright red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards
What should  do with this
Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in black finery,   a patch covers one eye
This is the ,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli- est swordsmen   in all of France
Throw it on the fire with everything else
But this is the emblem of the Musketeers
The Musketeers no longer exist
Or haven't you heard
(cold command) Throw it on the fire
Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is instantly consumed
Rochefort watches it burn, then walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard

The Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal the depth of their despair
The latter is supervised by the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies' plight with satisfaction
This is a sad day for the Musketeers, the end of an era

This is the saddest moment of all
Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his lips
He steps to the railing, addresses the men below
Musketeers
hundred faces turn   upward to regard him
And on each the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in black
Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con- tempt
He revels in    it
By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis  and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially disbanded
In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry
You will be contacted and told where to report
Until that time, you are instructed to return to your homes
(shouting to Rochefort) And who will protect the King
The Cardinal's Guards are more than capable of assuming that
responsibility
Muttered curses and dissent throughout
Rochefort raises his voice to be heard: You are hereby ordered to disperse
Should even one of you resist
the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned
(with pleasure and disdain) 'All for one, and one for all
' As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode
But before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com- manding voice calls out above the clamor

14   :    (2)                                          14 Musketeers
And with that, the Musketeers freeze
Their eyes go to de Treville
There is a moment of silence as de Treville chooses his words carefully
Even in defeat, de Treville is stoic
Go to your homes
Wait
Our day will come again
De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles in a patronizing manner
Then, de Treville leads his Musketeers out of the courtyard
15                                                     15 He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by
Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely
He goes to a mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak- ish angle
That's when he catches a glimpse of something behind him
Something red
Rochefort turns
a tall, powerfully built  stands in the shadows of the room, a spectre in red
Your Eminence
Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees
steps out of the darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes swirling about him like clouds of blood
His face is long, shrewd and intelligent
His eyes are penetrat- ing
He smiles his crocodile smile
Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls
It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and present
Have they all been accounted for

-                                    16 Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down Paris' most   colorful and notorious street
They react to    and   coming from a tavern ahead
The    one called
The Dead Rat
The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody
Just then:  window on the second floor bursts open, and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his feet, threatening to drop him into the street
The Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women, song -- is called
Jussac shouts: Release that man
Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges to the street with a dull thud
Then, with a wink and a piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside
Jussac darkens, signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern

17 Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight
But for now, all is calm
group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big table littered with flagons and bottles
On the floor around them are their swords and rifles
It appears the Gruards are celebrating a victory
But wait
There's something wrong with this picture
On closer inspection, we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under- clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes
They are all bruised and bloody
Some are unconscious
Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers
They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up

He is , the most handsome and dashing of the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of great personal charm and style
His companion is   , the Musketeers' deadliest and most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and tortured
Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three Musketeers, their   planner and strategist
At the moment, he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm
(approaching) What is this
Athos greets him with a dark smile
private party
Go away
Athos -- is that any way to greet our guests
Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously
He is the epitome of politeness
Don't be shy, gentlemen
Come in
Your friends have been expecting you
Jussac is not amused
Your presence is requested at Musketeer Headquarters by Captain Rochefort
Athos and Aramis exchange looks
The Cyclops is a Captain
He must've made a pact with the Devil
Or the Cardinal
What's the difference

Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber
You're instructed to come with me and surrender your tunics
With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody Guards around him
These gentlemen made a similar request
Are you refusing to come peaceably
Probably
But 'll leave it up to my companions
Aramis
We can't refuse Rochefort's invitation
It would be impolite
Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward
And what do you say, Porthos
To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon wheel chandelier
'll be right down
With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier
His weight causes the chains suspending it to break
With a whoop of pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them
When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared
He looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off

Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats, wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join Porthos
Congratulations, Porthos
You brought down the house
My aim was off
was trying to hit Jussac
Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look
Now
About those tunics
Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to the street
He mutters as if to curse: Musketeers

-                                   18 'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook- ing the magnificent city on the Seine
What he beholds is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven- teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky
For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true
'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of coming from behind
He turns in response and what he sees is this: Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback
19   '                                                     19 His heroic blood stirs
Women in danger
As the women past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse
Quickly formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road

The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense- less
One down
'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re- verses direction and  back, charging d'Artagnan
The rider draws his saber
'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword
He catches the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the saddle
The man lands with a painful thud at d'Artagnan's feet
Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is upon him with flying fists
One swift punch -- and the second rider is senseless
Two down
'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance
He looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened
The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark- haired girl in her late teens
Her name is
Her companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and equally beautiful
Her name is
Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan
She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off
Constance remains
She smiles down at d'Artagnan from atop her horse
Do you have any idea what you've done
' 've saved you and your friend from these bandits
These 'bandits' are the Queen's own bodyguards
'Artagnan is stunned
' The Queen
Constance points a finger in Anne's direction
If  were you, 'd make myself scarce
These men are going to be very angry when they wake up

Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like a prize idiot
' didn't know

Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling
Do you have a name
' 'Artagnan
You're a very foolish boy, d'Artagnan
but a very handsome one
Good-bye
Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with Anne
' (calling after her) Wait
You didn't tell me your name
But Constance is gone
'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time
The two bodyguards groan and grumble
bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye
He looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet
He picks it up and
' The man who attacked you
(pointing in the opposite direction) went that way
With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides like Hell

The place is a cemetery, haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers
Porthos is visibly distraught
Rochefort enters from behind an archway

He said he'll take those tunics
Tunics
Coming right up
Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards
He drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another
He finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve
There's one in his hat
Like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places
Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves
They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile

Sooner or later somebody's calling me 'outlaw

He's familiar with Porthos' propensity for tall tales
But not here, not now
Athos turns back to the balcony
Rochefort lobs a taunt
Are you refusing to serve your King
We are refusing to serve the Cardinal
Same thing, these days
France has one King too many

Tell his Emminence the Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the King
From enemies across the sea

Rochefort picks it up with glee

But can't promise he'll be pleased
Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows beat
The Musketeers regard each other
Well, if we're going to be outlaws,  suppose we'll have to get our affairs in order
Are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference

Merchants gossip and call to each other from shop doors
Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along the crowded boulevard

and drift from taverns and public houses
'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm
He sees the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters

'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm

As an outlaw 'll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal's guards, a refugee
Think of all the places you can hide me
'm thinking of them now

He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water all over Porthos where he stands
'Artagnan doesn't notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled , blocking the lane
Fellow travelers shout complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an obscene gesture
It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam
'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis- tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley

(not a glimmer of a grin) Do you know where this sash comes from
' No
It is a gift from the Queen of America
Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than his knowledge of current affairs
'Artagnan corrects
' There is no Queen of America

There's always some kid who thinks he's hot with a sword
some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great Porthos

'Artagnan gives him a blank look

He sputters with rage

But when you started talking about Original Sin,  lost control and became impassioned
It won't happen again
There's nothing unholy about expressing one's emotions
On the contrary
Religion should be experienced in a passionate, all- embracing way
We should feel free to express our spirituality
Yes, darling
The Damsel attacks him again
Suddenly, a pounding on the door

But Aramis' heart is too noble
He gets down on his knees
First we must pray to God for forgiveness
That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband, an irate  enters with a pistol
His eyes blaze with madness
He aims the pistol at Aramis' head
On second thought, God's often busy

As they untangle themselves and get up

You broke my fall perfectly
But  do apologize for the inconvenience

Twin thrones occupy a raised dais
An entire wall is covered with a spectac- ular map of the world
The map contains every known country and continent, including the New World
The exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom
Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber
And for the first time, she looks and acts her age
Barely a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings and queens who came before her
And a long way from home
Anne steps to the great map of the world
She reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a pang of separation
We hear: (
) Your Majesty
Anne reacts with a start
tall, powerfully built man stands in the shadows, a spectre in red
Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised me
Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness
He smiles
How was your ride
Richelieu's question takes her by surprise
He bows before Anne

It is a matter of State
But rest assured, your secret is safe with me
His manner is both charming and paternal
Anne, smart enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings, is nonetheless touched by his concern
Thank you
Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently
You're homesick

Is that the same thing
Sometimes
Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: Austria's loss is France's gain
'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion
Nonsense
He's young, not blind
Mostly, he is absent

May  advise you
He says it with seeming humility, not condescension
Anne nods assent
Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated
He lost his childhood forever that day
have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands
boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man
He is shy, yet boastful
Giving, yet stubborn
But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is
The boy who lost his father
Or the King of France
But how can
Flatter him
Make the boy feel like a King
So that the King may be your husband
Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply
when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull boom, the Seneschal chants: His Majesty, the King
The Seneschal steps aside as   enters
He is surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan
His face is handsome and intelligent
Your Majesty
Cardinal Richelieu, 've been looking for you

Her presence catches him off guard
Oh
Anne
Hello
didn't know you were here
Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love, behind a formal veneer
Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's confidences, replies: Would you like me to go
Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here
Determin- ation breeds a more capable attitude
No
Please, stay

And the Cardinal surprises with quiet humor: She scares me too
As do all women who join beauty to intelligence

Long blonde curly hair that cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes, and skin as white as alabaster
She is known as She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence

The carriage, the beautiful woman inside it
Paris wraps its arms around the young man's heart
Suddenly: a second face enters the carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast

As she places the comb we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm
She pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark and cold
Milady does not move from the reflecting glass, she smiles
Count de Winter

To pay for what you did to my son

Athos takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles , and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once
'Artagnan looks for an opponent
and finds himself face to face with Jussac
The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix- ture of styles and techniques
Athos is a brutal swords- man, his strokes overpowering and savage
His repertoire also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional elbow when necessary
Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas
And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, Porthos
He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master
Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a one- man wrecking crew of epic proportions
'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar
He bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver- sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac- rity
Jussac is having a hard time defending himself against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all directions at once
(losing patience) Stand still
How do you expect me to kill you if you keep jumping around

He produces a pair of nunchucks
Biscarat looks at the odd weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion
and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks him to the ground
(eyes on the tower) Damn monks
Always spoiling everybody's fun
Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next
They are nearer to God
They're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword
Pagan
Papist
Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents
He'd rather bicker from close range
But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber
Porthos sees him, sighs
(to Aramis) Excuse me
'm fine, thank you
And Porthos returns to his original foe
Meanwhile, Athos' heavy strokes take their toll
Cahusac staggers, wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls to the ground with a thud
Aramis calls out to him, indicates d'Artagnan: Take a look at our young friend
You mean he's still alive
Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out of Jussac
Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's sword like a snake and runs him through

He is dead
Athos and Aramis react, impressed
Then turn their full attention on weakening foes
They disarm and disable them with swift strokes
Meanwhile, Porthos chases Biscarat into a grove of trees
The Guard has discovered the better part of valor, now runs for his life
Porthos -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head
Biscarat hears the odd  sound, turns to face him
The color drains from his face
Now what
Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about the neck, the balls slam into his head
The Guard drops to the ground without a sound

'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his breath

Last rites
Aramis takes death very seriously
Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a pouch under his cloak
'Artagnan sees the other weapons there, including a boomerang

All for one, and one for all
'Artagnan beams
Don't encourage him
By killing Jussac, the boy's made himself an outlaw too
Not if he leaves Paris
Which is exactly what he's going to do
' can't leave

Go home, find a wench, live long and prosper
' Why can't  stay with you
Aramis and Porthos look to Athos
As always, he will decide
Because  do not want you to
It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy
or he simply doesn't give a damn
Whatever the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen
The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone
know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly, but don't let that fool you
He really is cold and unfriendly
But he's also right
This is our fight, not yours
Go on, get out of here
' Whatever happened to the motto of the Musketeers
'All for one, and one for all
' Wake up, boy
The Musketeers are just a dream

Aramis and Porthos follow
d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers grow small in the distance
Then, sadly, he steps to his horse, climbs into the saddle
It has been both the best and the worst day of his young life
That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by Rochefort himself
They see their wounded comrades, Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the distance
(pointing) There they go
After them
But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase, d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy of the blue and gold
' (defiant) Long live the Musketeers
And d'Artagnan draws his saber
The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to d'Artagnan's bold charge
(with admiration) Do you believe this kid
'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them
He races through   like a demon possessed
Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword
(shouts to the others) Fall back
'll take him myself
And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort meet in the middle of the field

He hits the ground with a painful    thud
Rochefort's Guards leap towards him

Rochefort's got the boy
(seemingly unmoved) Too bad
You can't just leave him
Athos spurs his horse, rides away
Aramis and Porthos exchange sad looks and hopeful comments
He has a plan
Definitely
plan
And with that, they gallop after

This boy fights like a wildcat

The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his sword

'Artagnan is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted floor
The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest
'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action
As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux
He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches for his own
But it is gone
' My sword -- It's magnificent
Where did you get it
Rochefort steps  , the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'Artagnan's sword in his hands

Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then
Well now it belongs to me collect swords

But Rochefort raises the sword, points it at his throat
'Artagnan freezes, feels the sharp tip of the blade

'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged in the Crusades
He nods, gestures for Rochefort to come closer
As if to impart a secret
Rochefort tilts downward, d'Artagnan rises up
and whispers
' Give me my father's sword, and 'll cut out your heart
Bold words, bad timing
Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'Artagnan's head
The youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious
Fool
Like your father
Rochefort storms from the cell
He nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall
The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan, inert in a shallow puddle of foul water
He lifts, drags him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open, the jailer reacts with surprise, and

Two jailers con- verse, step towards him
'Artagnan leaps into a cell doorway, allows them to pass
Suddenly: scabrous hands reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat
He shudders, leaps free
And continues
'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth
Frustrated, no way out
Just      then: more  heading toward him
'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps      , accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers
'Artagnan thinks fast
and joins them

He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out
But the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine wooden door
'Artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing
Cardinal Richelieu, a fear- some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France
'Artagnan's jaw drops
The cloaked figure steps inside
The jailers disperse
'Artagnan takes steps as if to join them
then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it
53                                         53 The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal
Richelieu smiles, concupiscent
Rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment

The figure rises
The hood falls back

54                                                    54 'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it unlocked
He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear close
55                                                    55 Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve, and hands it to Milady

An alliance with Buckingham
The King left me no choice
Now that he's come of age, the boy believes he should rule France
Instead of me
Rochefort knows what this portends
He steps from the corner
You're going to go through with everything

Everything

Rochefort hisses: On your knees
When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a mighty kick
'Artagnan scrambles into the correct posture of supplication
Rochefort continues: This is the boy who killed Jussac
' can explain that -- Silence
Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to the floor
The Cardinal frowns
Rochefort
Violence solves nothing
Leave him to me
'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone
Rochefort makes a sullen exit
The Cardinal smiles
Please
Sit down
'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his first movie star
He sits in a finely brocaded chair, looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red
The Cardinal speaks, his manner casual, friendly
How much did you hear

You may have many talents, my young friend
But guile is not one of them
Do you have a name
' 'Artagnan
've heard that name before
Are you a Gascon
' Yes, Your Eminence
Tell me
What brought you to Paris
And don't say 'a horse
' ' came to join the King's Musketeers
Bad timing
' So 've heard
'Artagnan,  like you
could use a capable young man like you in my Guards
' 'm honored, Your Eminence, but don't think  would be very popular with the other men
Not after today
suppose not
Your heart is set on being a Musketeer
(off his look) When  was your age,  too had dreams of joining the Musketeers
' (surprised) You, Your Eminence

58   :    (2)                                              58 Why not
Becoming a Musketeer is the fantasy of every young Frenchman
Or should  say it was
(with seeming kindness, reason) Like the Knights of the Round Table, the Musketeers have outlived their usefulness
They are a thing of the past
(beat) And so have your three friends
Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan, and  will spare your life
Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice
'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly
No longer in awe, but in opposition
' 'm sorry
But  can't tell you what  do not know
In that case, give my regards to the headsman
' What about my trial
You've just had it
Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him
'Artagnan calls after
' Wait -- Why
Do you object to losing your head
' Yes
like it where it is
Then tell me what  want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer
(beat) Where are the three Musketeers

And if you did
' (after a beat) wouldn't tell you
admire your courage, young man
You might have made a fine Musketeer after all
Richelieu opens the door
Rochefort waits on the other side
But we'll never know, will we
Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor
This time Richelieu does not utter protest
Instead, he turns to the Captain, commands: Find the three Musketeers and kill them
They'll be dead by dawn
comforting thought
Good night, d'Artagnan
Enjoy it
Morning comes quickly
With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark d'Artagnan for a beat

The Guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities
The coachman remains, seated on top, braiding his whip

'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be- neath the brim of his broad black hat
He holds a large Bible in his hands
For we are with you, always
The Priest raises his face, reveals it
and winks
It is Aramis
He whispers: All for one, and one for all
'Artagnan's heart soars
He turns to face the execu- tioner
Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang
Prepare the prisoner
Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a threatening manner
He takes him by the scruff of the neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block
The crowd goes wild

You won't feel a thing
The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look
Where is Father Rostand today
The good father is
all tied up
Very well

She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe
But Constance freezes in   place, eyes wide
As d'Artagnan, upon the cart, rolls
It's him
For just a moment, their eyes lock
Inestimable space between
Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'Artagnan
Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises his axe
'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a silent prayer
That's when screams of panic erupt from the crowd
'Artagnan raises his head to see the source of this mayhem

Men shout, women scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves, the coach's  spinning
In the driver's seat, clutching the reins in one hand and  a in the other

Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate box
Hello
Aramis opens the box, reacts
It is filled with gold coins, jewelry
How is it that a man of God becomes a man of gold

Would you be so good as to distribute these
Your generosity will be greatly appreciated
' (open the box, reacts) But

The people are hungry
'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into the air
Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the carriage interior
Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and leap after

He    steps out of a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be- loved carriage
He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a long beat

The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall
'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts
' All my mother would tell me is that he died in the service of the King
An uncomfortable silence
It is Athos who finally speaks: 'Artagnan, your father and another Musketeer were ambushed and murdered outside the Louvre
'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent
He manages a broken whisper: ' This other Musketeer -- is he still alive
'd like to talk to him
Athos shakes his head
Porthos adds: You already have
His name is the Count De Rochefort
'Artagnan isn't listening
He stands suddenly, turns, and walks away
He doesn't want the Musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes

Athos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a single word
All turn, wonder

' Yes

Suddenly: pounding     come over the scene
And galloping out    of the fog come d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather
this heroic tableau for    a long beat

They are armed with muskets and swords

And the sound of  is heard in the distance
Faint, but growing closer
Shoot low
We'll need their heads for identification
The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim
Right on cue, four horsemen come  out of the mist
But just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to the right
Before the Mercenaries realize what's happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing through the shallow stream
In a flash, they return to the road, and race away
Having avoided the bridge completely
Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about,  at d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into the night
Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them

Beer kegs litter the roadway
The wagon's driver, an old , sits on one of the kegs, holding his head
'Artagnan and the Musketeers gallop  , rein their horses to a stop
(with relief) Thank God for a friendly face
My horse broke loose
Can you help me move these kegs out of the road
'Artagnan starts to dismount
Stay on your horse
' He needs our help
Don't worry
We'll help him
Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing muskets
The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls out a pistol, makes a smirking request: () 69

Musketeers
Gentlemen,  beg you
Please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road
We'd prefer to ride on without having to kill you
'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise
You're threatening us
It's not a threat, it's a fact
If you don't haul those kegs away, you're dead where you stand
The Farmer laughs, contemptuously
He raises his pistol and aims it at Porthos' head
But before he can pull the trigger,    from under the cloaks of Athos, Porthos and Aramis
When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the Musketeers
Mine hit the ground first
Mine was taller
Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform last rites over the bodies
'Artagnan still can't be- lieve what just happened
He turns to Porthos
Porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke
There's only one rule, d'Artagnan -- stay alive

Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to meet the four ominous travelers
Good evening
See to our horses and bring us some food
(apologetic) 'm sorry but we have little to spare
The Cardinal's Guards were here today
They helped themselves to our food and then refused to pay
(bitter) In the name of God, 'm sure
Porthos is on the lookout for danger
He reaches inside his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally exposes his Musketeer tunic

The sound of   as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight
They stand back to back in a circle, ready for attack
But there is no attack
Quite the contrary

Gentlemen, put away your swords and come in
Anyone who fights the Cardinal is welcome here
The Musketeers lower their swords

The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and take off their dripping hats and capes
The pretty Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car- ry it to the fire
We don't have much but what we have is yours
Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself
He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly voice
Ladies, you're in for a treat tonight
Allow me to introduce myself
'm the Musketeer they call Porthos
Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing happens
The Barmaids look at each other
(repeating; louder) Porthos
Still no response
Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles
It's hard to believe they haven't heard of the great Porthos
Oh, shut up, Aramis
The three Barmaids perk up
(with excitement) Aramis
Did you say Aramis
And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis
Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair

-                                            83 Moments later
Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale
said, ' Queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark
Though less
practiced in the arts of pleasure
' The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee
But d'Artagnan isn't so sure
Porthos, with two Barmaids, bellows a reply
If you're going to be a proper Musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching
Right, ladies
The Barmaids heartily concur
'Artagnan looks over Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ- ously
Porthos follows his gaze, grins
Ahh, very good
Your first subject
But you'll need instruction
Watch closely
Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings her lips toward his
The secret to wenching is the first kiss
For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made
If it is weak, she will think you are weak
And if it is comical, she will think you are a clown
With me
' Weak
weak
Comical
clown
Very good
And as a Musketeer is never weak,  and only rarely a clown, your  first kiss must be all the things  that you are
Like this
Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss
He breaks it, turns to d'Artagnan with a grin
() 73
83   :                                                    83 You may speak first if you like, your name, her name, an endearment or two
But words are usually a waste of time
Only if you don't know which words to say
All turn to regard Aramis
He'll play along too
Porthos reacts with delight
'Artagnan with interest
Aramis continues: Words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses
(still reeling) Not likely
'll demonstrate
Please
Sit beside me
Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en- virons as it is persuasive
The Barmaid slips from Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him
Aramis does not touch her
He simply looks into her eyes
and begins to speak
'Shall  compare thee to a summer's day
Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer's leash hath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimmed; And every fair from fair sometimes declines, By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed; But thy eternal summer shall not fade

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee
' The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently
Her face covered with tears
Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by the outcome
He turns to d'Artagnan, cites: Shakespeare
That's cheating
The Barmaid on his lap disagrees
It's beautiful
'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the room
Porthos urges him on
Come on, d'Artagnan
We haven't got all night
'Artagnan steps forward
The dark-haired Barmaid sees him coming and smiles
'Artagnan stands before her, hesitates, not sure where to start
Then, remembering as best he can: ' 'Shall  compare thee to a summer's day
Thou are move lovely and more tempest, er, more tempered
' (beat) Ahh, to hell with it -- 'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a powerful kiss
As previously demonstrated
Porthos and Aramis smile proudly

'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle of Burgundy
In all the years 've know him

' Why is he sitting by himself
Athos takes his drinking seriously
Ignore him
He'll be his usual warm, charming self by morning

My lap is cold
Barmaid scurries
Porthos grabs her by the waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his lap
The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily

He stares at d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond
As if to look into another time and place
Finally: Love

Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain he keeps inside

It was the only article of clothing she refused to remove

' What
The fleur d'lis
She'd been branded

The Count's angel turned out to be a murderess who escaped the Executioner's blade
She swore that she loved him
Swore that she had changed
And if he would just keep her secret, they would live a long life together
Athos pauses, imagines that life
The Count and his angel
But the Count was young and he was stupid
He was tormented by the ridicule of his social class
And so he rejected her
For her lies and for her past
(beat) And turned her over to the authorities to be executed for the crime

Aramis launches into something appropriate
Porthos and a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance

Every once in awhile, another  -- a dagger or something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the floor with a
That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to the floor
Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up
Athos, totally unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle

And could not in good conscience wait another minute
You want my help
Yes
On what matter
Your
husband
(remembering Richelieu's last encounter with Louis) Your King
Richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful
Anne resumes, chooses her words with care
Of course
As Your Eminence has been kind enough to advise me
(nods assent) It's the least  can do
Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure
He steps closer

Why
He feels it is not
appropriate
It sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters
Which is exactly why we must celebrate
(off her look) To show the world that the King of France is strong enough to face any enemy on any field
To show France
that he is King
(beat) He will listen to you
If you will speak
Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming loyalty
Anne considers, replies, noncommittal: will speak to him
Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface
The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb her
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Of course
Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers
Richelieu calls after

His mood glum and lonely
He sighs, moves on to another matter of business
Your Eminence, 've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you
Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned
There are so many to choose from
Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham
Let's see if  remember it correctly
While the English attack from without, 'll undermine the throne from within -- depose you -- and become sovereign of France myself

It does seem rather farfetched

It travels from one shore to the other by means of a ferry rope
Transport is slow, the trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes
As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re- turning, piloted by its , a hunched and weather- beaten gnome
Four passengers wait to be carried across --    on horseback, and a country and her child
As the flatboat enters its slip, the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely jostling the Woman and her child to the rear
The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss to his way

The Woman reacts with grateful surprise
The Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and protests
Nobody rides for free
Under your protection bloody well indeed
'll teach you a thing or two about protection
Apple- cheeked young fools
-- Just who do you think you are
(waits for the tirade to cease; simply) Musketeers
Two two Cavaliers react to the word
The Ferryman does, too -- into cringing, obedient servant

Well, why didn't you say so
Of course you'll ride for free

This way, pretty madame
My what a lovely little girl
Porthos
What
Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the hill on their horses
We sail
And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom- erang and brings it down on the dock rope
The rope splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock
95                                                  95 The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of the dock but they're too late

Aramis ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them for the crossing
Then he turns around and sees what Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them with keen interest
You're those Musketeers everyone's been looking for
Popularity has its price
The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask

We'd be happy to
Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak

There are those who would call that treason
Happily, no such objections have been raised

Which is to say, that most muddy-brained of all men

The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords
Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own
Porthos deadpans: Maybe there's something  about us that just pisses people  off
At least 'd like to think  so
It's too bad we can only kill  them once

But the combatants make the most of it
Slipping, sliding, and falling
They attack with everything they've got
The Cavaliers are excellent swordsmen
And, as if that were not enough, the Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades

Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re- ducing his opponent to tatters
At one juncture, the child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of the flatboat, the deep river beyond
Aramis executes a neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with one arm while continuing to do battle with the other
He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues
The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the flatboat deck
Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle, breathless
Porthos complains: 've been called a lot of things in my time
(eyes on the opposite shore) Porthos
But beef-witted is a little more than  can stand, not to mention unfair

Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it
There, waiting patiently, swords and muskets already drawn

Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit
They leap atop their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they guide them to the    edge
You go first and 'll watch your progress
No, no
Please
After you
Stalemate
Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos grin
Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest
They count
One, two -- three
And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging river
The Woman whispers after: Thank you
God speed
Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance

They lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land
and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of Cardinal's Guards
Waiting, swords drawn, for their arrival

The forest around them is dark and primeval

He promised to take me on my tenth birthday

Something about a boy becoming a man
'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us
But he died before  could go with him
Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem

grazes d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount
Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at the top
The climb is fast and treacherous,  all around them
Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag- gers forward
and collapses just as they reach the crest
'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with Athos behind the boulders
Athos takes aim,  a , and kills one of the horsemen below
The others curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover back and forth like angry hornets

They are badly outnumbered
The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to tree

That Athos cannot fully express it
And that there is no use arguing with him

' Musketeers are not afraid of anything

knew you were a Musketeer the moment  saw you
' You did
Of course
(with sudden concern) But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger
' Musketeer is not afriad of danger
'm dangerous
You're not afraid of me
Her tone heralds a sudden shift
'Artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him
But he resists
There is Constance's memory to consider
And midnight as it approaches
' You're not dangerous
Then what am

beautiful
Milady covers him with caresses
'Artagnan resists slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied
Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of his jaw
Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against the silk beneath it
Milady speaks as her      finger traces
Beauty, danger
They are the same
And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory comb
111    '                                                  111 He cannot continue
Constance, the hour, a confusion he cannot deny
' 'm sorry -- 'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a dagger, attached to an ivory comb
'Artagnan sees it in the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking the dagger to the rug
Milady leaps after it, hands out- stretched
'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger, stunned with fear and surprise: ' What're you doing
Have you lost your mind
You came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England
'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge
Milady is the messenger he is seeking
He grabs the dagger, rolls to the side
Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her negligee rips open
'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh, reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of the fleur de lis
The infamous mark of the murderess
Just as Athos told it to him
Not so long ago
' My God

The chamber door flies open
Henri and Parker, the Indo- Chinese bodyguard, appear
Parker faces d'Artagnan with a half-smile
He holds out his hands, both empty
And steps toward him
'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand
Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un- fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps forward to meet him
Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows
The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the martial arts
Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet, dazed
Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions
Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair, and commands: Kill him
Parker holds him fast
Henri steps forward
And d'Artagnan thinks fast
' You can kill me
But a surprise waits for you in England
That even Buckingham can't prevent
(stops Henri with a gesture) What
surprise
' That's one thing 'll never tell you
'Artagnan
You are young, vain, and foolish
But  do not know if you are clever
'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing
Except to suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping
Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes her mind
We'll take him with us

It is a long voyage
Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty
: 112
-     -                  112 Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel
She is followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed
He is flanked by Henri and Parker
Henri presses the blade of a knife against d'Artagnan's side
The bodyguards are waiting outside
Milady leads them down the hall
But when she reaches the landing, and looks at the tavern below
she draws back with surprise
113                                   113 The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night- shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris
The innkeeper shakes his   head
Armand grabs him by the collar
'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience, and just a hint of fear
Milady commands: The back stairs
Hurry
They change directions
As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below
: 114
-                                              114 Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds away in the direction of the harbor
In the driver's seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward
Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback
: 109
115
-                                      115 'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady
Her face betrays faint doubt,  apprehension
Emotions she is not used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around her
'Artagnan sees   his opening
and speaks: ' The man at the inn
what did he want
(hollow laugh) Justice
Honor
Revenge
' Why
He is the brother of my late husband, Lord de Winter
He blames me for de Winter's death
He thinks  murdered him
' Did you murder your husband, Milady
What do you think

'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face
Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss
' think he's not the first husband you killed
(off her look) once knew a man, one of the Counts of Berry
He told me a story
of beauty and danger
He was the bravest man 've ever known
And the saddest
know
The truth strikes home
Milady cannot conceal it
But she does not react with anger or scorn
'Artagnan has reminded her of the one thing in the world that still touches her heart
'Artagnan looks at her with a steady gaze
Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage window
: 110
116
-                                         116 Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to the harbor
The fog is so thick that only the masts of the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom
Their lanterns glow gloomily
The carriage comes to a stop
: 117
-                               117 The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog
We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier
Henri helps Milady out of the carriage
'Artagnan follows
Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them
motley bunch of sinister killers
They look around the pier, ready for any encounter
'Artagnan takes in his surroundings
There is a mel- ancholy air about him
What's the matter, d'Artagnan
Still hoping for your friends to ride to the rescue
' My friends are dead
Well
If it's any consolation, you'll soon be joining them
Milady's return to form does not surprise
Parker shoves d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship

Persephone

-                                           118 Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to the soupy darkness of her deck
We are the Countess de Winter's party, arrived from Paris
Permission to come aboard
There is no reply
Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan strains to see

Milady nods to Henri
He steps up the narrow gangplank, followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six bodyguards
: 119
-                               119 The deck is filled with swirling fog
Henri peers into the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others
He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing nearby
Take us to your captain
The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move
Henri demands: What are you, deaf
Henri goes to shake the man
He grabs his arm, and the man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck
Henri jumps back in alarm
Milady and the others react
What is this
Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the other silent silhouettes
They, like the tall figure
are dead
The limp bodies topple at their touch
The Bodyguards shout alarm and panic: Dead
They're all dead
(
) Well  certainly hope so
After all that hard work
That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down from above like avenging angels
They swing on the ends of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet first on top of Milady's Bodyguards
'Artagnan stands open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords
(calling to him) You look like you've seen a ghost

Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters
heroic tale of love, death, and Musketeers
Suitable for the general public
Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as he goes
All right then
All those who wish to die, raise your hands
Don't by shy, there's plenty to go around
'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray
And finds himself face to face with Parker, the Indo-Chinese bodyguard
Parker has two Oriental swords spinning in his hands
One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out of his hand
'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck
As Parker is about to chop d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword
In the mist Athos is revealed
Sorry 'm late
Did  miss anything
'Artagnan almost cries with happiness
He leaps to his feet and embraces Athos
' thought you were dead
Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan
He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray
'Artagnan follows
The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards in the night and fog
Athos with brutal perfection
Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the absurd
And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry -- and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his opponents
Milady views the latter with alarm
As the battle rages around her, she retreats into the shadows

Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown
Boy, it's a miracle you're still alive fighting like that
' What do you mean
First, always find your enemy's weakness
Second, take advantage of it
Watch me
One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks Athos
Athos kicks the false leg out from under him, knocks him to the deck
'Artagnan repeats, even as he disables his own foe
' Find the weakness
Take advantage
Got it
Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last rites
Bodyguard races  , means to kill him where he kneels
Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts, rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the ship to the water below

And Aramis resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany

The two Sailors stop in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition
Porthos the Pirate
With a collective "yah
" the two Sailors drop their daggers, and flee into the foggy night
Porthos looks about to see if anyone noticed their exit
'Artagnan grins nearby

Privateer
There's a difference
Every Musketeer is running from something or someone
'Artagnan deadpans: ' love a good sea story
Do tell me sometime
Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest
But before he can reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray

Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders
And at that moment, sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse light
Milady
Time stops as they regard each other across the deck, the battle between
No
Milady turns and runs into the night
Athos races after

-                                              124 With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off
Athos appears moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse
And gives chase
: 125
-                                       125 Milady whips her horse, drives it onward
But Athos overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms
They fall to the ground with a crash
Milady grabs the deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle
Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his side
Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half- light
And lowers the dagger
She will not kill him
Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest
But Athos stands and shouts: Stop
Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him
Athos holds his musket in a steady hand
very long beat
Milady takes a step closer
Finally, she whispers, with love, with hate: Athos
How did you do it, Sabine
How did you come back from the dead

No, Count
You were too proud to listen to the truth

Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the past and what it brings
Give me the Cardinal's treaty
No
Then  will shoot
Athos cocks the trigger
Milady whispers: Be kind
And aim for my heart
Athos' face is a mask of contradiction
He tries to pull the trigger, but it is not in him
Milady recognizes his pain with a nod
She feels it, too
Then, briefly, before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly
The past, their love, and where it led them
remember
everything
She turns and runs away
directly into the arms of Armand de Winter
He has ridden, and he has followed, and he has finally found her here

What about the King
He is not mentioned directly
But the agreement is contingent on a 'demonstration' of the Cardinal's power
' demonstration

He has been silent throughout

Milady sits beside it in a chair, staring into the glowing embers
Their hot re- flection dances in her pale blue eyes
There is a at the door
Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner of the room where he has been standing guard with an impassive executioner
He crosses to the door, opens it
And Athos steps inside
'd like a word with your prisoner

Milady turns, looks up to face him
There was a time when  would've given my life for a kind word

Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze
Athos indicates Armand in the corner
Did you kill his brother and his father as he says
(a long beat, honest at the last) have become
the nightmare you once thought me to be
But not before
Not us

Yes
Tell me
Will you spare my life

On the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds, surreal in effect
sinister procession approaches the cliff
Porthos leads Milady
She wears a simple white shift, her hair pulled back into a long braid
She looks years younger, the girl she used to be
The Executioner walks behind them
Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis, d'Artagnan
And Athos
He watches every step
The procession stops at the cliff's edge
Lightning slashes the sky
The Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her
The Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his cloak
Milady catches Athos' eye
He holds her gaze
He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until the day he dies

Die in peace
Athos repeats, whispers: Die in peace
Aramis comes forward, intones: am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the Lord
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of dawn
On your knees
Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer
The tableau silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon
The Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck, exposing the soft white skin beneath
He raises the scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it down
a cry is heard, torn from the heart: No
Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the scimitar loose
It falls to the ground
What's this
Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos
Athos -- But Athos breaks free

Milady locks eyes with him
Athos' desperate act, the pure feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release
And the strength to face her fate
The Cardinal intends to assassinate the King at his birthday celebration on Friday
And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle kiss
Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned, uncertain
she takes a backward step, finds the cliff's edge
and steps over it
The Executioner rushes to look after
The others follow
Except for Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the distant horizon

Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and Queen pass
Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks on from the sidelines, smiles
The King and Queen proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet
They look
happy
Hungry, more likely
Still, you were right about the celebration
And when the Cardinal told me how much it meant to you
said nothing
But
The Cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you
Both pause to consider the manipulation

-                                         139 Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession, he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks quietly, to himself: 'm not sure which is sadder
to die so young
Or to die a King
Richelieu turns from the procession
Speaks to Rochefort who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him
France will not go wanting
new King will sit on the throne
The true King after all
He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within reach
Then, as if to reassure: () 125
139   :                                                    139 Is everything ready
Yes, Your Eminence
Are you sure
'd stake my life on it, Your Eminence
(a dark beat) Rest assured, Captain
You have

-                           140 The balcony has been colorfully decorated
The crowd focuses its attention on the empty space where the King will soon appear
Below, the entrance to the Palace is protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards, resplendent in their crimson tunics
It would take an army to get past them
: 141
-                                      141 The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with people, all pushing and straining to get closer
'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback, are forced to dismount
They push through the crowd, trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too late
Athos barks orders as they struggle forward: (to d'Artagnan) Look through the surrounding area
We'll try to reach the King
' But
Go
Athos and the others press on
'Artagnan, a little disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the buildings that loom overhead
Then he starts, reacts with shock and surprise

142   ''                                             142 The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is clear
The man is not a monk
And he is carrying a musket in his hands
143                                                    143 'Artagnan turns to alert the Musketeers
Too late, they have already vanished into the throng
'Artagnan takes off running for the monastery
144                                                          144 the swelling scene
The marksman assumes a crouching position, raises his musket, and trains it on the empty balcony where the King is soon to appear
: 145
-      -               145 Louis and Anne continue toward the balcony
Richelieu trails the royal couple
He nods to Rochefort in passing
They exchange significant smiles
Anne spots the smirk on Rochefort's face
He resumes a supplicant pose
Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them
do not trust him
'm not sure who to trust
Then we will discover the truth together
Louis likes the sound of that
They step side by side toward the balcony
: 146
-                                           146 Bell ropes, hundreds of feet long, dangle down the vertiginous shaft
'Artagnan races up the narrow, circular stairs
Above him is the open trap to the bell tower
He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back turned, taking aim
: 127
147                                                 147 Athos, Porthos, and Aramis push their way through the crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace entrance
But the throng is impenetrable
Athos turns, wonders
And shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux, looming against the sky, as if to intuit the danger lurking there
: 148
-  -                                148 Louis and Anne lead the procession to the doors of the balcony
The crowd roars and the
The King steps into the sunlight
The Queen follows, then Richelieu
The three most important people in France stand together, acknowledging the clamoring multitudes
149
-                                      149 The marksman takes careful aim
The cheering down below is like a faint whisper at this altitude
The marksman cocks the hammer of his flinklock
: 150
-                                         150 'Artagnan hears the click of the musket's hammer, and knows he must act now
He  looks around and sees his chance
'Artagnan leaps  off the stairs and grabs a handful of rope, using his weight to  the overhead

-                                     153 Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance, draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of Guards protecting the doors
The Guards cannot believe what they are seeing
Three men against a hundred
It's ridiculous
But then
the looks on Guards' faces begin to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror
154                                                       154 Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible happens
Musketeers appear from every direction
Some from the surrounding crowd
Some from buildings, roof- tops
Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as monks
And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold tunics
The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar
The corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis
Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile
Athos keeps his usually dour expression
But his eyes are charged with excitement
They raise their arms, and face the long line of Guards
hundred sabers flash in the sunlight
Save the King
The Musketeers charge
It is a glorious sight
: 155
-                                      155 'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles the marksman
As the    , they fight hand-to-hand
The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the edge of the tower
Two hundred feet to the ground below
They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him
And at the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound- ing kick
The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor, and plunges to his death
'Artagnan peers down the shaft
There's a faint as the marksman hits bottom
Utilizing the bell ropes like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides down into the abyss

156
-                      156 Pandemonium reigns
Rochefort instructs his Guards to close the huge door to the great hall
The members of the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced the palace is under seige
Constance pauses amid the riot, seeks the Queen
But Richelieu has found her first
He steps to Anne, assumes an air of priestly innocence
Your Majesty
But Louis steps  , puts a protecting arm around his wife, speaks stern command: Leave us
alone
That's when a loud  rocks the room
157                                                 157 The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific blow
Another  and the great hall is plunged into further chaos
The regiment of Guards rush forward, press their bodies against the door to secure it
-- the great door threatens to split in half
Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic
His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis and Anne across the room
(a cold whisper) Kill him
Kill her, too
Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath
He advances on Louis and Anne
Louis has witnessed the latter, treason confirmed
He raises his own sword, prepared to protect his Queen
To die for her if necessary
(to Anne) Get behind me
Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King
But one last  and the great  comes  down on the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other side
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead
() 130
157   :                                                 157 Louis breaks into a wide grin
The Musketeers wade into the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat- tlefield
Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him
Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops
Are we interrupting
Not for long
Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel
158                                                        158 Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack
But the young King has no intention of being protected
He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his Musketeers
Anne watches him with a host of emotions
Respect, admiration
love
Louis pauses to return her gaze, then returns to battle
Constance dashes through the fray
She sees a Guard slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen
She grabs a heavy goblet, shouts: Look out
Anne looks up
Constance tosses the goblet to her
Anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless Guard
Constance smiles, leaps forward
Aramis cuts down a Guard
As another man comes at him from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through
The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks, and continue
Athos and Rochefort slash at each other
It is a mighty confrontation
But Athos soon gains the upper hand
Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help
Now it's two on one
Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he staggers
and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor
Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the treaty, stuffs it into his doublet
Athos shakes off the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard
Rochefort and Athos face each other a second time
Athos wounded, Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer
But Athos merely changes sword hands
Rochefort reacts
Their   as they draw together
Rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand
But Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the face with his fist

158   :                                                    158 Rochefort goes sprawling
He loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone's foot stops it
Rochefort looks up
and sees d'Artagnan standing on the blade
' This sword belongs to me
'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword
He tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it neatly
Athos watches from a short distance, knows this moment belongs to d'Artagnan
He will not intervene
But he shouts: 'Artagnan
Kill him where he stands
These are d'Artagnan's words
son vowing to avenge the death of his father
'Artagnan wonders
Rochefort confirms
By all means
Let's discover if you are as brave a man as your father was
And as foolish
' (stunned by the revelation as it unfolds) What
He died for his King and for France
But most of all
he died on the end of my sword
(the final curse) As will you
Rochefort smiles a taunt
'Artagnan raises his sword, whispers to heaven
' This is for you, Father
Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining chamber
159                                           159 in a great stone hearth
Its light pro- jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and Rochefort duel, slashing at each other

160                                                        160 Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the Cardinal's Guards
Each with his by-now familiar tradmarks
King Louis fighting beside them
161   '                                       161 They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their faces
Rochefort wears a wolfish grin
But d'Artagnan has learned his lessons well
He attacks with gusto
Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation
He cannot match the boy's vengeful steel
So he drives a knee into d'Artagnan's groin
'Artagnan falls to the floor
Rochefort means to finish him there
But d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his feet
Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent
Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall
He pins him there, stunning the youth
And hisses with superior disdain: One thing's certain
You're no Musketeer
But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice
"Always find your enemy's weakness
" He shoves a thumb into Rochefort's good eye
Rochefort stumbles backward
'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's heart
' Take it back
might
have been
mistaken
Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead
'Artagnan looks at Rochefort's blood on his sword
His father's death finally avenged
That's when he hears the  of a 'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling at Rochefort's body
extracting the treaty from his doublet
' No
Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing fireplace
As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives after to retrieve   it

'Artagnan stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot, clutching the treaty
He grins
d'Artagnan's look of triumph

-                        162 short time later
The battle is over
The Musketeers have won
On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers
Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands
'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby
Your Majesty, that document is an obvious forgery
am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three Musketeers
Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to both King and Queen
This is a complicated matter, Your Eminence, affecting both France and the crown
beat
As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude blame after all
But Louis continues with quiet author- ity, just a trace of humor
As King, and as a man
And so, until such time as  and my advisors -- (gestures toward Anne; the Musketeers) -- can determine the whole truth of the matter
invite you to await our decision in the comfort of
the Bastille
Musketeers close in around the Cardinal
He fumes, protests
You can't do this to me
'm the Cardinal of France

Shouts of "Long live the King
Long live the King
" And as King
hereby reinstate the Musketeers
tremendous cheer is heard from all
Richelieu is led from the room
He pauses in front of d'Artagnan
Congratulations, Monsieur d'Artagnan
'll be keeping an eye on you
' (unphased) Thank you, Your Eminence
'll be watching you, too
Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile
Followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him
Louis turns to the Musketeers
He indicates d'Artagnan
Is this the young man who saved my life
Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder
His name's d'Artagnan, Sire
Approach, d'Artagnan
'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and Queen
Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet
And turns to the Queen
' have something that belongs to Your Majesty
'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road
He holds it out to her
The King wonders, the Queen smiles

162   :    (2)                                            162 Thank you, d'Artagnan
But the bracelet does not belong to me
(off his look) It belongs to her
Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward,
'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time
The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance, charges between
'Artagnan slips the bracelet around her wrist
Constance kisses him on the cheek
Louis continues: 'Artagnan,  am in your debt
What can  do to repay the courage you've shown me
Anything, 'Artagnan
Whatever your heart desires
'Artagnan knows what he wants
But he is tongue-tied, unable to ask for it
Athos asks for him
Majesty, his heart has only one desire
To become a Musketeer
'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession
Louis answers with pleasure
Then kneel, d'Artagnan
'Artagnan drops to his knees
Louis lays the blade of his sword on each of his shoulders
The world is an uncertain realm, filled with danger
Truth despoiled by broken promises
Honor undermined by the pursuit of gold
Freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong
But there are those who oppose these powerful forces
Those who dedicate their lives to truth, honor, and freedom
They are a constant reminder to all of us
That such a life is not just possible, but necessary to our continued survival
As a country, as a King
These men are known as the Musketeers

162   :    (3)                                            162 As Louis speaks, 'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless images rush through his mind
His home in Gascony, Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their adventures together, the face of Milady
It's been a busy week
Rise, d'Artagnan
And join them
Musketeer
'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man in the distance
Constance smiles brightly, tears gleam in her eyes
Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround their young friend, and happily present him with the bright blue tunic of the Musketeers
They slip the tunic over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer
'Artagnan hugs each of the three
For each has given him gifts more valuable than gold
Porthos, Aramis, and last
Athos
Who, to the surprise of all who know him
smiles
Do my eyes deceive me
find it hard to believe myself
His lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched
into a smile
It was spectacular
And what teeth
'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud
' know this is a stupid question
But what exactly does a Musketeer do
Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance
They're not so sure themselves
Truth
honor
(helpfully suggests a third) And freedom

' All for one
And one for all
The curtain falls
