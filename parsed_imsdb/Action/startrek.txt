Robau does his level best to portray confidence as he is led up a walkway to

-  (we will refer to it as the )
Are you familiar with this craft
Robau regards it
Then: Who is your commander
(silence, then re: Nero) Is it him
You will speak only to me
Then ask your commander what right he has to attack a Federation vessel
That was hardly an attack
My commander will easily destroy your ship
If you do not respond to the question
Robau considers the hologram again
And what his answer might mean for the fate of his crew
've never seen it
Or any ship like it
Are you familiar with -- or better, know the location of -- Ambassador Spock
Ayel has thrown another  --  , , who appears to be 75 earth-years old

Congratulations
Spock
Off his face, we    , as Spock collects his things
As he does, three young   walk up behind him
Spock glances at them, then back to his things
presume you've prepared new insults for today
#1 Your mother lies with many men
Spock just
Tries to ignore the fact that
have no such information
#2 You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and therefore, have no place in the universe
(swallowing that too) This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me
Logic dictates you would cease by now
#1 Look
He has human eyes
They look sad, don't they
#2 Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli
And Bully #2  Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling into one of the bowls
He looks up as: #2 (') He's a traitor, you know
Your father
For marrying her
Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable -- They land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2
The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure what the hell to do -- and we  : 21 46

massive seen through the window behind him
His parents at a distance down the hall: -- where 'm from, when someone hits you, you hit back- - how is that not logical
-- Spock had no reasonable -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being tease him -- every day
physically injured -- -- Which is precisely when reason must guide his actions --  want him to embrace           above all
Vulcan, you know that
but he has to be himself-- which means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the human
source of his ostracism
-- When Vulcans get disgusted with each other, they never just walk away, do they
-- No
-- Well humans do
And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there
He turns -- sees his son down the corridor
Approaches
And we're on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes
His father stops in front of him, looming there, looking down stoically: did not mean to create conflict between you and mother
After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little
No anger in his face
Takes a seat beside his son
In marriage
conflict is
constant
Natural
(a beat) Emotions run deep within our race
In many ways, more deeply than in humans
Long ago, they nearly destroyed us
that is why we followed the teachings of Surak
Now you must choose
between you and mother
46   :                                                            46 Never, my son
But you may choose the ethic of logic
Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience
The control of feelings
so that they do not control you
They called you a traitor
(then) You suggest that  should be completely Vulcan
and yet you married a human
why
Sarek is clearly conflicted by this
But he holds steady: As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior
Marrying your mother
was logical
(Spock seems disquieted) Spock
You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny
The question you are faced with
is which path you will take
This is something only you can decide

Academic immorality by one is an assault on us all

Not
Stand
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17

Is there anything you care to say before we begin

believe  have the right to face my accuser directly

He and Kirk for the first time
It's clock-stopping
Step forward please
This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years
Spock steps up to the
President nods
Cadet Kirk
It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test
We happen to find , in the crowd, fucking pissed
Your point being
In academic vernacular, you cheated
Respectfully
Define "cheating"
To deceive by trickery
Now let me ask you something  think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it
You programmed it to be unwinnable
Mr
Kirk,  don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings
Because if 'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat
Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario -- don't believe in no-win scenarios -- 48 83   : (2)                                                      83 amongst the officers in attendance

Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson
Please, enlighten me
You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk --  captain cannot cheat death
The first punch by Spock that landed
The cockiness slips away as he senses where this is going -- " of all people
" Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not
Shit
The  card
Kirk, a mix of  and  -- How long did it take you to look that up
How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat
The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't, it's just too damn entertaining
Maybe you just don't like that  beat your test
am Vulcan
"Like" is not a verb in our vernacular
've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar
What an idiot  am for taking that personally -- Agreed
Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test

The purpose is to experience fear
Fear in the face of certain death
To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew
This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain
Kirk absorbs that
Then -- So you're telling me the point
Of the whole thing
Is to be afraid
Fear is necessary, yes
Have you taken the test, Commander Spork
Spock
As a Vulcan,  require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions
No he '
Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all but "OOOOOOHs
" But Kirk ain't fucking done yet
You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan
And 'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all
He raises that eyebrow
And Kirk sees
no matter how subtly
that he has fucking made
Smelling blood - (') And if that's the case -- What's that say about your ability to make command decisions
Well
Looks like Kirk just hit him in  fucking weak spot
And before this lovefest can continue -- 49 83   : (4)                                                   83 bursts into the  -- Kirk turns to look -- they all do -- now we're   behind the , who runs to the President, hands him a

Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is at recess until further notice -- dismissed
Everyone's on their feet,  , Kirk suddenly irrelevant
passes by him, all fucking business, but before he goes -- Cheating isn't winning

Kirk's report is accurate
We're warping into a trap-- there are Romulans waiting for us,  promise you that

She glances over, wanting to say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of his life
He looks at her, with kind eyes
And Uhura does something odd -- she  the lift
Spock looks over as she wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him
Just holding him
Kissing his face with utter tenderness and comfort, which he lets her do
and we realize, this is why the intimacy before -- this is their secret
'm so sorry
Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost

Tell me what you need

He's on the verge of some emotional release
but self- consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again: (') need for us all to continue performing admirably
He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss
The door opens and he exits

Guilt overcomes him

Awkward
Hey

The test and everything--  know it looks like  was

And 'm sorry
really am
And just hope you'll forgive me
She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed

The destruction of my home planet

When did they jump so far ahead in the arms race

Damnit, man, 'm a doctor, not a physicist -- are you suggesting they're from the future
That is what he's suggesting and  don't buy it
If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth

Knows what's gonna happen
Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable
You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold
The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the
Kelvin, culminating in the events of today -- thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party

Back to the two men, in a cave: Kirk stares at him
his mind spinning because now he believes him
The result is overwhelmingly emotional
Forgive me
emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld

"Cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions
but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan
Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve
Going back in time
you changed all our lives
Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people
seem to overlap significantly
Tell me about the rest of the crew
Chekov-- Uhura --
Tactical and Communications -- -- Sulu -- -- he's the helmsman, why
Dr
McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence
but rather, indication of a higher purpose
he'd call it a damn miracle
Yes he would
Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself
In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage

But Kirk stands -- stops him: 96 174   : (2)                                                 174 Where you came from

Back home we have a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable

As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential

you could at least act like it was a hard decision
intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet
However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, 'll gladly defer to your medical expertise

You are in fact the Mr
Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming
Yes
That's exactly what 'm talking about
How d'ya think  ended up here
got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel
He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles -- so  told my instructor could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system -- which is no big deal anyway -- but if  were so inclined  could actually do it with a lifeform
So tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle
Which
was a mistake

Dunno
Feel guilty
What if  told you your trans-warp theory was correct
That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed
And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium
haven't been stationed here that long
If such an equation had been discovered, 'da heard
The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr
Scott
is because you haven't discovered it yet
Kirk reacts
Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a bit
