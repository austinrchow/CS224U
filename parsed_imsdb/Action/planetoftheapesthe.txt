Planet of the Aples - 1967 back "   " Screenplay by Michael Wilson Based on Novel By Pierre Boulle May 5, 1967 : 05/11/67 05/16/67 05/23/67 06/09/67 06/15/67 06/22/67 07/06/67 07/27/67 1
- Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space
The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer
speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen
No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma- tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe
Over this we the voice of an astronaut
He is concluding a report
' (o
s
) So ends my last signal until we reach our destination
We are now on automatic, a mere hundred and five light years from our base
and at the mercy of com- puters
've tucked in my crew for the long sleep
'll join them presently

-   - The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the President's cabin in Air Force One
In the immediate f
g
is a console of dials and switches flanked by four chairs
Only one of the chairs is occupied
The astronaut's back is to
There is a ladder amidships which leads to an escape hatch
The after Dart of the cabin is obscured in darkness
We hear the  of a Mozart sonata emanating from a phonograph of stereotape
The astronaut is speaking into a microphone
Within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from Cape Kennedy
By our time, that is
He pauses, looking up at: 3	   - One clock is marked  , but instead of twelve numerals it has twenty-four
One of the needles is moving very slowly
The other clock is labeled  , and its units, like those of a tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands
The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second
Over this we hear: ' (o
s
) But according to Dr
Hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light, old Mother Earth has aged a few thousand years since our de- parture -- while we have scarcely aged at all
4 This is
He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and comfortable boots
He seems calm and pensive
Extracting the butt of a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then continues: It may be so
This much is probable: the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed
Hopefully, a better one
He begins to roll up his left sleeve
leave the twentieth century without regret
Who was it
Marshall
said 'Modern man is the missin 'a link between the ape and the human being
' He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one of the portholes into the astral night
One final thought -- nothing scientific, purely personal
Seen from up here, everything looks different
Time bends and space is boundless
It squashes a man's ego
He begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity
And he is nagged by a question: ahat if any- thing, will greet us on the end of man's first journey to a star
Are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we call Earth, has been graced -- or cursed -- by human life
(pause) have to doubt it
He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects it into the vein of his forearm
He continues speaking
(sardonically) That's about all
wonder if Man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the unknown
still makes war against his brother
, and lets his neighbor's children starve
Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in a drawer of the console
Well then, Earthmen:  missing link salutes you
Bless you, my descendants
Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the hypodermic
Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and looks up again at: 5 The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per second
The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105
6
- Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after section without particular effort
him, and we can now see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin
Taylor looks down at them
7-	  -    -  '
10 One of them is open
The other three are occupied by astronauts: , and
They, too, wear dungarees and boots
Dodge and Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest
Stewart is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short
Their eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make them so alive
11	  - He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into it
Continuing
as Taylor Dulls the glass lid shut and secures it
He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies back, buckling his safety belt
of Taylor
His eyes are open
He seems serene, even enraptured
(: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of time
) : 12-	    -    () 16 We see a strange and distant planet
At first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen; but with each new  it comes closer and looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent
The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own
Much of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue
We can, however, make out a few narrow "green belts" and a patch of blue water
In the   of this  we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet
It appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles
The water is blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion
(This is the Lake Powell location, at Lone Rock
) 17
-   - Four empty pilot seats are seen in f
g
, the four glass caskets in b
g
We  the   of a  , a as in a rapid descent, and perhaps the
Then, a great  as the craft hits water
The whole ship shudders on impact
Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor
the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and  on the four glass caskets
There are     as the glass domes of the caskets swing open automatically
18 He now has a full beard
His eyes come open
Instantly alert, he rises to a sitting position, gazing across at: 19	   -  '
They, too, awaken and sit up, starring at Taylor
They, too, are bearded
' (o
s
) You all right
They nod
20	   - He glances at the casket beside his own
Stewart
(struggling to his feet) Stewart
21	- -- Its dome remains unopened
The young woman is a skeleton in a Churchill suit
22	  - Dodge and Landon have joined Taylor and-stare at the grinning skull of their dead comrade
low, descending  of equipment is heard
Simultaneously the lights begin to
moment later they brighten, but not as much as before
There goes our primary power
We're on auxilliary
slight  sound is heard
Taylor turns quickly away and o
s
: 23	  - trickle of water has begun to seep through a ruptured seam in the cabin
Taylor darts to a porthole and peers cut
24	  -   : water The porthole is no more than six inches above the line
In the distance we discern a shoreline of red desert
' (o
s
) We're in the soup
We're sinking
25
- The leak in the seam becomes a growing spray of water
Taylor turns away from the porthole, calling: Dodge
Read the atmosphere
Dodge moves instantly to the ladder beneath an escape hatch and mounts it
Taylor stumbles down the aisle of the rolling ship toward the console and addresses Landon, who is still staring at Stewart's skeleton
Landon
Send a last signal
(dazed) What signal
To Earth
That we've landed
As Landon lurches toward the communications equipment in f
g
: 26
-    -   ( ,  ) We are looking at a lifeless desert of sandstone buttes and pinnacles
There is no sign of vegetation anywhere
to a body of water that could be the bay of an inland sea
The deep blue of the sea contrasts sharply to the red sands of the shoreline on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred yards offshore
The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible
The red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it
Suddenly a snorkel-like tube sprouts from the escape hatch, which is located amidships
27
- Dodge, standing halfway up the ladder
, has fastened a kit of gauges to the end of the snorkel tube
He reads the dials, removes the kit, sniffs the air in the tube and then, taking a deep breath, announces: It's breathable
' (o
s
) Okay
Blow the hatch before we lose auxilliary power
Dodge reaches for a control mechanism near the escape hatch
28 The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing
The   again and the  of the warning signal
While Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder rolling, but all we hear are scrambled and unintelligible noises
It's no use
there she goes
Forget it
Abandon ship
29	  - The escape hatch is now open
Taylor darts over to the ladder and passes a folded life raft up to Dodge
When Landon reaches the ladder, Taylor hands him two neatly packed rucksacks, and Landon climbs through the escape hatch
Taylor is about to follow with a third rucksack, then turns and crosses the cabin for a last look at: 30	   -  '
Both clocks have stopped: the red needle of the clock labeled rests on the numeral 18; the red needle of the clock marked rests on the numeral 3975
31
- Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and tosses it into the water
He and Landon jump into the water and climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips into the water and climbs onto the raft
He and Landon begin to paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and takes a sample of the water
32 (half to himself) Briny
twenty-five percent salinity
Near the saturation point
(looking back) She's still sinking
33	  -
Only the radio antenna and the tip of the tail fin remain visible
' (o
s
) Going
going
The craft vanishes beneath the water
34 Dodge is still busy with his kit
Landon is still looking back, but Taylor doesn't bother to turn his head
Gone
(flatly) We're here to stay
35	  - They gaze at the forbidding sandstone battlements as they near the shore
Well
Where are we
Have any notion, skipper
(confidently) We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth
On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion
(looks off at the "sun") That could be Bellatrix
36	  -
Low on the horizon, seen through a dense envelope of dust particles
' (o
s
) Too red for Bellatrix
37 Landon glances skeptically at Taylor
You didn't have time to check the tapes, so you don't really know, do you
(as Taylor ignores him) What went wrong
(sardonically) We weren't programmed to land in water
(grinning) The question, Landon, is not so much where we are as when we are
(stands up in raft) We've had a nice snooze
Let's start earning all our back pay
38	  - As the three astronauts step out into shallow water and pull the raft ashore
Take your soil test, Dodge
'll check the equipment
Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins to take some subsoil samplings
Taylor begins to examine the contents of the three rucksacks
Landon sits down on the beach
, hands around his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship
During this and succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous and certainly more "human," for he has many fears to control: while Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma
(calls Dodge) Got your sensors
Yo
Geiger counter
Yo
(taking inventory) One pistol
twenty-four rounds of ammo
two medical kits
one camera
one TX9
(loudly to the others) We've enough food and water for three days
But how long is a day
Good question
(turning) Landon -- check your communications kit
39	  - He seems not to have heard
(sharply) Landon
Join the expedition
(rising) Sorry
(crossing to his kit) was thinking of Stewart
What d'you suppose happened
(flatly) Air leak
Died in her sleep
You don't seem very cut up about it
It's a little late for a wake
She's been dead nearly a year
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months
By our time
(smiling at Landon) You've turned gray
Landon involuntarily touches the gray hair of his temple as Taylor adds lightly: Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old
(casually) read the clocks
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis
We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade
(pause) Still can't accept it, huh
long pause) You know it
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust
Prove it
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory
It's a fact, Landon
Buy it
You'll sleep better
Dodge enters scene
handful of reddish sand dribbles through his fingers
Nothing will grow here
there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates
Any sign of dangerous ionization
No
(rising) Okay
If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it
That's when the groceries run out
He picks up one of the rucksacks and puts it on
The others follow suit
Which direction
(decisively, pointing west) That way
Any particular reason
None at all
He moves out
Dodge follows
with them
They have gone only a few paces when Taylor looks back over his shoulder and halts
40	  - Landon is squatting in the sand, sticking something into the soil
It is a small American flag, the size of a handkerchief
41	   - Mirth bubbles up in Taylor's throat
He explodes with wild laughter
He is still laughing as they move out
: 41-	  (	 #43) 42	 ' They descend from the plateau (Ochre Dunes) 43	  , Across the top of the hills there suddenly runs a line of fire (Black Dunes)
44 Jagged bolts of lightning flash across the sky, but bring, no rain, and thunder claps sound like heavy artillery
(Gray Area) 45- 58 : 59	     (  ) - - Several huge boulders are dislodged, and the three astronauts run
wildly to escape the falling rocks
When the avalanche ends, they sprawl on the lifeless sands, breathing heavily and drenched with sweat, surrounded by enormous boulders
Taylor looks about him
Everybody all right
Murmurs of assent from Dodge and Landon
Taylor rummages through a limp rucksack, comes up with some empty food cartons,rummages again, coming up with a cigar butt
Water check
Dodge takes a plastic canteen from another rucksack and inspects it
Eight ounces
Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky
It doesn't add up
There's a mantle of dust around this planet and yet it's as humid as a jungle
Thunder and lightning and yet no rain
Cloud cover every night and that strange luminosity, and yet no moon
Landon also looks up at the sky
If only we could get a fix
(needling him) What would you learn
've told you where you are and when you are
(gently) Taylor -- quit riding him
(harshly, to Landon) You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet
Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries
Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree
(wearily) All right -- There's only one reality left
We're here and it's now
You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead
(quietly) 'm prepared to die
Taylor turns to Dodge, throws up his hands
He's prepared to die
Doesn't that make you misty
Chalk up another victory for the human spirit
Dodge rises and moves off, o
s
, either embarrassed by this colloquy or unwilling to hear it again
Taylor, cigar clamped between his teeth, spins toward Landon
Straighten me out on something
Why did you come along at all
You volunteered
Why
(a beat; no answer) 'll tell you
They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down
Not without losing your All-American standing (hard) Climb off me, will you
And the glory, don't forget that
There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere
It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate
But never let it be said we forget our heroes
Taylor
'm telling you -- Oh, and one last item
Immortality
You wanted to go on forever
(pause) Well, you damn near made it
Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody
And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain
You got what you wanted, kid
How does it taste
Silence
Taylor lies down, spent of his venom, pillowing his head on a rucksack
(softly) Okay
You read me well enough
Why can't  read you
Don't bother (looking off) Dodge
he's not like me at all
But he makes sense
Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew
understand why  he's here
But you
You're no seeker
You're negative
But 'm not prepared to die
(heatedly) 'd like to know why not
You thought life on Earth was meaningless
You despised people
So what did you do
You ran away
Taylor's eyes are closed
He is silent for a moment
When he speaks, his tone is soft, reflective
No, not quite, Landon
'm a bit of a seeker myself
But my dreams are a lot emptier than yours
(pause) can't get rid of the idea that somewhere in the Universe there must be a creature superior to man
60	  - who has been wandering around, studying the boulders and the barren soil
Taylor and Landon can be seen in b
g
Dodge spots something and squats down to examine it
61	 -   : It is a tiny desert flower, no more than an inch high
62	 - His eyes light up as he calls: Taylor
Over here
63
- as Taylor and Landon hurry over and kneel down on either side of Dodge
The astronauts hover over the tiny flower like three magi perceiving the infant Deliverer
Life
He digs gently around the roots of the plant with a small instrument
Where there's one there's another
And another
And another
Let's find them all
63- 64 Absolute desolation (Ochre Area)
The astronauts start down the canyon
65 As they move across the terrain (top of Crazy Canyon)
65- As they jump across a gap
Thunder and lightning again (top of Crazy Canyon)
65- They march across Crazy Canyon overlook
65- 66- - (Wire Grass Canyon)
For a brief moment several "creatures" appear
We cannot identify the species
T0: 67
-    - Blooming tamarisks border a
dry stream bed
Taylor and Landon hover over Dodge, who is probing the soil with his drill
Their dungarees and faces are caked with dust
It's a stream bed
, no doubt about it -- but bone dry
Landon strightens up and looks off, startled by something he sees
Look
68	  - with the astronauts in f
g
In the distance, on the skyline, we can make out a long row of wooden crosses
Some animal or vegetable matter appears to be tied to the crosses
Scarecrows
Let's take a look
Taylor plunges into the thicket of tamarisks, followed by Dodge and Landon
Their view of the cliff is momentarily obscured on the distant crosses
For an instant only, three "creatures" again appear on the skyline near the crosses
Then they vanish
69	  - as they emerge from the tamarisk thicket-nearer to the base of the- cliff
They halt and look up at: 70	  -   -  '
We can now see the pelts of unrecognizable animals have been bound to the crosses and, thus mounted in a long row, seem to make a boundary or serve as a warning
The living bipeds are no longer visible
71 Dodge and Landon are still looking up at the strange crosses, but Taylor is scanning the terrain at the base of the cliff
The sound of rushing water can be heard
(half to himself) Never mind the scarecrows
He breaks into a run,   with him as he moves toward a declivity in the face of the cliff
72	  - Agonized with thirst, they follow Taylor
73	  - For an instant we see the bipeds again, moving in the same direction
74
- He scrambles up a rock-strewn gorge and looks off at the terrain beyond
75
-  '
The cascade is not spectacular, but the vegetation around it is startlingly lush
(This location is not at Lake Powell, but at the Ranch)
76	 - His parched lips break into a smile
: 77
-   - The cascade has formed a cool and inviting pool
Thick foliage grows to its very edge
Dodge is on his hands and knees, testing the liquid with his kit
The others wait expectantly
It's loaded with minerals, but safe
Without further ado Landon ducks his face into the pool
Dodge scoops up water in his hands and drinks
Taylor	follows suit
(coming up for air) Can we take a dip
(looks around) Okay
Landon and Dodge immediately remove their boots, strip down and plunge into the pool
But Taylor does not yet disrobe
Alert and curious, he strolls along the bank of the pool, looking around
78 79 as he briefly looks around, then starts taking off his shirt
80 as they arrive at opposite shore
81
- as Landon sees something on shore
82 as he swims across
' (o
s
) Hey, Taylor
Look at this -- Dodge and Taylor climb out of the pool and squat beside Landon
83	  -   : The print of a large five-toad foot is clearly visible in the wet sand
84	  - Taylor rises and walks slowly toward the underbrush, scanning the ground for other sports
: 85	      - Our view of the astronauts beyond the cascade in b
g
is partially obscured by broad-leafed foliage directly in front of , which away from the waterfall and  on the astronauts' clothing at the edge of the pool
Suddenly and inexplicably a pair of dungarees slithers away into the underbrush
few seconds pass
Now a pair of bronzed and brawny shoulders fill the , blocking our view
86	  - Or is it human
The hair is matted, the face bearded, the jaw prognathous, the orbital rim prominent
87	  - brown thick-fingered hand appears from behind heavy foliage and plucks at a boot
The boot vanishes
88	    - Dodge is standing near Taylor and looking back at the spot where they left their clothing
Suddenly he seizes Taylor's arm and points silently at the far bank of the pool
89	  : Another pair of dungarees slithers into the underbrush and disappears
90	  -    - Led by Taylor, they dive back into the pool and swim to the other bank
Emerging from the water, they look around in bewilderment
Taylor makes hand signals to indicate absolute silence and a reconnaissance
The three astronauts fan out and move cautiously into the jungle (or rain forest)
91- 93
-  (  ) -   - ' Little sunlight penetrates this dense vegetation
These  are with: 94	   : fleeting forms as yet unidentified; trembling foliage; brown shadows against a green backdrop
95
- who stop at the edge of the clearing, startled by 96	  : a number of primitive bipeds, male and female, scarcely visible behind trees and bushes on the other side of the clearing -- here a face, there a portion of a head and torso
Throughout this sequence, the primitives are never seen clearly or at close range
97	   AST40IONAUTS reacting
They speak in whispers
My God
they look almost human
They -- there's a herd of them
Show them we're friendly
as Taylor advances a few steps into the clearing, extending his empty hands and beaming like a politician
(warmly) Greetings
98	 -    -  '
There are perhaps a dozen of them
They shrink back as Taylor advances -- hostile, frightened or both
We now see that some of them are clutching articles of the astronauts' clothing and equipment
Taylor stops, stares at them glumly
No cigar
Try telling them our names
Taylor grimaces at Landon
Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker
(turning to the creatures) Listen, folks
More shrinking back by the frightened primitives
(softly) 'm afraid they aren't having any
99- 102 103-	     -   (  ): 105 pistol goes off with a deafening crash, and the primitive creatures scatter in panicky flight
After a while, quiet returns to the jungle
106
- They examine the remnants of their clothing and equipment and start to don whatever is able to be worn
Taylor puts on what remains of a ripped pair of trousers; Dodge starts to improvise from the remnants of the kit (it is a torn shelter half)
Landon, like Taylor, has the remains of his pants
They didn't leave much did they
Shall we follow them
Haven't much choice
As they walk off down the jungle path
: 107
-   - This need not be a cultivated grove
few trees (peach or apricot or avocado, it matters not) grow wild in a pleasant glade
Nor is the grove extensive
The three astronauts sit under a tree in f
g
; the primitives sit under a clump, of trees some fifty yards away
Each camp is feeding and warily watching the other
In the distance beyond the fruit trees is an open grassy plain or cultivated field
108	  -  '
They too are sitting under trees, munching fruit
There are no more than a dozen altogether
109	   - Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us
Blessed are the vegetarians
110	   - Squatting on her haunches, eating fruit, gazing back at Taylor
Her hair is long and black, her skin nut brown, her face hauntingly lovely and hauntingly stupid
This is
111 Landon looks o
s
at the primitives
We got off at the wrong stop
You're our optimist Look at the bright side
If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet
(suddenly) Look
112	  -
They appear to be agitated although neither we nor the astronauts have yet heard or seen any cause for alarm
The primitives get to their feet, sniffing, listening 113	   - Puzzled and alarmed by the primitives' behavior, they too get to their feet
Think they'll attack us
Taylor turns, looks back at: 114	   ( ) From which they recently emerged
There is no sign of life
115	   - They suddenly run laterally across the grove, heading  back toward their jungle
rumble becomes audible	it is the  of
116	   -   ( ) Twelve "horsemen" suddenly emerge from the trees, riding abreast at a canter, like a squadron of cavalry about to charge
The horses look huge
So do the riders, but at this distance we cannot identify them
117	   - Cut off from their natural habitat, they reverse direction and flee toward the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field)
118	  - With an exultant battle cry they break into a gallop
The hunt is on
119	   - Stupefied, frozen in place
120 	  - Coming closer
We  a rifle shot, then a flurry of shots
121
bullet spanks into the fruit trees above their heads
They run, with them as they race toward the tall grass in deep b

122-	     - 124 As the "horsemen" close in on the creatures fleeing on foot
125
- He reins in, raises his rifle and fires
For the first time, we se that he is a
He wears a simple quasi-military uniform -- tunic, trousers and boots
126	  - Running through the high grass
He is shot in the back and falls
127	  - He drops at the side of his fallen comrade
128	   - As Taylor rolls him over
Dodge is dead
129	   -   - The beaters are all
They carry long sticks and nets, and their task is to flush out the terrified primitives cowering in the tall grass
130-	    -     : 135 (a)	Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by another
He stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him
(b)	 third mounted gorilla flings a net over a running female
She is hopelessly entangled
This is Nova
(c)	Landon lies unconscious on the grassy plain, an ugly gash on his forehead
(d)	Taylor crawls through the tall grass on his hands and knees
rider crosses his path without seeing him
(e)	The beaters close in on Taylor, blocking his escape route
(f)	Taylor changes direction and decides to run for it
136	,  - Bent low, he flees through the tall grass
rings out
Taylor falls
137 Lying on his back
His fingers go to his throat
Blood appears between his fingers
He opens his mouth in pain, but no sound comes forth, as Taylor sinks into unconsciousness
: 138
-   -   - The hunting party has reassembled here beneath the fruit trees
Some of the gorillas have dismounted; others are still on horseback
In the middle distance is a crude horse-drawn wagon
The sides and top of the wagon form a wire cage
Three captive males and one female are visible within the cage
Dodge and Landon are nowhere to be seen
Two gorilla porters enter scene, dragging a male human corpse by the ankles, as two other bearers enter scene with a living burden on a long carrying pole
Taylor dangles from the pole, held aloft by the bonds around his wrists and ankles
with the two gorillas as they dump Taylor into the wagon and close the tail gate
139- 140 141	   - His throat is smeared with blood
His eyelids flutter as he regains consciousness
142	  -   : Three primitive males bound hand and foot
They seem docile in captivity
The female, Nova, clasps bound wrists around her bound ankles and gazes blankly at Taylor
There is a  of  as the wagon gets underway 143 With a great effort he raises himself on one elbow and looks out from the cage
144	    -   : gorilla hunter stands over a dead man, one foot planted he chest of his kill and his rifle butt resting on the on   abdomen
Facing him is another gorilla with an old-fashioned camera on a tripod
Smile
The hunter bares his teeth
145 He faints
146
- The surgery is dimly-lit
(If possible we should be unaware of the source of illumination
) Taylor lies strapped to the nearer table
He appears to be unconscious
The young female captive, Nova, is strapped to the table beside him
She is conscious
Taylor is receiving a direct blood transfusion from her
Hovering over Taylor are a  and a surgeon named
Both are chimpanzees
Galen wears a bloody surgical apron, the nurse a white smock
Galen is removing a filthy bandage from Taylor's neck
door behind them opens and
, an animal psychologist,	enters
She, too, is a chimpanzee and wears a smock like the nurse's
Which one was wearing the strange clothes
Him
Zira looks down at Taylor
Will he live
(irritably) don't know
This beast lost a lot of blood
Galen paws through a tray of surgical instruments
The equipment is obsolescent and the room untidy -- like that of a callous small-town veterinarian
(to Nurse ) There's no probe here
Find one
Yes, sir
She exits
Zira runs a forefinger across a dusty table
Her voice is soft and well-modulated
This place is dirty, doctor
(defensively) These animals are dirty, doctor
They stink, and they carry communicable diseases
Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here
147	   - His eyes come open
Over this we hear: ' (o
s
) You don't sound happy in your work
' (o
s
) 'm nothing more than a vet in this laboratory
Taylor feebly turns his head and looks at Nova
She returns his gaze with an unchanged empty stare
We sense that Taylor realizes her blood is flowing into his veins
Over this we hear: ' (o
s
) You promised to speak to Dr
Zaius about me
' (o
s
) did
But you know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees
Taylor rolls his eyes toward the apes
Weak as he is,we see his astonishment at hearing them talk
148 as the Nurse reenters with a probe and hands it to Dr
Galen, who protests to Zira: But the quota system's been abolished
You made it
Why can't
What do you mean, made it
'm an animal psychologist, that's all
We don't have any authority
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment
That's because Dr
Zaius realizes our work has value
Hmph
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals
They're still dirty
And their bite is septic
Look at that
He shows Zira infected teeth marks on the back of his left hand
(to Nurse) Hold his head
The Nurse complies, gripping Taylor's skull with both hands
Galen leans down and begins to probe the throat wound
Taylor passes out
: 149
-   - The cages are no larger than small jail cells
There are four of them
Bars, not walls, divide the cages, so that all four are visible
Each of the first three cages is occupied by a primitive male
At the moment the first two are quiet -- dozing or scratching apathetically
The third occupant is stolidly regarding a half-dozen brightly colored hollow wooden boxes, or blocks, Of varying sizes and proportions on the floor of his cage
He is trying to stack the boxes in such a way as to reach a banana dangling from a cord twelve feet overhead
He has correctly selected the first two large, sturdy blocks for his tower under the banana -- but the tall third block is too unstable on its small base to support the broad-based fourth block
149-	 - Taylor, Looking much stronger, sits on a pile of dirty straw in the fourth cage
There is a clean bandage around his throat
He watches the block-building primitive with contemptous amusement
Both the third and fourth blocks tumble to the floor when the primitive tries to mount his tower
He stands there, staring dully at the scattered blocks, then up at the unattainable banana
149-
- door at the end of the aisle opens and a gorilla named  enters, dressed in a keeper's uniform
He quickly closes the door, snatches up a broom, starts sweeping
Julius is obviously late for work
Taylor struggles to his feet, moves to the bars of the cage, tries to call out
(soundlessly) Hey
Hey
The three other primitives move toward the bars of their cages
Julius barks at them
Simmer down
(points at Taylor) You especially
The third primitive goes back to stacking his blocks
Julius comes up to Taylor's cage, indicates a like set of blocks strewn across its floor, extends his broom handle to whack the banana overhead
Better give it a try, stupid
Unless you like going hungry
He returns to his sweeping
Taylor glowers at him
moment later, the door at the end of the aisle opens and Dr
Zira enters
Good morning, Dr
Zira
Good morning, Julius
How's our patient today
No change
The minute you open the door, he goes into his act
She starts down the aisle toward Taylor's cage
He grasps the bars, awaiting her anxiously
As she passes the second cage, the primitive in it shakes the bars, jumps up and down
His tongue is hanging out
Zira smiles, stops, digs into the pocket of her smock
(playfully) Well, what do we want this morning
Do we want something
Speak
Come on, speak
The primitive continues to jump up and down energetically
Zira takes a cube of sugar from her pocket, holds it up for his inspection
Do we want some sugar, old-timer
The man eagerly sticks his hand through the bars
She drops the cube in his hands
He jams it into his mouth
(concerned) You could get hurt doing that, Doctor
Don't be silly
He's perfectly tame
She moves toward Taylor's cage, Julius behind her
They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you
150	  -   - Taylor starts to open his mouth as Zira comes up to the bars
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better
(frantic mouthing) Listen, listen --  can speak -- He winces, puts his hand to the bandage
(sympathetically) Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it
See
He keeps pretending he can talk
Taylor glares at Julius, slams the bars
(mouthing) 'm not pretending
can talk
Zira hurriedly takes a pen and notebook from the breast Docket of her smock, starts to scribble
(excitedly) Did you see that
It's remarkable
Huh
He's trying to form words
Well, you know what they say
Human see, human do
Taylor is staring in silent fascination at the open and notebook
He stops mouthing, points at them
Now what
Taylor gestures for Zira to come closer to the bars
He seems to want something
She advances tentatively toward the cage
'd be careful, doctor
Taylor suddenly reaches through the bars, tries to snatch the pen and notebook from Zira
Julius instantly jabs his broom handle through the bars, hitting Taylor in the ribs
What did  tell you
(to Taylor) Try that again, 'll break your arm
Zira draws back, looking at Taylor in surprise
151	 - His face is twisted in frustration
(mouthing) What's the matter with you
can talk
Can't you see that
Over this a door is heard opening o
s
, and Julius' voice, nervous, deferential: ' (o
s
) Good morning, Your Excellency
Taylor looks o
s
152- 160 161	  -    -  '
Julius and Zira cross to a stout, imposing orangutan who has just entered the laboratory
Julius bows to him
This is
Like the other apes, he wears a simple tunic and trousers, but his garments are of a Costlier material, and several decorations are woven into the sash of his tunic
(bubbling) Dr
Zaius, 'm so glad you could come
He's over here
Zaius crosses with them to Taylor's cage
Beneath his austere manner, we sense tension, worry
Zira looks up at Taylor, her tone an appeal
Bright Eyes, show him
Go ahead
Do your trick
Taylor just glares at her
Speak
Go on
Speak again
(silent mouthing) My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor
There
Can you believe it
looks like he's talking
(evenly) Yes, amusing
man who acts like an ape
Taylor turns to Zaius
(silent mouthing) 'm not acting
can talk
How much proof do you want
(thunderstruck) Dr
Zaius,  could have sworn he was answering you
(nodding, but unmoved) He shows a definite gift for mimicry
Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly
wonder how held score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test
Zaius' voice is quiet, but there is steel in it
An animal
Look
Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers
He's moving his fingers
Of course
He saw you moving yours
But perhaps he understood -- 161-	 - He is pleading silently as Zaius' voice is heard over the
' (o
s
, hard) Man has no understanding, Dr
Zira
He can be taught a few simple tricks
Nothing more
' (o
s
) beg to disagree
According to my exper- iments -- 161-	 - warning burns out of his eyes as he stares at Taylor
word to the wise, Dr
Zira
Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing
'm all for it
161-	 - Fear clouds his eyes
Abruptly, he stops moving his lips
161- Zaius sees the effect his words have had on Taylor
He turns to Zira, goes on in a more detached tone
But your behavioral studies are another matter entirely
To suggest that we can learn something about simian nature from a study of man is nonsense
Besides, men are a nuisance
They outgrow their own food supply in the forest and migrate to our green belts and ravage our crops
(looking casually at Taylor) The sooner they're exterminated, the better
He turns toward the door
disappointed Zira follows him
Zaius looks back at Taylor just before going out
It's a question of simian survival
161-	 - He stares after Zaius, than looks away, slumps to the floor
pause, then a  is heard
Is this the one you wanted, Doctor
' (o
s
) Yes, thank you
(pause, her voice much closer) Bright Eyes
Taylor looks up
' (o
s
) 've got a present for you
161-	  - Standing outside the cage, held on a leash by an    is Nova
She looks at Taylor without expression
Zira gestures at
Put her in with him
Julius unlocks the cage door-, leads Nova inside, removes her leash and collar
Taylor has gotten to his feet
Julius goes out, locking the door behind him
Nova hesitates, then slowly reaches out, takes Taylor's hand
Zira beams at them
162- 169 : 170
-    -   - It is nothing elaborate,  wire fence encloses a dirt yard
This compound is situated on the outskirts of Apetown and the town is visible in the distance
There are about a dozen adult human captives within the enclosure, no more than a third of them females
Some of them trudge around the dusty yard like convicts in a penitentiary
Others squat against the sun- drenched wall
big male suddenly runs to the fence and tries to climb it
Several guides, armed with whips and torches, immediately close in on him
The primitive recoils in fear from a fiery torch and rejoins the captives' circle
171	  -   - He plods sullenly back and forth across the rear of the yard, occasionally glancing off toward the approaches to the compound
Nova is at his heels
He ignores her
Once again he looks off, stops suddenly
Nova bumps into him
He turns, impatiently shoos her away, then looks o
s
, again
172	   - '
Zira can be seen approaching with a young chimpanzee,
He wears a simple smock over his tunic and trousers
Cornelius glances surreptitiously around, covertly takes Zira's hand
Do you have to work tonight
No
Neither do
He gives her a quick peck on the cheek
173	 - He drifts toward the fence, Nova behind him
174
- They come up to the fence
Zira nods toward Taylor
That's Bright Eyes
The one  was telling you about
What's so special about him
Watch
(to Taylor) Hello, Bright Eyes
How's our throat today
Taylor stares at her impassively, then looks around to a that no guards are watching, hunkers down, begins to scratch in the dust
Nova extends unclean fingers to touch the bandage on his throat
Taylor flinches, pushes her hand away
Nova touches a bluish bruise on the inside of her own forearm, then searches for a similar bruise on Taylor's forearm
(excited) Look -- she remembers
Remembers what
The blood transfusion
(peeved) Zira, come on
You know they can't -- (he stops, looking off) Oh oh
Here comes Number One
Taylor looks up and o
s
, quickly rises
175	  -   - Who is approaching the two scientists from deep b
g
Zaius is followed by a huge and much decorated gorilla Whom we recognize as the Leader of the Hunt Club
(in a whisper, to Cornelius) Something's bothering him
He's been prying around the lab for the last two days
(as Zaius comes nearer) Good morning, Dr
Zaius
You know Dr
Cornelius, my fiance
Cornelius bows respectfully
Zaius is patronizingly polite
Oh, yes -- the young ape with a shovel
hear you're planning another archeological expedition
-175
- He has stepped back from the marks he made in the-dust, is watching Zaius with concern
' (o
s
) Yes, sir
If the academy agrees
' (o
s
) The project will require my support, of course
176
- primitive male squats down to see what Taylor has marked on the ground
In letters a foot high he has written: Nova, at once petulant and playful, erases the  with a bare foot
Taylor angrily flings her aside
This violence provokes the primitive male, who snarls at Taylor and cuffs him
Over this we  from a distance: ' (o
s
) hope  can count on it, sir
' (o
s) friendly warning, Cornelius -- when you're digging for artifacts, don't bury your reputation
Taylor slugs the snarling male, who wades in, trying to bite him
(o
s
) Guards
177	  - Two gorilla guards rush in to break up the fight
One of them lashes out with his whip
The other pokes his torch at Taylor
Its flame brushes his arm
Taylor opens his mouth, gives a silent yell of pain, shrinks back
Zira runs to the fence
(to guards) Stop
You've hurt him
Take them inside
Prodding the malcreants with their torches, the two guards herd them toward a doorway in the wall
Zira hurries around the side of the fence and o
s
178
- , , Cornelius, if you have a moment today, 'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail
(eagerly) Certainly, sir
'll get my notes and come right over
He exits hurriedly
The Hunt Club Leader turns to Zaius
don't understand these animal psychologists
What's Dr
Zira trying to prove
That man can be domesticated
The hunter guffaws
Zaius turns away and looks down at: 179 Just beyond the fence we can make out the letters: Zaius' extended foot appears beneath the bottom wire of the fence
The foot wipes out the letters
180	 - His face is a mask
181
'  -
- He is slumped against the bars of the cell, gingerly touching a large, reddening blotch on his arm
Julius watches him uncertainly from a few yards away
In the b
g
, the outside door opens and Zira rushes in, hurries down the aisle
What happened
Those fools and their torches
Do you have any ointment
'll see
He moves to a cabinet at the other end of the laboratory, rummages through some drawers
182
-  -  '
Zira comes up to Taylor's cage, studies him solicitously
'm sorry, Bright Eyes
183	  - He looks steadily at Zira, who is only an arm's length away on them
Suddenly Taylor reaches out, snatching the pen and notebook from the pocket of her smock
Zira leaps back with a cry
Julius grabs a club, races up to the cage, unlocks the door
told you what you'd get
184	  - Taylor is scribbling furiously on a sheet of note paper
The guard moves in, his club upraised
(pleading) Julius, don't
It doesn't matter
Julius swings his-club at Taylor's head
Taylor lifts his right arm to ward off the blow, and the stick strikes him sharply on the hand
He drops the pen and notebook
The guard swings again, driving Taylor to the wall
Then Julius retrieves the stolen articles
185	  - The guard returns her pen and notebook with the comment: Natural born thieves, aren't they
Zira glances at the notebook
Her face clouds
186	 -   : hasty, almost illegible scrawl: 187	 - Her eyes afire with a wild surmise
188	  - Her eyes never leave Taylor as she tells the guard: Get me a collar and leash
'm taking him to the infirmary
He's vicious, Doctor
Besides, it's against the rules
Do as  say
The guard shrugs and moves Off 0

Zira beckons to Taylor
He comes forward to the bars of the cage
(sotto voce) You wouldn't hurt me, would you
Taylor
189
'  -   - The office is simple, almost Spartan
There are books but no bric-a- brac; several painted portraits of Great Apes but no tape recorder or other modern office equipment
Taylor sits at a desk, scribbling furiously on a sheet of paper
His leash has been removed, but not his collar
Zira stands at his elbow
Cornelius paces nervously up and down, reading a sheaf of notes Taylor has already written
(stubbornly) It's a stunt
Humans don't write
Dear, you're a scientist
Don't you believe your own eyes
(to Taylor) Where did you learn to do this
190	  - Taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, hands it to Cornelius
Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne, Indiana
He looks at Taylor narrowly
Taylor nods
(sardonically) Back on that planet you say you came from
(Taylor nods again) Um-hm
(to Zira) He may be intelligent, but he's also mad
Taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to Zira, points at Cornelius
(reads aloud) 'And you're a fool'
She smiles
Cornelius bristles
Now, just a minute -- Oh, Cornelius, be quiet
Taylor has resumed writing
He hands the sheet to Zira, who reads aloud
'Dodge was killed in the hunt
What happened to Landon
' (looking at Taylor) don't know
(scornfully) And they fell out of the sky with you
Taylor writes quickly, hands the note to Zira
(reading) 'Not fell -- flew
' Taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper
Flight is a scientific impossibility
And even if it weren't, why fly
Where would it get you
Taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "Here
" He flings the paper plane he has just fashioned into the air
It describes a graceful arc around the room and lands at the feet of Cornelius, who slowly picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with Zira
(softly) Well, now
Taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to Zira
(reading) 'Do you have maps
' Cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map designed like a window shade
He pulls it down Taylor and Zira join him at the map
191 It's not a map of the whole planet, of course, but only of that portion known to the apes
Therefore it has the antique and fragmentary aspect of a map drawn by some Babylonian cartographer
swatch of blue at the right margin indicates a sea
In the southwest quadrant are the "greenbelts" of the ape civilization, looking on the map like jade stones strung on crescent-shaped necklace
Rubyidots in the lade indicate ape communities
The northwest quadrant, colored brown, is apparently uninhabited
East of the green belts is a patch of green savanna, and next to it the darker green of a jungle
The eastern quadrants are rendered in yellow, and except for a blue lake, appear to be lifeless desert and barren mountain
This area is marked Using a pointer, Cornelius orients Taylor, indicating a red dot in the middle of the green belt
We are here
(moving pointer) You were captured about here
Taylor studies the map, then pointing at the lake in the eastern desert, he goes into a brief charade, dramatizing the astronauts' landing and trek
(interpreting his movements) You fell in the water here
you came ashore
you marched across the desert
the mountains
many days and nights
and reached the jungle
Taylor nods, smiles gratefully
(flatly) Out - of - the - question
Taylor slams his fist against the wall in frustration
(annoyed) Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him
(tapping map) No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone
've been there
've seen it
192	  - Taylor strides to the desk, writes something, hands it to Zira
(reading) 'Then how do you account for me
, don't
And 'm not going to try
But what about your theory
The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it
(shushing her) Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off
Don't be foolish
If it's true, they'll have to accept it
No, they won't - Taylor touches Zira on the arm, makes a gesture of inquiry
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis - (quickly) It's probably wrong -- -- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man
In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time - The evidence was very meager -- You didn't think so then
That was before Dr
Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy
How can scientific truth be heresy
What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed
mutation
missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape - Taylor bangs his fist on the desk, mouths the word "No
" scribbles something on a piece of paper
He's touchy, isn't he
Taylor thrusts the sheet at Zira, who reads it aloud
' am not a missing link
' Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment
Well, maybe they're not
No, thank you'
won't get into that battle
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength
Zira, listen to me
We've got a fine future ahead of us
Marriage
Stimulating careers
'm up for a raise -- At that moment 	there is a
loud  at the door o
s
All turn
193	  - Dr
Zaius enters with another portly figure,
Like Zaius
, Maximus is an orangutan
(flustered) Dr
Zaius -- (not unkindly) Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius
Oh
, no
, sir
was just assembling my notes
You know Dr
Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs
Certainly, sir
It's a pleasure to see you again
He hurries to his desk, starts gathering papers
Maximus notes Taylor with distaste
What is that
man, Dr
Maximus
know it's a man
And you know the rules
No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash
194	  -   - During the ensuing exchange, Zaius wanders idly through the office
He glances at the scattered handwritten notes, but does not read them
Meanwhile a rattled Zira replies to Maximus
Yes, Sir
But this -- creature is a special case
Why special
We're -- conducting a new experiment
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office
Yes, Sir
(calling) Guards
The gorilla  enter from outside
Return this beast to the compound
195	  - He regards the apes with hostility as they cross to him
One picks up his leash
Over   we hear: ' (o
s
) What's this
196	  - Zira stiffens, looking at Zaius
He is holding the paper plane fashioned by Taylor
toy
It floats on the air
(faint defiance) Try it
(a warning) Zira
Zaius looks down at the paper plane in his hand, then back to Zira
He smiles tolerantly
Nonsense
He crumples the paper plane into a b all
, drops it on the desk
The ape hooks the leash to Taylor's collar, starts leading him out
Zira follows them
: 197
-   -   - The caged primitives are asleep
Julius, the keeper, dozes in a chair outside Taylor's cage
Taylor, who is lying on his side, also asleep
Nova is curled up behind him
At the sound of a door opening, she comes instantly awake, sitting up and clutching Taylor's arm
He comes groggily awake, raising his head in time to hear: ' (o
s
) What's up, Lieutenant
198	  -   : have just entered the compound
They wear side arms
Julius has just risen from his  chair
We're taking Number Four over to surgery in five minutes
Have him ready
How come
The beast's throat is nearly healed
(snickering) It's not his throat this time
The vet's going to geld him
199	 - He stiffens but does not move
The apes, of course, speak freely in front of him, believing the animal cannot understand
' (o
s
) Dr
Zira won't like it
She wants this pair to mate
200	    -  '
As the Lieutenant replies: These orders came from Dr
Zaius himself
There's nothing she can do about it
The two gorillas exit
The guard crosses to a wall peg for a collar and 'Leash
201	   - Pushing Nova aside, Taylor rises
202
- As Julius unlocks the door and cautiously approaches Taylor, carrying the collar and leash
(murmuring) If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what they're going to do
(raising collar) Stand still now
don't give me any trouble
The heel of Taylor's right palm crashes into the keeper's, chin, nearly snapping his neck
Julius falls unconscious
Taylor leans over him, taking his night stick and a set of keys on his belt
203	  - The male has awakened
He stares stupidly at Taylor
Nova is whimpering, little strange cries of fear
Taylor moves o
s
204	  - He leaves the cage, moves swiftly to the nearby door and exits
205
-   - Barefoot, Taylor silently pads down the corridor to a locked door
206 Which is visible because of a beam of sunlight from the half-open door of a guard room
We  a murmur of ape voices and
Taylor fumbles with the keys, finds one that fits the lock and opens the door
207
-
-  - He emerges, quietly locking the door behind him
Two tethered horses can be seen in deep b
g
, and another gust of  can be heard from the nearby guard room
Taylor looks off
208	  -   : As already established, the animal compound is situated on the outskirts of the apes' community
The strange skyline of the town can be seen in the distance
209 He starts to cross an open field outside the compound
At that moment we  a shrill police  from the guard room
Taylor breaks into a run
210	  - As the two gorilla officers emerge from the building and run toward their horses
211
-   - He runs down the road, starts across the long causeway that bisects a small lake, looking over his shoulder
: 212
-    - The community we sue at the end of the causeway is small and arcane
There are no power lines, no street lamps -- indeed, no streets as such, but only a small cluster of buildings around a pleasant mall
The architecture of the buildings is faintly derivative of the simpler and less rococo work of Antonio Gaudi -- columns and pillars of brick or exterior masonry look like the trunks and branches of great trees and suggest an arboreal past
small number of apes are visible on the mall: Taylor darts behind the buttress of a building, casing the situation
He looks back at: 213
-   - The two mounted gorilla-police can be seen on the causeway, galloping straight toward
It is evident they will soon spot Taylor
214	   - He retreats from the buttress to a dark archway and vanishes inside the building
215
- The vestibule is nothing, no set required, a dark space through which Taylor moves toward a shaft of light
We  faintly the discordant chords of an organ
Or is it an organ
At any rate,a strange and melancholy tune
Taylor arrives at a font
216
- He appears out of darkness into half-light
The rear of the temple is obscure
Taylor darts behind a screen
Crouching there, he observes: 217	      - The temple itself is small and austere
There is no altar, but against a plain backdrop we see a statue of the Lawgiver, a Great Ape holding a book
Below the Lawgiver is an   clothed in black robes
He stands in front of a closed coffin
dozen mourners, seated on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi-circle around the coffin
The ape ladies wear cowls
Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow
He lives again
Yes, he has found peace in Heaven
218	 - Crouching, listening, wide-eyed
' (o
s
) He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember; hunter, warrior, defender of the Faith
219	    -  '
As the minister continues his eulogy, a small ape boy detaches himself (as children will) from the group of mourners and comes marching up the aisle toward the rear of the temple
Cherished husband, beloved father, generous master -- yes, he was a font of simian kindness
220 	  - Who is still crouching behind the screen in deep b
g
The small fry is coming closer
Over this we hear: ' (o
s
) The dear departed once said to me: ' never met an ape  didn't like'
The small fry spots Taylor
(shrill soprano) Look
It's a man
The mourners' heads turn
Taylor slinks toward the vestibule
221	  - He is aghast
In Heaven's name
(aside to ushers) Get rid of that creature
Two ushers rise, moving past  and o
s
222
- Staying close on the temple wall, Taylor moves stealthily away from the vestibule door
The two ape ushers appear
(pointing) There he is: They move toward Taylor
223	  - He runs out onto the mall
224	  - Taylor belatedly sees that he is running straight toward his two mounted pursuers
Darting off in another direction, he races past startled pedestrians
225	  - They do a slow take
You see what  saw
Must've escaped from the zoo
226
- He has spotted Taylor
Drawing a folded net from his saddlebag, he swings it overhead (like a cowboy with a lariat) and gallops off in pursuit of the man
227-	  - 231 Taylor runs frantically from building to building, rounding corners, vanishing momentarily and reappearing on another part of the mall
At one point the mountie nearly overtakes him and flings his net, which falls short
Taylor runs on
232
-    (  ) It is an open-air structure, like a Greek theater, located near the central mail
Steeply tiered, it seats no more than fifty apes
The dais in the pit is some fifteen feet above ground level
Taylor enters scene, running toward the amphitheater
Changing direction, he darts into what appears to be an access tunnel
moment later the pursuing cop rides into' scene, dismounts and walks toward the amphitheater, looking around for Taylor
233
-    (  ) Taylor suddenly emerges from the access tunnel and runs up a ramp encircling the amphitheater
( retaining wall shields him from the view of the apes
) Pausing for breath at the top of the ramp, Taylor crouches behind the uppermost tier of seats and peers down: -  '
The cop looks around, spots Taylor at the top tier, and starts up after him
235- 237 238
- He starts to run back down the ramp, but is suddenly confronted by his original pursuer (the dismounted cop coming up the ramp
Reversing direction, Taylor runs around the rim of the amphitheater and vanishes into an exit tunnel
The cop blows his whistle, summoning another cop, who joins him in the chase
239-	     - 244 In which we see the fugitive, his pursuers and the reactions of ape shoppers and workers
245-
-  - 248 market has been set up on one side of the mall, where street vendors behind carts or tables hawk their wares: fruits, vegetables, wearing apparel, etc
As Taylor runs frantically through the market place, several apes join the chase
In the ensuing pandemonium, like the proverbial Chinese fire drill, several tables are overturned
249
- Taylor runs into scene, pauses, panting, and looks back at his pursuers
Then he darts through the archway into the building
250
-    - For the moment he is the sole visitor in this wing
His pace slows to a walk as he and we observe fleetingly the specimens in what is a simian museum: Possibly several stuffed and unfamiliar animals; primitive artifacts and fossils; possibly the skeleton of a dog, a cat, etc
Over this we hear a shrill police
251	  - He runs again
252
- Looking at the stuffed animals as Taylor races past
The mother gives a startled
253	  - He starts after the fugitive
254	     - He runs past displays of other stuffed animals toward  and halts abruptly in close f
g
, shocked by: 255	  : stuffed and mounted, Dodge bares his teeth at the world
256	 - Reacting in horror
He hears another police  and the echoing of approaching guards, which mufffle his strangled gasp: Dodge
Taylor vanishes in a  of movement
: 257
-  -      - Order has been restored in the open-air market
Taylor bursts suddenly into view from a building on the far side of the mall, running in panic from ape guards in close pursuit
mounted policeman spots him and heads him off
Changing direction, Taylor is intercepted by another mounted Gorilla
And then a third
,   on the center of the mall
We are witnessing a hideous game: "baiting the man
"  The mounted police do not shoot or club Taylor, for he cannot escape -- but they circle him, their long whips  over his head
258	  -     - who unfolds his net, swings it overhead and flings it at Taylor
This time he bags his quarry
Taylor gives up
Spent, docile, entangled in the net, he stands stock-still in the center of the mall
Guards and civillians on foot join the circle around the man at bay
They regard him warily
259	  - She pushes through the simian crowd around Taylor and hurries to his side
260	   - She paws at the net, crying impulsively: Taylor, why'd you run away
Zira removes the net from his face
Panting with exhaustion, Taylor flicks a wild glance at her
He looks demented
261	  - who approach Taylor and Zira
(They are the same gorillas introduced in Scene 198
) One of them carries a collar and leash
The other presents an
card to Zira
Security police
(promptly) 'm in charge of this man
No longer, madame
He is now in the custody of the Ministry of Science
His colleague moves toward Taylor with a muzzle
262	  - He speaks at last, his voice hoarse but audible
Get away from me, you dirty ape
263	  - The arresting officer steps back involuntarily
All the apes freeze, staring at the speaking animal with mute astonishment as we: 264
-   -    - The compound is dimly lit
Taylor, the bandage now gone from his throat, is back in his old cage
The other cages, however, are empty -- their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo
He is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, Nova's head cradled on his lap
Idly he strokes her coarse hair
There is a dull glow of madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like a man talking to a dog
and that's when  decided to take up astronautical engineering
, you see was halfway through college and
(he breaks off) It's an old trick
The silent treatment
Four weeks and three days, and not a word from anyone
Not Zira
,or Cornelius
or that damn Julius
No one'll listen
only you
You
Nova
-
His manner is now more direct, and educative
, but she stares in blank comprehension
She brushes his moving lips with her fingers
He shrugs wryly
Yeah
me Tarzan, you Jane
That's all right
had a puppy once that never barked
He just licked my hand
(pause) He's dead now
They're all dead
Everything
think maybe they'll kill me, too
Are they afraid of me
can't hurt them
but threaten them somehow
Threaten their faith in simian superiority
Yeah
you're right
They'll have to kill me
Faint footsteps are heard o
s
Taylor and Nova look in the direction of the sound
sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes Taylor in the chest
265	  -   : An ape  has a high pressure hose trained on Taylor
It forces him back toward the rear of the cage
Julius, whip in hand, unlocks the cage, steps inside
He unlimbers the whip
, cracks it-'in Nova's direction
She recoils
The jet of water hold Taylor at bay
Julius grabs Nova, begins to pull her toward the door of the cage
Taylor tries to fight his way through the water toward Julius
Let her alone
Julius swings the whip
It cracks against Taylor's legs, biting into the skin
Taylor stumbles, falls to one knee Where are you taking her
What are you going to do
Julius drags and pushes the girl through the door, slamming and locking it behind him
Taylor, fights through the stream of water, flings himself against the bars
(raging) Take your hands off her, you black monster
You filth
Julius shoves Nova across the aisle to a cage opposite Taylor's, locks her inside
Why are you doing this
Say something, you hairy scum
Julius gestures toward the ape guard Turn it off
The ape guard shuts off the hose
Answer me
Julius strides over to Taylor's cage
(fiercely) Shut up
The reason no one'll talk to you is because you're a freak
Where's Dr
Zira
Why--
said shut up
He slashes viciously with his whip handle against Taylor's fingers
Taylor yells in pain
Julius and the ape guard start out of the compound
(wildly) Ape
Apes wearing clothes
It's a madhouse
madhouse
He sinks to the floor as the apes go out
266 267	  - Taylor looks desolately through the bars across to Nova's cage
She eyes him sadly
(gently) Now  don't even have you
(pause) Imagine me -- needing someone
Back on Earth there was nobody
Women, yes
Lots of them
Love making  ithout love
That's the kind of world it was turning into, with the help of cynics like myself
So  left it -- because there was no one dear enough to keep me there
(pause) Did  tell you about Stewart
(Looking away) There was a lovely girl
The most precious cargo we brought along
If human life could survive here, she was to be the new Eve
(morosely) It's probably just as well she didn't live to see this
He looks at Nova
She stretches her hands through the bars toward him
wonder if it's Love between us
(looks around, smiles ironically) What a place to find it
-267	  - Two gorilla officers enter, carrying torches
(These are the same apes introduced in Scene 198
) One carries a double set of manacles
Julius comes to meet them
The Lieutenant takes the two sets of manacles from the other officer, hands them to Julius, whispers something
Julius comes over and unlocks the door of Taylor's cage
He advances to Taylor, who does not move, bends down and clamps the manacles around each of his ankles
Then he straightens, lifts Taylor's arms, pulls his wrists together, snaps on the cuffs
-267	  - Taylor looks across at Nova, blows her a kiss
Julius leads him out of the cage, takes his leash from a snaps it onto Taylor's collar, hands the other end to the Lieutenant
Nova and Julius watch in silence as Taylor is led down the aisle and out the door
268- 272 : 273
-   - Taylor, wearing his manacles, is seated at a table in the otherwise deserted chamber
There is an empty chair on either side of him
Across the room stands a dais with three rude, high-backed chairs
There is a small table directly below the dais
third table stands at right angles to the dais
Taylor looks around the empty room
door is opened by a gorilla , and Zira and Cornelius come into the room, sit down on each side of Taylor
moment later,
, the Prosecutor and a  enter, take their seats at the third table
(softly) Where have you been
Why didn't you come to see me
Shhhh
What is this
hearing
(hissing) Be clever
Be quiet, All rise
Everyone gets up as  , Dr
Zaius and Dr
Maximus enter and mount the dais
The President takes the center chair; the other two flanking him
Be seated
All sit down
(pounds gavel once) This ad hoc Tribunal of the National Academy is now in session
President of the Academy presiding
On my right, Dr
Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs
On my left, Dr
Zaius, Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith
(glancing at Prosecutor) Appearing for the State, Dr
Honorius, Deputy Minister of Justice
Honorius rises and bows
(raps gavel once) Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal
(a beat) You may proceed, Dr
Honorius
(rising) By your leave, Mr
President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry
The President appears to be taken aback
He glances at his colleagues
You asked for the opportunity to present your case
Surely you must know why you're here
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation
(promptly) And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him
(rising) Objection
The accused is indeed a man
Therefore, he has no rights under ape law
Well, Dr
Zira
This is a man, is he not
274	   -  ' Sensing that the President has given them an opening, Zira smiles confidently
He is unlike any man you have ever seen - as we hope to prove
' (o
s
) Answer the question
Is he a man
(tentatively) Sir
The question is the point at issue: Is he a man
Or a deviate
Or a freak of nature
' (o
s
) Objection
275	  - As the Prosecutor continues: Sustained
In all fairness, Dr
Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law
(rising) Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something
Honorius seems confounded
Zaius takes over
This man is not being tried
He is being disposed of
(pointing at Zira and Cornelius) It is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here
Well put, Dr
Zaius
Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal
276	  - Both Cornelius and Zira appear shaken by this threat
Sensing their predicament, Taylor rises impatiently
Then 'll defend myself
277	  - Although the judges and Prosecutor have been told that this man can speak, they react in stunned silence to the first sound of his voice
Flustered, the President bangs his gavel
Dr
Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down
My name is Taylor
The President refuses to address Taylor directly
Checking a document, he speaks to Zira
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes
You gave him that name yourself
(voice rising) This hearing is absurd
Let me tell my story
(pounds gavel) Bailiff
Make the animal be quiet
The Bailiff quickly crosses to Taylor and shoves him roughly into his chair
State your case, Mr
Prosecutor
Learned Judges: My case is simple
It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet
278	   -  ' Taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper
Zira and Cornelius remain attentive to: ' (o
s
) These sacred truths are self-evident
The proper study of apes is apes
But certain young cynics have chosen to study man - yes, perverted scientists who advance on insidious theory called 'evolution
' 279	  - As the Prosecutor continues: There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith Come to the point, Dr
Honorius
Directly, Mr
President
This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy
We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture
The State charges that Dr
Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster
(on her feet) ThatOs a lie
(pounding gavel) Mind your tongue, madame
Did we create his mind too
Not only can this man speak
He can write
He can reason
He can reason
With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination
Proceed
But don't turn this hearing into a farce
Honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors Taylor with an evil smile
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith
admit,  know nothing of your culture
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think
(to Taylor) Tell us why all apes are created equal
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others
Ridiculous
That answer is a contradiction in terms
Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls
What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain
(hands paper to Zira) Show this to the President
Zira moves toward the dais
Honorius returns to his own table
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record
Read it yourself
(reading aloud) ' have come to you from a planet in a different solar system
am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization
On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained
" (rapping gavel) Stop right there
Bring me that paper
Zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the President
He glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to Zaius
(to Zira) This is a joke in very poor taste
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man
(glancing at document) Dr
Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert
do not state it, sir
The prisoner does
Do you believe him
(uneasily) Like you,  find it difficult
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished
(glancing again at document) You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture
This is his assertion
Where are they now
(blurting it out) One is in a museum
(pounding gavel) Dr
Zira
Silence that man
Returning to her table, Zira gestures to Taylor to remain silent
How sad
Stuffed and mounted, eh
Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories
And his other companion
He doesn't know
Mr
President,  believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes
That's true, Dr
Zaius
My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater
Very well
suggest we go and look at them
The President rises, starts out, followed by the others
Taylor is last, being led on a leash by the bailiff
280 281
-   - The inquiry group files through a door into the amphitheater
Two stand guard over a number of leashed and nearly naked human beings in the center of the pit below the dais
There are three primitive males, the female Nova -- and Landon
He is dirty and bearded, but his hair is cropped close
282	 - He turns to Zira, his eyes shining with vindication
(a whisper) It's him
Landon
Which one
Second from the left
283	  - Zaius glances at the accused
Well
do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures
With one of them
Identify him, then
Speak to him
Taylor moves forward for a few paces, stops
Landon
284	  -   -  '
Landon looks catatonic
His face is in shadow 285	  - Stunned by Landon's imbecility
John
it's me, Taylor
Taylor steps forward to grasp his arm
There is still no response
Taylor takes Landon's head in his hands and looks at his face
There is a fresh scar running from his forehead to the top of his cranium
286	  - As Taylor whirls on Zira
You
You knew about this
No,  swear --  never saw this man before
(whirling on Zaius) You did this to him
You've removed his frontal lobes
Silence
(turning) Bailiff, take the prisoner inside
The bailiff Jerks brutally on Taylor's leash, pulling him toward the door leading under the amphitheater
-286
-
- The bailiff enters, dragging Taylor behind him, shoves him into his chair
Moments later the other apes enter the room
All take their seats but Zaius
Taylor glares at him furiously
(calmly) Mr
President, a word of explanation: the creature in question suffered a skull fracture during the hunt
Two fine veternary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life
But the beast could not speak, of course
Nor will he ever speak Taylor leaps from his chair, livid with rage, approaches the dais
You destroyed his memory
His mind
His identity
And, you want to do the same to me
(pounding gavel) Bailiff
Stop this outburst
Gag that monstrosity
The bailiff and a husky guard seize Taylor, who continues shouting: You barbarians
The powerful guard twists Taylor's arms behind his back and the bailiff lashes his wrists together
Then the bailiff gags Taylor
His voice is cut off as the bailiff ties the twisted kerchief around his open mouth
The guard holds Taylor's leash during the rest of this scene
Meanwhile, Cornelius has risen to his feet
His tone is firm, but conciliatory
May it please the Tribunal:  for one grant that this being cannot have come from another planet
But this much is certain -- he comes from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone
He has described the region to us, and described it accurately, for have been there
You visited the Forbidden Zone
Why, yes, sir
year ago
With the special permission of the Academy
(to President) He exceeded his orders
His travel permit was promptly revoked
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you
But not before  discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written
Objection
These remarks are profane and irrelevant
Sustained
(to Cornelius) Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature
(softly) Let them talk, Mr President
Let them talk
(rising) Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity
How so
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false
But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own
Yes, sprang
(a beat) As an animal psychologist,  have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute
Objection
Sustained
(plunging on) Their speech organs are adequate
The flaw lies not in anatomy but in the brain
Objection
Sustained
(voice rising) Sustain all objections, but face the truth
Cornelius has regained his courage
Rising to Zira's support, he points at Taylor
Yes
Behold this marvel, this living paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain
(pounding gavel) Silence
(Puffing with rage) You have gone too far
(calmly) There you are, Mr
President
warned you these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion
You were right
The advocates of heresy have revealed themselves
Mr
President,  think an indictment is in order
(promptly) Yes, sir
The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy
Be it so ordered
The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question
(pounds gavel once) This hearing is adjourned
All rise
The guard drags Taylor from the inquiry room
Zira and Cornelius stand there, stunned by the entrapment into which Zaius has maneuvered them
287- 289 : 290
-
- The office is as unadorned and Spartan as that of Cornelius  -- in fact, with minor changes in decor, the same set can be used
There are many thick leatherbound books on this scholar's desk
Zaius is reading one of them and taking notes
He looks up as someone  at the door
291	  - The two agents push Taylor through the doorway
Wait outside
The officers withdraw, closing the door
Collared, wrists manacled, Taylor stands facing the desk
The verdict is in
At the moment your simian friends -- and  sponsors -- are free on bail
But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy
292	  - who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import
We note at once a change In Zaius' tone and attitude
He no longer treats Taylor like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who must be intimidated by the threat of terror
What about me
(offhandedly) Oh, your case was preordained
In a way, you performed a service for the State
(smiling) Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius
(a beat) And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for
final disposition
Do you know what that means
No
Emasculation, to begin with
Then experimental surgery
On the speech centers
On the brain
Ultimately, a kind of living death
Taylor stiffens but says nothing
Zaius lets this prospect sink in, then continues
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve
That is why  summoned you here tonight
(a beat) Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you
told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours
You lied
Where is your tribe
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system
Then how is it we speak the same language
(suddenly intense) Even in your lies, some truth slips through
That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'
What about it
fort
Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent
(more calmly) Where were you nurtured
take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that 'm a monster created by Dr
Zira
Certainly not
You're a mutant
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim
You're talking heresy, doctor
(smiling) Of course
(growing bolder) All right, suppose  am a mutant
Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic
Because you're not unique
There was the one you call Landon -- Then you admit -- admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another
And another
nest of them
Where's your nest, Taylor
Where are your women
(pause) Thank you for calling me Taylor
(more firmly) Dr
Zaius,  know who  am
Who are you
How did this upside down civilization ever get started
(strangely calm) You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level
And deservedly
(pause) The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there
(a beat) Save yourself, Taylor
Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone
don't know
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity
'm not protecting anybody
That hearing was a farce
What have  done
You're a menace
walking pestilence do know who you are, Taylor
As  know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone
(decisively) You have just six hours to make a full confession
After that 'll employ surgery to obtain one
(calling off) Guards
The two burly security agents open the door and enter
Take this creature back to his cage
The guards seize Taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway
He twists around, faces Zaius
All right, you can cut me to pieces
It's within your power
(with force) But know this, doctor
You do it because you're afraid of me
You do it from fear
Zaius jerks his head silently toward the door
The apes drag Taylor through it
: 293
-
- few hours have passed
Nova is watching Taylor from her cage across the aisle
He sits on the pile of straw
There is an ugly welt on his cheek made by the security officer's whip
are heard
Taylor and Nova look up and off
294	  -   : solemn, teen-age chimp named  appears outside the cage
The guard Julius rises from his chair
Are you Julius
What do you want
'm from the Office of Animal Affairs
(indicating Taylor) This male's to be transferred to the zoo
At this hour
Who says so
Taylor enters scene, coming over to the cage bars as Lucius continues gravely, with just a note of disdain
Don't they tell you anything
The Anti- vivisectionist Society is up in arms
They're going to save this beast from those butchers in the lab
If he can speak he belongs in the public zoo
(taking off) But what'll probably happen is that some money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus
And then we'll have to pay to see what rightfully should have -- Stop making speeches and show me the order
Lucius hands the guard a document
It is dark here, so Julius crosses to a beam of light near the bars and studies the document
Lucius, behind the guard's back, signals frantically for Taylor to seize or strike the guard
Taylor is slow to understand
Lucius shakes his head impatiently
(peering at document) This order's no good
It must be counter- signed by Dr
Zaius -- Lucius suddenly gives Julius a violent shove
The guard's head crashes against the bars and he is stunned
Hit him
Taylor complies  bringing down the heel of his fist on the nape of the guard's neck
Julius collapses
The youngster immediately squats down, gags him, and begins to bind him hand and foot
Who are you
(looking up,coolly) So you can talk
(as he works) 'm Dr
Zira's nephew
This abduction was her idea
You're not really going to the zoo
That's just our cover story in case we're stopped
(off again) Although  do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property -- Come on
Get me out of here
Taking the guard's keys, Lucius rises and unlocks the cage
Nova enters the scene, coming to the bars of her cage
295	   - He gazes at her, tense with indecision
She flashes an imploring smile, a mute appeal that cannot be denied
Over this we hear: ' (o
s
) We've got to move fast
296	  - as Taylor leaves his cage
She comes along too
Zira doesn't want your female
want her
(a shrug) If you insist
But 'm not taking any orders -- Fine
Just let her out
Lucius unlocks Nova's cage
She comes out quickly, takes Taylor's hand
They follow Lucius out of the compound
297
-
- horse-drawn caged wagon (like that used in the hunt) stands near the building
Zira waits at the rear of the wagon
Lucius, Taylor and Nova emerge from a doorway or archway and join her
Zira notes Nova's presence with disapproval
They speak in undertones
(to Lucius) told you not to bring the other one
He wouldn't leave her
(with a sigh) All right
(to the humans) Get in
hurry
Put this on
Listen- Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this
Remember that men all look alike to most apes
Taylor and Nova comply, climbing into the cage
Lucius closes the tailgate
Lucius and Zira move to the front of the wagon and climb aboard
Lucius takes the reins
As they move off: : 298
-     - As previously established, the animal compound is on the outskirts of Apetown
The abductors must cross the causeway on their route of escape
In the distance, near the gazebo, we can see the lights of several torches
The caged wagon rolls into scene and out onto the causeway
At the same time a mounted gorilla leading two pack animals appears on the far side of the causeway, coming toward
Lucius stops the wagon
299	   -    - (apprehensively) Gorilla hunters
Keep moving
We can't turn back now
300	  - As the mounted hunter nears the wagon, we can see two bodies slung across the backs of the pack animals
301	  -    - They look out at: 302	   -
The bodies on the horses are naked human corpses
303
-   - In immediate f
g
, near the gazebo, is a similar wagon
It has lost a wheel, and its rear axle lies on the edge of the causeway
Two naked primitive males can be dimly seen within the cage
Four or five armed gorilla hunters stand near the wagon: two of them carry torches; the others are passing a jug from hand to hand-
The leader of the Hunt Club, still on horseback, holds up his hand as the lab wagon approaches
Hold it
Lucius obeys
The hunters on foot swarm around his wagon as their leader calls authoritatively: Ah, Doctor Zira
Our wagon broke down
'm afraid we'll have to commandeer yours
304	  - as the Hunt Club Leader rides over, recognizing the animal psychologist
You can't
've two sick humans in the cage
We're taking them to the chief vet at the zoo
(indicating his own wagon) We bagged two live ones today
'll have to ask you to take them along
He moves to the rear of the wagon
(following him; frantically) No, no, my animals are diseased
Leave them alone
They're diseased,  tell you
Lucius jumps down and runs toward the rear of the wagon
305	  - The hunters have opened the tailgate and are shining their torches on the humans
They sound ready for sport
Give him a taste of fire
One of the hunters points his torch at Taylor, who, quite naturally, shrinks back as Lucius runs into scene
Stand back
He's dangerous
Why
He's rabid
His bite is fatal
You serious
You would die in agony
(with appropriate gestures) Frothing at the mouth
The hunters fall back
Lucius promptly locks the tailgate and he and Zira run back to the front of the wagon
Lucius snaps the reins and the wagon moves off
The hunters follow it a few paces, pausing near their mounted leader
They treat those animals better than they treat us
still say the only good human is a dead human
The fugitives' wagon recedes beyond the gazebo, as we: : 306
-   - The horse-drawn wagon is silhouetted-against the dawn light, bumping across a semi-arid plain studded with mesquite and sage
(This can be  either on the Navajo reservation near Page or on the Ranch)
: 307
(  ) -   - This is the same area described on page 24, where the hunt occurred
As the wagon rolls along a dirt track, the tall grasses of the savanna (or cultivated field) can be seen in b
g
308	   -    - Taylor is dozing, but the girl is alert and nervous
She peers out at the field, apparently recognizing or remembering this terrain
She nudges Taylor, waking him
309
-    - This, too, is the location described on page 24
with the wagon as it rolls into the grove and  on three horses
Cornelius sits astride one horse; the other two nags are heavily burdened with packs and saddlebags
310	  -   - He dismounts as Zira and Lucius jump down from the wagon and hurry toward him
Cornelius and his fiancee embrace and kiss lightly, ape-fashion
How did it go
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us
(calmly) pursuaded them our beasts had rabies
311	   -    - The apes discussing the abduction are out of earshot
Exasperated to be thus ignored and caged, Taylor kicks the tailgate, shouting: Let me out of here
312	  - Lucius hurries back to unlock the tailgate
Taylor gets out of the wagon, stretching his stiffened joints
Nova follows suit
During the ensuing exchange the girl seems strangely agitated, pacing to and fro, her eyes scanning the grove and fields in search of someone or something
(approaching) Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now
Do you have any weapons
The best
But we won't need them
Just the same,  want one
He moves toward one of the horses
Cornelius starts after him
Look here, Taylor
'm in charge of this expedition -- Taylor takes a rifle from one of the packs, examines it
Fair enough
But you're no longer in charge of me
And  don't mean to be captured again
Zira and Lucius have come up
(peeved) As you wish
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone
That's what  we'll try for
What about you
Cornelius and  have been indicted for heresy
Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone
To the diggings  worked at a year ago
It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours
You still don't believe me, do you
(shrugs) It's a long detour to Dead Lake
What would we find
Taylor makes a helpless gesture, realizing that he cannot present sure proof
Nothing much
The remnants of a life raft
Maybe a small flag
The emblem of my countrymen
Sorry, Taylor
The terrain around that lake is poisonous
There is no fresh water, no vegetation
Nothing
know
Nevertheless,  thank you for saving us
You'll be in trouble for going there
(a smile) We've been in trouble since the moment we met you
Nova seizes Taylor's arm to get his attention
Trying to communicate, she makes whimpering sounds and points at: 313- 314 315	   - This is the same view of the jungle that Taylor saw when the gorilla hunters emerged from the trees
(Page 25) ' (o
s
) What's she pointing at
316 Taylor smiles at Nova, gives her a reassuring shrug
That's the way home
And she knows it
Nova turns away, still holding Taylor's arm, tries to lead him toward the jungle
(sharply) Nova
(she turns; he shakes his head, says gently) We can't stay there
It's not safe
She looks at him sadly
We'd better get started
If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least
Right
(to Lucius) Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon
He and Lucius move off toward the horses
(indicating Nova) Are you going to take her with you
Yes
Actually, you're a different breed
This creature will never evolve
Maybe not
(smiling) You want her that much
(testily) You threw us together, remember
And you guessed right
Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate
He walks off to help Lucius and Cornelius
Nova tags along behind him as we: : -316 : 317
-   - The caravan is crossing, in a reverse direction, the route taken by the astronauts on page 17
The three apes are on horseback
Taylor and Nova follow in the wagon
They are nearing the row of sinister scarecrows on the bluff above the dry wash
318
- They halt briefly and look up at the crosses
Lucius is impressed
Who put them up
The Hunt Club
To scare off humans
To scare us, too
We're entering the Forbidden Zone
They move off again, riding across the dry wash
319	  -    - They, too, have stopped and are looking up at the scarecrows
Nova is plainly terrified
She grabs Taylor's arm, whimpers
Don't worry
You'll be safe with me
(sudden smile) Here
It's time you learned to earn your keep
He hands the reins to Nova
She just sits there
He demonstrates
You can do it
Like this
Nova flicks the reins, reacting in wide-eyed, open-mouthed disbelief as the horse obeys her
: 320
-     - The party is traversing a red desert to the east of Dead Lake
Great sandstone monoliths rise from the desert floor
From this vantage point the horses look no bigger than ants
: 321
-   - This is terrain never before seen in this picture
(Lake Powell location, a few miles northeast of Wahweap)
The party can be seen on the rim of a flat desert tableland that falls away abruptly to a vast, irregular river of deep blue water
Taylor, Cornelius and Lucius are unloading the wagon and repacking their provisions and equipment on the backs of horses
Zira watches them
-321	  - Zira wanders off, falls to her knees
Something's wrong with your mate
Taylor looks off
He and the others move quickly to Nova, with them
-321	   - She has been retching
Taylor lifts her up
She is faint with nausea
Zira squats down beside them
Let me handle this
(ruefully, to Taylor) You may be smarter than  am, but 'm the veterinary on this planet
Assisting Nova to her feet, Zira leads her off toward the wagon
-321
- ,
Taylor watches the departing females, then looks down at the river
Where does the river lead
It empties into a sea some miles from here
That's where the cave is
-321	  -   -
The river winds o
s
between the sheer sandstone Cliffs rising from either bank
' (o
s
) And beyond that
-321	  - , Don't know
At high tide you can't ride along the shore, and we had no boats on the last expedition
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone
No one really knows
It's an ancient taboo
Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls
The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly
Shouldn't we be moving on
'm for that
They start toward the horses and wagon
-321	  - Zira is looking curiously at Nova, who stands in the shade leaning against the wagon as the males enter the scene
Nova's nausea has passed, and she comes smiling to Taylor
What's the diagnosis, doctor
touch of the sun
She's not sick at all
(a beat) She's pregnant
-321	 - Consternation slowly gives way to wonder
He grins
So 'm not an altogether different breed, you see
: 322- 325	     -   - To reach the camp site -- a beach at the base of the gorge -- the party must lead the horses along a narrow trail that zigzags down the face of the sandstone cliffs
They have abandoned the wagon
: 326
-   - Sand bars and two narrow beaches are in evidence here
The camp itself consists of several lean-tos against the cliff wall
Above the camp, reached by ladders connected to scaffolding, is the mouth of a cave
Zira is cleaning up the breakfast things; Zaius and Lucius are sorting out equipment
-326	  - small bowl of water rests on the ground in front of Taylor He has nearly finished shaving himself with a sharp hunting knife
Nova watches, a look of fascinated approval on her face
Taylor rinses off his knife, starts to dry it
Nova reaches out, gently strokes his smooth -- if nicked -- chin
(smiling) You like it
Lucius and Cornelius come up, Zira with them
(disapprovingly) Why did you do that
Scrape off your hair
In my world -- before  left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair
(to Taylor, quizzically) It makes you look somehow
less intelligent
Taylor grins wryly at Cornelius, picks up his rifle
When are you going to show me what's in the cave
Right now, if you like
They cross the beach to the ladders, when suddenly they hear the sound of horses
They look o
s
-326	  : Dr
Zaius and five armed and mounted apes have come around the corner of the beach and ride toward them through the rocks
-326	 - Taylor scrambles up onto the lower scaffold
Lucius runs to a lean-to, scoops up his rifle
Lucius -- don't fire at them
The party rides up
You're all under arrest
(to Lucius) You seditious scoundrel
Drop that rifle
327- 348 349	  - He wavers, lowering his piece
350	  - Zaius' gorillas ride forward a few paces, but halt again as Taylor shouts: Stop right there
Don't be a fool
You're outnumbered and outgunned
Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out: If there's any shooting, Dr
Zaius, you'll be the first to die
Depend on it
(protesting) Taylor, you're not in command here
Put down that gun
Shut up
Silence
Zaius knows Taylor isn't bluffing
Very well
(to his followers) Lower your weapons
They obey
Taylor calls again: (pointing) Tell them to move around the point
Out of range
Zaius turns and whispers to his apes
They rein about and ride away through the rocks
Zaius dismounts and approaches the fugitives alone
He is unarmed
351	  - As Zaius draws nearer) Lucius lowers his rifle
But Taylor keeps his at the ready
(uncertainly) How did you know we'd come here
It wasn't difficult
Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone
(a glance at Taylor) see you brought along the female of your species
(Taylor nods) didn't realize a man could be monogamous
On this planet -- it's easy
Zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes
(evenly) ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken
If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years
But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason
(respectfully) We've never meant to be treasonable, sir
(pointing off) But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts
've seen some of your fossils and artifacts
They're worthless
(derisively) And that's your Minister of Science
Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge
(worried) Taylor, please -- Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith
(loftily) There is no contradiction between faith and science
True science
(suddenly angered) All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test
Taylor, 'd rather you - No
You saved me from this fanatic
Maybe can pay you back
(calmly) What is your proposal
When were the Sacred Scrolls written
Twelve hundred years ago
Very well
If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them
Of course
Okay
Up to the cave
He gestures toward the path leading to it
Zaius, Zira, and Cornelius start upward
Lucius starts to follow them
Sorry, Lucius
You'll have to stay here and guard the horses
Always giving orders
Just like every other adult
Relax
You'll see it all later
He pats the barrel of Lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but benevolent non-com, then starts up the trail with Nova at his heels
Lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him, then shrugs, adjusting to the Idea
352- 355 356
-   - The sun hovers over the lofty rim of the lake like a great red balloon
The wall of the gorge, in shadow, is a darker hue
357
-   - The crenelated east wall, looking like a red cathedral, is aglow with sunlight
So is the mouth of the cave as the three apes, Taylor and Nova pass through it and o
s
358
-   - Nature has formed a vaulted room here
It need not be enormous, but should be as weird and fantastic as production capabilities permit
There is an ape-made excavation in the floor of the cave, some ten feet square and eight feet deep
Some small objects lie on the rim of the excavation
Zaius, Cornelius, Zira, Taylor and Nova enter from the outside
(' : The effect should be an eyeful
wish to create an illusion of sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct, refracted illumination, transforming it into a kaleidoscopic cavern
) Present your evidence, Cornelius
Cornelius clambers down into the pit, followed by Zira
Taylor bends down, examines some of the artifacts lined along the edge of the excavation
Nova sits beside him
(pointing) It was at this level  discovered traces of an early ape creature -- stage of primitive barbarism, really -- dating back roughly thirteen hundred years
It was here found cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas
( )    as Cornelius continues: But the artifacts lying at your feet were found here, at this level
And that's the paradox
The more ancient culture is the more advanced
Admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified, but clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy
on the group in and around the excavation as Cornelius continues: Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own
Some of the evidence is uncontestable
(interrupting) Don't speak to me in absolutes
The evidence is contestable
apologize
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least
There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations
Perhaps that's why they're on your staff
Zaius flicks a hostile glance at Taylor, then looks down at the artifacts
He nudges them with his foot
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything
(promptly) But there's the doll, sir
What
(pointing) Right there
The human doll
Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up
359	   -  ' It is only a porcelain fragment, but the head is intact, and it is unmistakably the form of a human child
What does this prove
My grand- daughter plays with human dolls
360	  -   - Exasperated, Zira turns to the man for confirmation
Taylor
Tell him
He has a point
On my planet children often play with ape dolls
Zaius idly tosses the doll to the ground near Nova
She picks it up, studies it
361	  - Cornelius tries again
doll alone proves nothing
True
But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit
Your conclusion is premature
Have you forgotten your Scripture
The Thirteenth Scroll
(quoting from memory) 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him
' (impatiently) No sir,  haven't forgotten
Well
For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets
Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed
Keep digging Cornelius
You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape
-361	  - As Zira again appeals to the man
Are you going to let that pass without an answer
Taylor, who has been toying with objects in the dirt, looks up
Yes
have to agree
From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours
(annoyed) What are you doing there
Reconstructing a life
Care to have a look
Cornelius and Zira cross the pit and Zaius walks around the rim of the excavation
-361
- As the apes come close
number of artifacts have been arranged in front of Taylor
(to Cornelius) These were found near the human doll, right
(Cornelius nods) Well, whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape
He picks up the twisted fragment of a pair of spectacles
Defective eyesight
As Taylor continues his monologue, he picks up the other objects one by one
He wore false teeth
(pause) He suffered from a hernia and used this truss to hold up his insides
(pause) And toward the end, these little rings of stainless steel enclosed a prefab- ricated valve in his failing heart
Taylor pauses
Zaius picks up two of the steel rings, studies them
don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but 'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills
(to Zaius pointedly) Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you
(a calm smile) That's lunacy
can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours
But it would be conjecture, not proof
362	  - She is poking her finger inside the decapitated head of the doll
From it comes a distorted
' Mamma
Mamma
Mamma
The apes stare at the doll in astonishment
Taylor snatches the doll from Nova, brandishes it at the astonished Zaius
Dr
Zaius
Would an ape make a human doll that talks
Zaius looks at him, speechless
At that moment the  of a distant rifle shot reverberates through the cavern
All present freeze, listening
Lucius
363- 364 365	  -   - Taylor alone is armed
Raising his rifle, he glowers at Zaius
You louse
Cornelius is already crossing the pit
He climbs out arid races toward the mouth of the cave
Taylor runs after him
Zira and Nova hurry after Taylor
366
- Expressionless, he looks down at the doll, then moves toward the mouth of the cave
367
- Cornelius emerges from mouth of the cave and runs down the trail toward He halts in f
g
, looking down at: 368	   - Two of Zaius' gorillas have disarmed Lucius and are clubbing him with their rifle butts
Two other mounted apes are driving the scientists' horses back beyond the trees
369
- Cornelius, Taylor, Nova and Zira (in that order) can be seen high above, descending the trail in immediate f
g
, crouching behind a boulder near the water
He sights his rifle at the man on the trail
Taylor is still too distant to make a sure target, and so the sniper waits
370	  - This portion of the trail has no cover or concealment
Unaware of the sniper, Taylor looks down at the camp as he makes his descent
371	  -  -     ' The gorilla fires
372	  - The bullet ricochets off the rock wall a foot above his head
Taylor scans the terrain bewlow, looking for the sniper
Nova comes to his side, pointing at: 373	  -
His head is visible behind the boulder as he reloads his piece
374 He aims and fires
375	  - Taylor has missed him, but the sniper ducks behind the boulder
376	  - Taylor takes her hand and they race back up the trail to where Zira is standing
Outcroppings of rock offer some  cover here
Taylor pushes Nova down behind a rock and signals for Zira to follow suit
377	   - , The sniper's   rings out
Instead of returning the fire, Taylor looks up the rail at: 378	 - FRO14 '
He is standing impassively on the trail a short distance below the mouth of the cave
379	  - Bent low, he comes charging up the trail toward Zaius
The sniper's splatters rock fragments around him
380	  -   - Zaius starts to retreat to the cave, but stumbles and falls on some loose shale
No sooner has Zaius regained his feet than Taylor overtakes him
Seizing the ape around the neck with his left arm
Taylor drives the muzzle of his pistol into Zaius' kidney
He spins Zaius around, using him as a shield
381	   - Taylor releases the pressure on Zaius' throat but keeps the gun pointed at his back
Tell him to pull back
(a hoarse cry) Cease fire
Withdraw
His command echoes from the west wall of the canyon
382	  -      -
The sniper emerges from behind a boulder near the shore, and walks off along the beach
383 Taylor lift's the muzzle of his rifle and presses it against the back of Zaius' head
ought to kill you right now
(nudging him) Let's go
They move off down the trail
384
-
- Zira rushes down the trail to Lucius, who is sprawled on the ground
He has a bloody nose and a lump on his forehead
Nova and Cornelius come next, then Taylor, prodding Zaius ahead of him at gun point
Lucius appears to be more humiliated than hurt
They took me by surprise
Sneaked up on me while  was watering the horses
What's happened to honor
(pause, glum) got off one round to warn you
(gloomingly) They've taken everything
Not everything
They left a hostage
(a pause) How do you feel, Lucius
Disillusioned
(turning on) But vindicated
've been right all along
You can't trust the older generation
It's a matter of values -- (gently) All right, all right
Will You do me a favor
No orders
(pause) What is it
want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner
(thoughtfull pause) Yes,  can do that
TAYL0R Good
Say  want a week's supply of food for the woman and myself
horse
spade
And fifty rounds of ammunition
What if they won't agree to your terms
Then tell them Dr
Zaius won't leave here alive
(shocked) Taylor, you can't
(Calmly) Oh yes he can
He's a born killer
(to Lucius) Deliver the message
Lucius looks to Taylor for confirmation
Taylor nods
The young ape hurries away through the rocks
Taylor crosses to a useless saddle, picks up a coil of rope, gestures at Zaius, indicating a nearby tree
Sit down
Over there
Zaius squats on the ground beside the tree
Taylor sets his rifle against the trunk, fashions a noose and places it around Zaius' neck
Then, using an ingenious combination of knots, he ties Zaius' hands behind his back, and finally fastens the rope around the base of the tree
(as he works) Now, 	Minister of Science - let me explain certain principle stress and strain
If you exert pressure to remove these bonds, you'll choke yourself to death
It'll be suicide, you see
Zira and Cornelius look down at the captive mandarin
Their rebellious spirit has evaporated, and they are clearly afraid
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way
Why not
It's humiliating
Wasn't  humiliated
By all of you
Didn't you lead me around on a leash
That was different
We thought you were
inferior
(wintry smile) And now you know the truth
(to Zaius) Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor
He proved it
Man preceded you here
You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have
(quietly) Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive
(shrugging) He might have been wiped out by a plague
Natural catastrophe
Like a fiery storm of meteors
From the looks of this part of your planet, 'd say that was a fair bet
, (weakly) But we can't be sure
(indicating Zaius) He is
He knew all the time
Long before your discovery, he knew
(to Zaius) Defender of the Faith
Guardian of the terrible secret
Isn't that right, doctor
385- 388 389	  -	 - As Zira and Cornelius look at him expectantly
What  know of man was written long ago -- set down by the wisest ape of all -- our Lawgiver
(to Cornelius) Open my breast pocket
Cornelius crosses to Zaius, and takes a small book bound in black leather from the breast pocket of his tunic
Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll, ninth Verse
Cornelius thumbs through the book, finds the citation and reads aloud: 'Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport, or lust or greed
Yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land
Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours
Shun him
Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is the harbinger of death'
Cornelius falls silent and looks down at Zaius
(quietly) found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man
And  still live by its injunction
-389	  - Lucius hurries out of the rocks leading a saddled horse
Zaius' five mounted gorillas appear behind him
Taylor calls out to them: Stay where you 	are
Lucius comes up with the horse
Taylor checks the provisions in the saddlebags
Lucius is frowning
They think you're behaving foolishly must say  agree
Where will you go
(nodding o
s
) 'll start by following the shoreline
(a smile) And my nose
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland
How will you survive
(firmly) He won't survive
(all look at him) Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor
That of an animal
If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you
Then there is another jungle
(shrugs; then, sardonically) Of course, you could return with us
Our society might find a place for you and your mate
Sure
In a cage
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong
No, thanks
'll take freedom
Taylor mounts the horse, extends a helping hand to Nova, who vault's nimbly onto the horse's rump
Taylor looks at Zira and Cornelius
Would you like to come along
We can't
It's better than going to prison for heresy
They can't convict us of that
You proved our innocence
Besides
(indicating Zaius) his culture is our culture
Good luck then
He reaches down, grasps Cornelius' hand, then grins crookedly
Dr
Zira, 'd like to kiss you good-bye
All right, but
(tears in her eyes) you're so damned ugly
Taylor smiles, leans down, kisses her
(softly) Go with God, Taylor
(half smile) That's an old expression
it comes from both ape and man
God bless you
He extends his hand to Lucius, who takes it
Lucius
think you're making a mistake
That's the boy
Keep 'em flying
What
The flags of discontent
It's the only way anything ever gets changed
(to Zaius) Don't try to follow us
(pats stock of his rifle) 'm pretty handy with things like this
Of that 'm sure
All my life 've awaited your coming and dreaded it
Like death itself
Taylor looks piercingly at Zaius, more troubled than offended
Why
From the first, 've terrified you, Doctor
And in spite of every sign that 'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me
Why
(calmly, without rancor) Because you are a man
And you were right --  have always known about man
From the evidence,  believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy
His emotions must rule his brain
He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself
What evidence
No weapons were found in the cave
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise
Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago
(he waits, then wearily) We're back at the beginning
still don't know the why
planet where apes evolved from men
world turned wrong side up
puzzle with one piece missing
(softly) Don't look for it, Taylor
You may not like what you find
-389	  - Taylor shakes his head, still baffled, digs his heels into the horse's flank
It canters off along the sandy shore
Zira, Cornelius and Lucius sadly watch the departure
Untie me
Cornelius moves quickly to remove the rope from Zaius' neck
Behind them, the five mounted gorillas gallop forward
Zaius gets up, waves them to a halt
No, no
Let him go
-389	  - Taylor looks back, sees that Zaius has stopped the mounted apes, slows his horse to a trot, smiles at Nova
390- 405 406
- Zaius watches as Taylor's horse moves farther away along the beach
Then he turns to an ape called
(quietly) Fetch your explosives
We're going to seal the cave
Yes, sir
He remounts his horse and rides o
s
(aghast) Seal the cave
That's correct
And you will both stand trial for heresy
But the proof
The doll
In a few minutes there will be no doll
There can't be
(honest regret) 'm sorry
Cornelius throws himself at Zaius
You mustn't
You gave your 'word
Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes
What  do,  do with no pleasure
Silence him
hairy hand is clapped over Cornelius' mouth
He is dragged off, struggling, kicking
Julius, unafraid, glares at Zaius
Dr
Zaius, this is inexcusable
Why must knowledge stand still
What about the future
Zaius looks benevolently at Julius
may just have saved it for you
Julius and Zira look at each other, befuddled
Once more their eyes follow the retreating figures of Taylor and Nova
The beach separating the water from the canyon becomes narrower as they move downstream
What will he find out there, doctor
-406	 - His face is  mask, his tone enigmatic
His destiny
-406	  -
moment later, as they watch, Taylor and Nova vanish around the bend
407- 408 409
-     - Taylor and Nova are already far downstream
There is a striking change in the terrain
The area is still desolate,but some vegetation can be seen on the palisade above the narrow beach, and the river has widened to form a vast tidal basin where it meets the sea
: If feasible at new location site, this scene should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at the base of the cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky
410	  - He is alert, sniffing the salt air, sizing up the situation
Hearing the  of birds, he reins in and looks' up
411	  - Sea gulls are soaring overhead
412	  - His expression is expectant, searching
Nova emits a whimper of anticipation, pointing off
413	  -   : verdant forest atop a distant palisade
Their view of the beach below the forest, is cut off by a rocky promontory in the middle distance
414	  - He smiles at her hopefully
Yes, Nova --  see it
(looks again at forest) In my old profession green meant safe
Green meant go
The horse moves off at a trot,
But they have gone only a short distance when they hear the distant  of an
Taylor reins in and looks back
415	   - column of smoke and dust rises from the exploded cave far upstream
416 Frowning with concern, Taylor gazes for a moment at the smoke, then decides this is no time to linger
He digs his heels into the horse's flanks and they move off at a canter, riding toward the promontory that splits the beach
They are nearing the promontory that blocks their view of the beach beyond
417- 418 419	  -
As they round the promontory, the tip of a strange rock formation comes into view
it appears to be jutting from the sea
420	  - He reins in momentarily, baffled by what he sees
Then he rides on
421	   - An immense column juts from the beach at a thirty-degree angle
We can now see that it is not rock, but metal
Green metallic tints show through its gray salt-stained surface
As we draw closer, the object takes on the appearance of a massive arm, its top shaped like a hand holding a torch
422	  - Frowning with consternation
His horse proceeds at a slow walk
423	   -   : Near the base of the column, where the shore and water meet, are a row of metal spikes
From this angle they look like tank traps
-423	 - Dumbfounded, he slides from his saddle, approaches the  spikes
Nova dismounts and follows him
(a cry of agony) My God
He falls to his knees, buries his head in his hands to a    disclosing what Taylor has found
Half-buried in the sand and washed by the waves is the Statue of Liberty
