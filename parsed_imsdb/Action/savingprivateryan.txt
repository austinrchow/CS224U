The are heard
The power is astonishing
It roars through the body, blows back the hair and rattles the ears
: -  - The     continues but now
Huge fifteen inch guns
Heads directly into a nightmare
from German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the beach
Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers, pour out a red snowstorm of bullets
: , June 6, 1944 0600 Each holding thirty men, near the beaches
At the far end of the beach, a ninety- foot cliff
Topped by bunkers
Ringed by fortified machine gun nests
clear line-of-fire down the entire beach
Make their way toward the base of the cliffs
Running a gauntlet of explosions
: Plows through the waves
Boys
Most are eighteen or nineteen years old
Tough
Well-trained
Trying to block out the fury around them
huge  of fuel, fire, metal and flesh
The Motorman holds his course
Shells  around them
on the water
into the bow
shower the men behind him
The mate takes the controls
His face covered with the remains of the motorman
Starts to lose it
Begins to shudder and weep
His name is DeLancey
Do their best to stare straight ahead
But the fear infects them
It starts to spread
Pushes through the men
Puts himself in front of DeLancey
The figure is
Early thirties
By far the oldest man on the craft
Relaxed, battle-hardened, powerful, ignoring the hell around them
He smiles, puts a cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's helmet and lights the cigar
DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw and forces him to lock eyes
Miller smiles
DeLancey is terrified
Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die
Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops
Delancey Oh, Jesus
Miller  want every one of you to look at the man on your left
Now look at the man on your right
Feel sorry for those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're not going to get a scratch
few, including DeLancey, manage thin smiles
Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves his jaw as if to see if it's broken
Miller pats him on the cheek and moves on to the bow
Looks over the gunwale at ' It quivers in fear
Miller glances around, sees that none of the men have noticed
He stares at his hand as if it belongs to someone else
It stops shaking
He turns his eyes back to the objective
The six surviving boats alongside
From the landing crafts
Arc toward the top of the cliffs

dozen men are
Among them, DeLancey
Somehow survives
Jumps into the breakers

On the edge of the cliff
Rain down    and Struggle through the surf up as best they can

Uses hand signals and curt orders

Obey instantly
Set the grappling hooks
Take position
Return fire
Drown out most voices
Except the Know what they have to do
Start up the ropes
Into the teeth of the German defenders
Back-straps his Thompson sub-machine gun
Starts climbing with the first group
The Americans swarm up the ropes
Taking turns firing up at the Germans

Grabs him by the back of his collar
Roughly yanks him up
Nearly choking him
They boy climbs on

, taking two others with him
All three land on the rocks below
Another way to die
Less steep
They leave the ropes
Free climb, scrambling up the rocks
Joins half-a-dozen pinned down men
Others bottleneck behind them
Miller scans the route and the defenders
Sees an open gap
Deadly
Beyond is a protective overhang
With a clear line to the top
That's the route
Miller motions to six men huddled near him
Go
Take an instant to get ready
Then into the gap
Do their best to cover them
up at the Germans
Bad angle
No Germans are hit
Are    by All
They fall to the rocks below
, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller
Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain
It's the only way
Turns to the next half-dozen men

Move to the head of the gap
Miller moves for a better angle against the machine guns
Calls to , a tall, gangly Southern country boy, sharp-shooter

Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire
Turns to the second six
Take deep breaths

Not enough

All are Turns, looking for the next six
His eyes fall on Sarge and who is a cynical, sharp, New Yorker
Reiben smiles
(heavy Brooklyn accent) Captain, can  put in for a transfer
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork
Moves into place
Sarge and Miller exchange a look
They both see the madness of what they're doing
on the Germans
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath
Scrambles into the gap
The other five right behind
Three are
Then another
bounce down
below
swings toward Sarge and Reiben
Miller sees them about to get it
perfect target
Captain's bars glinting Too much to pass up
He swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward Miller
approaches Miller
he's an instant from death
Under the overhang to safety
,   , Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves
'll be Goddamned
'm not dead
Sarge hollers back to Miller

Quick smiles
lean out and
more Germans
run up the path, under the overhang
Stop near the top
Pull pins on grenades
Count
Both throw long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed
Putt out the two worst machine gun nests
Crosses the gap
His men follow
The Americans swarm over the top
as they retreat
Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers
The Germans are
motions to , a small, wide-eyed, demolition man who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel charges
Okay, Wade, your turn
Wade Captain,  love it when you say that
Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to the first of three bunkers
Dodging bullets from inside
Wade tosses a   into a gun port
, , rocks the bunker
Survey the field
What the hell were you doing
Drawing fire
Worked, didn't it
You tryin' to get yourself killed
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered
Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering the rocks and the beach below
He's clearly affected
Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded
Then he moves on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German bunkers

- Very busy
dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks, quickly and efficiently
No small talk
Older than the others, sad-eyed, adds a sheet of paper to a large pile in his out-box
An outgoing telegram
It reads: "We regret to inform you
killed in action
heroic service
"  This is the paperwork of death
Pulls out a file
Reads
Finds something troubling
Quickly shuffles through some other papers
Finds what he's looking for
Rises from his desk and hurries out of the office
'  -
- Seen through the glass wall
The clerk speaks to a who is visibly shaken by what he is being told
He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the office with the clerk on his heels
'  -
- Again, seen through a glass wall
The Young Lieutenant speaks to a   who, like the Lieutenant is clearly bothered by what he's being told
The Captain takes the papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out
'  -
- busy office
Aides and secretaries scurry about
The walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex deployment charts
-  with a chest full of ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee
He clearly hasn't slept in a long time
The Young Captain, his staff officer, walks in
Young captain Colonel, 've got something you should know about
One-armed colonel Yes
Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy
One at Omaha Beach, the other at Utah
Last week in Guam a third brother was killed in action
All three telegrams went out this morning
Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams this afternoon
The life drains from the Colonel
Others in the room hear and freeze
One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus
Young captain There's more
There's a fourth brother
The youngest
He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First Airborne the night before the invasion
He's on the front
One-armed colonel Is he alive
Young captain We don't know
The Colonel regains his bearings
Stands and motions curtly to the Captain
One-armed colonel Come with me
The Colonel regains his bearings
Stands and motions curtly to the Captain
One-armed colonel Come with me
The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his heels
The aides and secretaries watch them go

Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn

stand of trees
Cornfields as far as the eye can see

Sits empty
Moves slightly
Four American flag decals
Each one, a man in service
Steps out
Around sixty
Her face shows the lines of a life of hard work and mother hood
good woman
She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the fields
Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind the black car
She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her house
She starts to grow uneasy
As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard
She reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post
The car pulls up to the house
She sees three men get out, one wearing a clerical collar
The first of her tears come
'  -   - Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries
, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files
Half- a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and the Young Captain, wait
General Marshall puts down the file
(softly) Goddamn it
One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau
Any contact with the fourth brother, James
One-armed colonel No, sir
He was dropped about thirty miles inland, near Ramelle
That's still deep behind German lines
General Marshall hardens
Well, if he's alive, we're going to send someone to get him the hell out of there
That's just what the General's staff wanted to hear
-   - Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force of German troops
The Americans hug the bottoms of the craters,   as best they can
in the distance
: Normandy 1300 hours June 9 Trailed by a , dashes through the fire and dives into a sludge- filled crater
He surfaces, sees Sarge and Reiben, and reels from a horrific smell
Their conversation is repeatedly broken by  And Jesus Christ
What the hell are we swimming in
Shit, sir
Fertilizer, Captain,  think we're in a cranberry bog
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine
Look at the bright side, the Krauts sure as hell don't want to advance and hold this cesspool
Miller barks to his
Get Fire Control, we need some artillery
Radioman Trying, sir
They all duck
Reiben's worried
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen
Who cares
care
Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge
Frogs
Lingerie
Yeah
So
diminishes for an instant
Miller, Sarge and Reiben immediately rise and   at the German positions
and they duck down again
So, you ever heard of employee discounts
My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie
Lingerie is my life, sir
My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn,  grew up in it, from the time  could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all  been thinking about since the invasion
Another pause in the German shelling
Reiben rises and , then ducks as the
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies
Miller Dream on, private
Happy to, sir
Radioman Captain, 've got Command, they want you back at , right away
Maybe the war's over
After the debris stops falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge
Reiben looks dubiously at Miller
don't think so, Captain
(to Radioman) Stay at it until you get fire control
(to Sarge) Keep 'em down, wait for the navy
Yes, sir
Miller waits for a pause in the  , then scrambles out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run

Runs over the broken ground and makes it to the sandbagged
He stumbles down the make-shift stairs
- Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the  which continue through the scene
Miller salutes a Major
Miller, Company , Second Rangers
Major Go on in
Miller goes deeper into the
bunker where he finds a dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen
Very busy
field map dominates the center of the small space
The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him respectfully
He's clearly someone special
is in command, talking on a field-phone
He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of the storm
He sees Miller and motions for him to wait
(into field-phone) understand your problem, but if we don't get those tanks off-loaded by 0600, we're going to have an entire division up at Caen with its ass hanging out of its pants
steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of paper
Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list
My what
Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in- action
Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant
Find a chaplain
(into field-phone) alright, let me know when
Anderson hangs up, speaks to an
Have the Second and Third Regiments hold at St
Michel until we get those tanks
Aide Yes, sir
Colonel Anderson turns to Miller
Report
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc
Resistance
company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence
Casualties
Fourty-four, twenty one dead
An instant of , all hear, none look
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it
Yes, sir
Where are your men now
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns
'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us,  have something else for you
Sir
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle
want you to take a squad up there
If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation
Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company
private, sir
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action
This is straight from the Chief of Staff
But, sir
Spit it out, Captain
, : Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense
(beat) Sir
The other officers freeze, listening without turning
Colonel Anderson glares at Miller
You think just because you hold the Congressional Medal of Honor, you can say any damn thing you please to your superior officers
Miller considers the question, then smiles
Yes, sir, more or less
Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head off, then he smiles, too
Alright, 'll give you that
Continue
The numbers don't make sense, sir
His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation
Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away
One private is simply not worth a squad
Colonel anderson This one is
He's worth a lot more than that
Which is why 'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is
Miller Shrugs
Yes and no, sir, what about Morgan
Fine officer, regular church goer, writes poetry, he might like a mission like this
(beat) And he's taller than me
Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's time to get back to business
That's enough, Captain, you have your orders
Major Thomas will fill you in
Miller knows when to back off
He salutes
Yes, sir
Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look
Good luck, John
Thank you, sir
Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables
Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices the other officers in the tent watching
glare and they go back to work

Beasley's dead
Okay, Wade
Translators

What about Talbot
Twenty minutes ago
Miller Damn, 'll go see if  can find another one
You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport
Yes, sir
They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the crater and crouch-run in opposite directions
-   - Just in from the beaches
Nothing close
Dust
Confusion
Vehicles of every sort moving out
Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks
In the middle of the mess, a cigar-chewing   works at a make- shift desk made out of crate
He yells at a
- Private They're blocked in
'
Wait nearby
Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering
The others are relaxed
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles
He sees his men and walks toward them
Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle,  gotta go to Caen, sir, please,  told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's
oh, please, sir
Sorry,  need a
man, you're the best
(desperate) No, 'm not, Kaback is, honest
Or what about Faulkner
Or that little guy with the glasses
Trust me, you're the best
(whimpering) But, sir
Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides off toward the Supply Sergeant's table
Sarge falls in next to Miller
You get a translator, Captain
've got a line on one
Chaos
Vehicles  by
The Supply Sergeant juggles runners and paperwork
Miller steps up to him
Sergeant,  need a truck
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior
White-walls
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on
(to the Private) ,   , (to Miller) can't help you, sir
half-track, anything
Sorry, sir
Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen
(notices Miller's shoulder patch) How come you guys aren't going
Miller ignores the question
He spies a jeep
How about that jeep
That's General Gavin's
His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, 'll get court marshaled
If you were to take it, they'd shoot me
Cap'n, does that mean we got to walk all the way up to Ramelle
What's at Ramelle beside a lot of Germans
paratrooper named Ryan
He's going home, if he's alive
Senator's son
No, three brothers of his were killed in action
Command wants him out of there
The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly
Damn
got a couple brothers
Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly
The Supply Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep
- Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep
Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam of men and vehicles
Miller rides shotgun
Reiben, Jackson and Wade are crammed in the back
The   Watches them go
Behind him, , pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his huge staff
He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty
, The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns to take his lumps
- Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American staging area
We've got to make one stop
Miller points the way for Sarge
- Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly white, taut-lined tent
steady stream of  vehicles and  men move out around them
-
Miller hops out
Wait here
He strides into the tent
- Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals
They're breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine
Tedious, detailed work
One of them is  , a thin, twenty-four year old, patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses
He nervously jumps at the sound of a , then he forces himself to concentrate on his work
Miller strides in
Miller 'm looking for Corporal Upham
Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses
Upham Sir, 'm Upham
understand you speak French and German
Upham Yes, sir
Do you have an accent
Upham  slight one in French
My German is clean
It has a touch of the Bavarian
Good, you've been re-assigned to me, we're going to Ramelle
Upham knows enough geography to know what that means
Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle
That's my understanding
Upham Lots of them
Do you have a problem with that, Corporal
Upham Sir, 've never been in combat
make maps translate
need a translator, all mine have been killed
Upham But, sir,  haven't held a gun since basic training
It'll come back to you
Get your gear
Upham hesitates
Upham Sir, may  bring my typewriter
Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking
Upham 'm writing a book and
Miller's expression gives him his answer
Upham Uh, how about a pencil
small one
Miller shoos him off
Go, go
Upham scurries away
Miller sighs
- Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the others in the back of the jeep
As they drive off, the to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion in military history
The scope of the operation is stunning
The beach is covered with mountains of supplies
steady stream of vehicles winds up the dunes
Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene
Off- shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers swarming over it like ants
Beyond that, thousands of ships and boats of every type and description
The smoke of hundreds of fires rises on the horizon
, some distant, some close,  and
It's an awesome, breathtaking sight
Miller and his tiny band of men, weave their way through the middle of it, speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the bulk of the American Army behind
Ext
french road - day Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and infantrymen moving forward
The sides of the road are littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned equipment, bodies
Sarge drives
Miller reads a map
Upham, cradling a pristine -1 rifle, is all eyes and ears
Jackson and Wade calmly take in the view
Reiben checks out the close quarters in the back of the jeep
Captain, can  ask you a question
Sure, Reiben
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir
Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map
(continuing) It's just that it's kind of crowded back here,  was wondering if you're expecting to have more room on the way back
Miller points out a turn to Sarge
Left
Sarge makes the turn
Miller folds up the map and pockets it
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St
Mere, then Bernay
We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot
We in radio contact with anybody up there
Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works
We're going in blind
usually like surprises
What are we likely to run into
fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on
Command says we hold St
Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts
Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead
Hell of a mission
Yep, hell of a mission
Upham avidly takes in everything
He notices Reiben staring at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful smile
Upham Hi
So, uh, you're all Rangers
Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an insect
Upham 'm Upham
(pointing at his corporal's stripes) Ignore these, please,  know all that breaks down in combat
Their jaws drop
(to Wade) You want to shoot him, or should
Wade It's not my turn
(politely) Jackson
Hell, no, last time  shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off
Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name
Upham Miller
don't want anybody to shoot him, that's an order
He speaks French and his German has a touch of the Bavarian
Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller
Miller sighs, he knows what's coming
(continuing) who won the Congressional Medal of Hon
Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances of Miller's men
Miller himself remains relaxed but stone- faced
No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as if it had never happened
Captain,  gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me
Yeah, how so
should be on my way to Caen, sir
It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf
Go figure,  mean, who'd he piss off
And here  am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, 'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead
There's to be a bright side, look for it
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for
Cheese
The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France
There is no bright side
There's always a bright side
'm listening, sir
Well, , for one, like cheese
Wade pipes up cheerfully
Wade Hell,  don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's something up there for me to blow up
Well, you're a happy idiot
: is roadmaster
Miller calls to him
How's the road up to St
Mere
Lieutenant Bad, sir
There're some eighty-eights hiding somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic
Anybody getting through
Lieutenant The lucky ones
Miller nods to Sarge who floors it
They take off, spraying gravel behind them
Ext
St
Mere Road - day The jeep barrels down the road, fast
The road is pock-marked with craters
They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps
Direct hits
Sarge swerves around them without slowing
On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of a dozen American troops
It's a nightmare vision
Upham grows weak at the sight
Miller takes note of Upham's reaction
The men bounce up and down like stuffed animals, doing their best to not be thrown out
Hell, this is better than Coney Island
Bounces Reiben up and slams his back down on his shovel
He Just trying to make room for Ryan
Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his shovel from under his bruised ass
See a long, straight stretch of road
Half-a-dozen burning, obliterated American vehicles
gauntlet to run
- Lands right behind them (sweetly) Sarge
Everyone hangs on
Thirty yards ahead of them
Directs Sarge off the road
They've got the road zeroed
Yanks the wheel, driving the jeep off the road
Off the shoulder
Nearly throwing everyone out
Somehow they hang on
The jeep tears along the rutted field
Just behind them
Not slowing down
Trying to avoid the biggest ruts and bumps
Close on their side
Showers them with debris

Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead

Upham is very nervous
That's bracketing, right
They all ignore him

The next one is going to land right on us

Rocks it Makes progress

Uh, Captain
Uh, Captain

It's almost out
Knowing the shell is coming any second
Upham is beside himself

Instantly take off
Away from the jeep

Running as fast as they can
The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between
But there must be a dozen mortars firing
The shells are almost constant
The six Americans run madly, in zig- zag patterns through the gauntlet of , , , Miller yanks him up
Half-drags him to the edge of the field
Keep running
Through the bushes and brambles
Thirty yards in
Panting
Struggling to catch their breath
Check their body parts
Everything's there
They have their weapons, most of their gear
Reiben looks back through the trees at  , which is nothing more than a burning carcass
He shakes his head
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance
Captain,
Sssssh
Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from position to position
Sarge, maps
Sarge quickly opens up the map case
The men are dead silent, frozen in place
Two eighty-eights, just under two- and-a-half miles, that way, vector from the jeep, through those two trees at the base of the hill
The mortars came from behind that rise, there, four of them
Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map
Miller snaps out of it
Wade, the radio
Wade instantly starts cranking it up
Upham is amazed
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire
That's not all
There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe,  don't know, it's hard to tell
Corporal, you have just seen one of Captain Miller's many God-given talents
If, by some miracle, you survive, you will witness many more of them
Sarge finished vectoring
Got it, sir
We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights
That's not what we're here for
(re
radio) 've got command, Captain
Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge
(into radio) This is Baker Charley One, fire mark, sector three, foxtrot quadrant, four- three by baker-three
Two eighty- eights
Tell our boys to come in low from the east in case the Krauts have ack-ack
Good hunting
Over
through the static
Wade packs up the radio
Miller folds up the map
Jackson Sir, wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys
Tell that to Private James Ryan
We've got our orders
Let's go
Miller heads off without pausing or looking back
The rest of the men don't like it, but they follow
Upham trails, amazed at Miller
- Miller walks point
His men follow warily
Upham falls in alongside Reiben
So, where are you from
Get lost
Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson
So, where are you from
You writin' a book or somethin'
As a matter of fact,  am
Figured
Wade overhears and smiles at Upham
'm Wade, that's spelled, ---, 'm small but wiry, with piercing, steel-gray eyes, and a rough-hewn but handsome face, 'm from Colorado, my father's a mining engineer, don't you take notes
Upham shakes his head
Demolition, right
Since  was nine years old
They got a lot of explosives around mines
Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw
Damn, we had fun
Jackson shrugs
'm Jackson
'm from West Fork, Tennessee
My pappy's a preacher
Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel
In West Fork
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer
No kidding
don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family
So they travel around from place to place and preach
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs
Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County
expect that upon completion of my military service  will be joinin' said ministry
What about the Captain
Where's he from
They all shake their heads
Miller's out of earshot
You figure that out, you got yourself one nice prize
Over three hundred bucks, last heard
Wade Company's got a pool, five bucks gets you in, whoever guesses where the Captain's from and what he did as a civilian gets it all
The whole kit and caboodle
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men
We know
Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living
Somebody probably does
Why don't you just ask him
The Captain prefers not to discuss certain aspects of his life, in particular, everything up to and including his enlistment in the United States Army
've been with him since Anzio
'm closer to him that  am to my own brother but  don't even know what state he's from
Somewhere in the Northeast as near as  can figure
don't even have a clue what he did for a living as civilian
Reiben shakes his head
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian
They assembled him at
out of spare body parts from dead
's
know this for a fact
(defensively) You got somethin' against the Cap'n
Hell, no
think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none
They all nod in assent, no argument there
You got that right
Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation
Upham watches Miller, with even more curiosity
- Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a country cow path
They're staying close to the cover of the brush
Miller walks tall now
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable
If 'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle,  never would 'a volunteered for this here mission
You didn't volunteer, Jackson
most likely would have, sir, had been given the opportunity
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned
back to the beach for me
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft
Back home, we go out squirrel huntin',  walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister
You know what a
weighs
Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo
(re
ammo bandoleers) And you think these things are comfortable
They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there
So what
've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear
You don't hear me complaining
That's because, as  have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot
No,  just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things
How do you do it
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again
As  was saying, before  was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do
He needed someone to take care of him
We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home
Nice enough place but kind of depressing
But not for Granddad
He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service
It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck
Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died
You think he really believed it
Who knows
It worked
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes
You want unpleasant
Just wait, can do much better than this
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining
Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a shot
Well, as a matter of fact,  was just thinking
The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst
(continuing) That 'm so fucking tired of this goddamned walking, 'd pay a thousand dollars to see that bastard Ryan crawl on his belly over an acre of broken glass to hear my great-aunt Martha fart through a field-phone
The men are stunned
Jesus Christ, he's a natural
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat
Upham wiggles with pride
Upham Positive, sir, 'm certain 'd remember
Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men
He's good
They walk on
Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable
Miller smiles, situation normal
- small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield American soldiers crouch in doorways,  at well-placed Germans
Some French civilians dash across a street
man and a couple of women, one carrying a child
They make it across and disappear into the remains of a building
Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner
Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread out down the block behind him
Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental picture of a
's crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block
They are , about Miller's age, and
As Miller ducks back behind the corner, into the bricks where his head was an instant before
Miller motions Jackson across first
Stay low
Jackson gathers himself, takes off
, kicking up the cobblestone behind him
Jackson zig-zags and makes it to the cover of the far side
Dang
That was close
Miller nods to Upham
Your turn
Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move
Miller speaks to him very gently
Zig-zag, change your pace a couple times, you'll be alright
Upham's frozen
He can barely breathe
Miller sighs
Okay, 'm going to draw fire for you
(sternly) But if  do, you goddamned well better go
Upham nods
Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath
:  '  quivers
Looks to Upham Ready
Upham nods, still terrified
Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers
Go
Upham runs
He doesn't budge
very, very fast
watches Upham run
Hey, that guy can move
Miller's ear
gets to the far side
around the corner
Reiben and Wade don't even react to what Miller has just done
Sarge is pissed
He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent
(under his breath so only Miller can hear) Damn fool
(beat) Sir
Captain, he's fast
(glances at Sarge, speaks to Reiben) Glad of it
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson
Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him
across the street
, shattering the cobblestones, inches behind him
across
Calls back to Sarge
Bring 'em over
, tries to thank Miller
Captain,
Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade
One at a time
Ducks out of the doorway and crouch- runs down the block
He passes a: Out of the line of fire
dozen dead American soldiers lined up on the ground
The battered, bloody bodies, only partially covered by ponchos
Some badly wounded
's are being treated next to the dead
Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk
Sees the dead and wounded, shows no reaction
Runs to: Captain Hamill and his men are bunched there, out of the line of fire
He's sending off a squad to continue their door-to-door
Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the corners, one man close, one man wide
Be careful
Go
The squad takes off
Captain Hamill sees Miller
The two captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak familiarly
Captain hamill How was the road in
We had a jeep until a few hours ago, a nice one, it had a cute little flag with a couple of stars on it
Captain hamill Oh, what a shame
One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley
We called in a strike on the eighty- eights that took it out, but it's the Kraut spotter that counts, wherever the hell that bastard is
Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple
Captain hamill That's where your boy is
We've been trying to get him since this morning
He killed two of my men trying to get close enough for a shot
Miller eyes the distant steeple
Jackson
Jackson steps up
Miller points to the steeple
Jackson knows what he's supposed to do
He puts down his -1 and takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to his back
He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very unusual, long-barrel, rifle
Miller and his men give him some room
Hamill and his men, along with Upham, watch curiously
Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist, sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it
Then he takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it
He adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action
Upham is fascinated
What is that
Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized shell
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer
The Army gave you that
Yep
You must be a hell a shot
Not where  come from
Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and Evaluates
Calibrates the scope
He re-loads
Jackson
Evaluates
Perfect
He wipes the dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight and waits, absolutely motionless
That must be four thousand yards
(without taking his eye from the scope) Forty-two-hundred,  figure
You take account of the wind
Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you, some kind of fucking idiot
" Reiben puts himself between Upham and Jackson
(put-on Southern accent) Dang right, he take 'count of the wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a Kentucky windage
Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the trigger
Reiben, how many time  got to tell you, 'm from Tennessee
They got squirrels there, too, right
Jackson
Waits
tiny smile
He starts taking apart the rifle
very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his radioman
Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them the St
Mere road is open
The Radioman cranks up his radio
Captain Hamill turns to Miller
Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division
Very far, they're not coming this way, they're going to take Caen first
Captain Hamill Goddamn it,  was afraid of that
We're in a lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better
How many men did you bring
Five, but we not staying, we're on our way to Ramelle
Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private Ryan
Yeah, you know about that
Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead
Several of  ' , among them a - , prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan
Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted a German transmission after you left
The Krauts have two companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge, they'll be there sometime late tomorrow
Wonderful
Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the hell out of there before those Krauts show up
How do we get out of here
Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in real tight
After dark you try to slip out to the east
If you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens, you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by tomorrow night
Miller processes the information
Captain Hamill shakes his head
Captain hamill Tough, huh
Three brothers
Miller shrugs
Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but understand what you're doing
Yeah
Captain hamill Good luck
Thanks
Captain hamill  mean it
Find him
Get him home
Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful sincerity
Then he shakes it off and motions to his men
Let's find someplace to hole up
Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head of the alley, Miller passes Upham
Sir, 'm sorry about what happened, (interrupting) It was nothing
But you could have gotten killed and (interrupting) Like  said, it was nothing
(to the men) Don't bunch up
He takes off, crouch-running back down the block
Upham watches him go
Did you see what he did, back there
He stepped right into the open, so could get across
Shit, that was no big deal
They can't kill him
Like hell they can't
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing,  can't explain it, but 've seen it
We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing
The men are equal parts joking and admiring
Sarge is neither
No one's bulletproof
No one
(beat) 'mon, stay low
Sarge takes off after Miller
- Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins of a medieval church
Miller, settled into a comfortable spot in the debris, eating his -rations, looks very relaxed
Reiben paces
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me
Sure, what do you want to know
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one
What's the sense in risking six guys to save one
Ours is not to reason why
Huh
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine
'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir
It's a personal thing
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all
Easy for you to say, sir
(beat) Fucking James Ryan, 'd like to wring his fucking neck
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother
Hey,  got a mother
Jackson, you got a mother
Last  knew
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, 'll bet even the Captain has a mother
Miller smiles
Reiben eyes him and reconsiders
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers
You have orders, too
Sir,  have an opinion on this matter
'd love to hear it
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources
Miller Go on
Well, sir, by my way a thinkin'  am a finely made instrument of warfare
What  mean by that is, if you was to put me with this here sniper rifle anywhere up to and includin' one mile from Adolf Hitler, with a clear line of sight, war's over
Miller nods
Reiben,  want you to listen closely to Jackson
This is the way to gripe
Jackson, continue
Yes, sir
It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany
Now  ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent
Wade
Hell,  don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for
(finishing Wade's sentence) for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that
Upham
Pass
Sarge
'm just here to keep a bunch of numb-nuts, including one certain, frequently suicidal, tempter-of-fate, from getting themselves killed
Reiben eyes Miller
And what about you, Captain
Miller looks at Reiben, shocked
Reiben, what's the matter with you
don't gripe to you
'm a captain
There's a chain of command
Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down
You gripe to me,  gripe to my superior officers
Up, get it
don't gripe to you,  don't gripe in front of you
How long you been in the army
'm sorry, sir,  apologize
(beat) But if you weren't a captain, or if were a major, what would you say
Miller considers his response
In that case,  would say this is an excellent mission, with an extremely valuable objective, worthy of my best efforts
Reiben rolls his eyes
Miller plays it straight, with no obvious sarcasm
(continuing) In addition, as  pointed out earlier, have a fondness for cheese and hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation
Moreover,  feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and 'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering
The men thoroughly enjoy the performance
Sir, if you were not a captain, would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar
But  am a captain
If  were not a captain,  would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which  am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in
The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're about to find out Miller's home town
Miller smiles
(continuing) my home town, which shall remain un-named
The men ease back, disappointed
Any further thoughts on the subject
Yes, sir, as a final note, 'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan
'll make a note of your suggestions but 'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead
The men wince and laugh
Miller checks his watch and gets serious
We move out in two hours, try and get some sleep
The men know when to can it
Without another word, they all settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to follow Miller's order
Upham looks around at these strange men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow suit
Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his flashlight
He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light, he studies his maps while his men rest
-  () Dark
Reiben, Jackson, Wade and Upham sleep
Miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight, studying his maps
Sarge lies near him, awake, watching him
Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him
You ever going to open those letters
Miller keeps his eyes on the maps
Maybe
It's not normal, not reading letters from home
Since when have things been normal
You got me
Afraid of bad news
Nope
Good news
Miller looks at Sarge
moment passes between the two of them, then miller takes refuge in the maps
Sarge looks at the men
You think they'll be alright
They're fine
As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright
And what about you
Miller considers the question, doesn't answer
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up
Nope
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender
Three for three
If we stayed, we could make a difference
You're kidding yourself
You never know
They sit in silence for a moment
hope this boy Ryan is worth it
Now you're the one kidding yourself
(beat) Hell of  a mission
Yup, hell of a mission
Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men
Rise and shine, boys
Let's go
Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their gear
- through the village Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral toward the outskirts of town
They're just a small squad, but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are very formidable-looking
-  - Miller's men are getting ready to move out
Captain Hamill and a few of his men are there to see them off
Suddenly: Then
The sky is on fire
The over the countryside like a tidal wave
Then,
'
The is incredible, strange, other-worldly
Frozen in place
The lights play on their faces
looks down and sees his hand quivering
notices, says nothing
stares at his hand, forcing it to stop
Their eyes go back to the
(awe-struck) Makes you feel small, doesn't it
It doesn't take this
Upham's face shows more fear than awe
wasn't made for this
(bitterly) You think the rest of us were
Upham recoils
Miller instantly regrets his words
He turns to Upham and sees that he's really scared
Miller get a hold of himself and speaks gently
Don't worry, Upham, God'll protect you, this shit's gonna keep him up all night, anyway
Upham manages a slight smile
Miller watches the lights for a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off
Let's go, this ain't what they pay us for
Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it
He points the way
Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods
As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up with a couple bandoleers of
ammo
He offers them to Reiben
Gentle-faced private Here
Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart- ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's vulnerable expression stops the comment dead
Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at Guadalcanal
these might come in handy
Reiben takes the ammo
(gently) Just what  need
Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands them back to the Gentle-Faced Private
Thanks, but you may need these more than us, or Ryan
Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes the ammo back
Let's move out
Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness, lit intermittently by the distant flashes
Captain Hamill and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a strange bit of hope
- The   of the   fade away
The night is dark
The band of six Americans makes their way warily along a French cart path
Sarge eases up alongside Miller and speaks quietly to him
The others don't overhear
Sarge How long's your hand been shaking
couple of weeks
It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading
Is it getting worse
No
It comes and goes
It stops when  look at it
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore
'll be alright
Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk on
-  () Farther along
The men are tired but alert
Jackson is at point
Miller behind him
The others at intervals
Sarge brings up the rear
Jackson stops
No one speaks, they communicate only with hand signals
to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming
for the men to get off the path
They ease into the brush
An instant later, a appear
grips his
and looks to Miller for permission to open up
Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them go
"  moment later      rounds the bend
Fifty men
Heavily armed
breathes a sigh of relief and lowers hi
passes, their boots no more than two feet from the faces of the hidden Americans
Upham is wide-eyed with fear
The others are stone-faced
for his men to hold their positions
doesn't see the signal
He stands, breathing a sigh of relief, just as a  -  appears, trailing the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear
He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly exposed
Shitting bricks
Pissed,  prepares to fire
The Whip-tail squad approaches
Then, the  , miraculously, not seeing Upham in the shadows
They walk on and disappear
Upham is weak- kneed, amazed that he's still alive
shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the rest of the men to follow him into the woods
Upham scurries after Miller, staying close on his heels
- The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field, parallel to a cart path
Wary
Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each other
He   , getting their attention, and motions curtly for them to open it up a bit
They do so
- Dark
Miller checks the map as Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional signs
One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km
" Miller puts away the map
Checks the horizon
The first glow of dawn is visible
It'll be light, soon
Let's pick it up
- First light
The     has been replaced by the
The Americans are taking five
Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at the view
It's lovely
Dew shimmers on the long grass
The war is far away
Upham walks next to him
They look out at the view together without speaking for a moment
It looks like a Renoir
Yes
Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy
've been humming it
heard
It seemed appropriate
You know classical music
Some
Where are you from, Captain
Miller smiles
What's the pool up to
Upham smiles, caught
Over three-hundred
'll tell you what, if 'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, 'll let you know and we'll split the money
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand
don't expect to live that long
Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it
Five hundred, then
Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to feel an overwhelming wave of sadness
Then he turns himself back into a commander and barks at Upham
Let's go, private
Miller strides away
Upham watches him, trying to figure him out, then he simply follows him
- The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by war
Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable, hundred of years old
Miller sees
He motions to the men
They advance
Ext
french farm - day  burning house and barn
An old   kneels on the ground, weeping, next to this  , two adult women, an adult male and a boy, no more than ten
His animals, a pair of cows and a draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces
lies sprawled in the dirt with empty shell casings around his body
Miller and his men approach carefully
Miller motions to Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks gently to him in French
The    as if in a trance
Upham stands and translates
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg
The leg got infected
Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor
The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found
The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone
Did he see any sign of them
Upham gently asks
The
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss
Miller heads off without glancing back
The men hesitate
Sarge jerks his head for them to move out
They do so
Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others
- beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass
The last of the dew and morning mist is just burning off
The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the edge of the field
Miller notices something
He silently signals stop, crouches and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side
Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him
Jackson points to some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with bullets
Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush
Captain
Staying low, they join Wade who has found: trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field
, Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow
The others crawl up behind them
Where
In the shadow by those two trees
My guess, too
What is it
machine gun
Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover of the brush
He stands and takes off his pack
Sir, 've got an idea, let's go around
We can't leave it here
We left them eighty-eights
They don't send planes to put out machine guns
(beat) Two flank runners with surpressing fire
'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast
Upham steels himself and steps forward
Sir,  ran the 220 in high school
He's fast, Captain,  saw him
Miller takes Upham's measure
Wade laughs with a sneer
How fast
Twenty-four-five
Shit, that's nothing,  ran twenty- two flat
Wade goes left
Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear
Upham is impressed
Twenty-two flat
Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap
would have won the states if some bastard hadn't tripped me in the finals
Miller points the others to their firing positions
Sarge, Upham, here
Jackson, Reiben, ten yards, either side
As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly, out of earshot of the men
Rule of thumb, Captain, says you ought to detail this one, instead of going yourself
Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers
Yeah
What rule of thumb is that
How about  go right, sir
How about you take your position
Sarge hesitates
How about
(interrupting) How about you shut up and take your position
Sarge nods
Yes, sir
Sarge finds a spot
Miller joins Wade
Miller waits near Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions
Good luck, Captain
Don't need it, 'm a cat, 've got five lives
The men said, nine
What do they know
(beat) had nine, but  feel through the ice when  was seven, my brother pulled me out
Then  used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud
figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here
That only leaves three
Plenty
Miller sees that the men are in position
He nods to Wade
Ready
Yes, sir
Miller and Wade take deep breaths
Miller Now
Onto opposite sides of the field
Nothing happens for a moment
Then: squad of Germans, dug deep, , a 8MM, a stunningly powerful weapon
Four Germans in the nest, four more outlying riflemen
Takes the
He The   just over him
The   the back of his helmet
, , , Zero the machine gun
fast as they can
Their into the hedgerow
Bullets  into the ground all around Miller
from his Thompson
No effect
Pissed
in another
He rises and runs
Fast
Almost to the far hedgerow
Ten more yards
Too slow
deadly row of     toward him
Makes it to the far side
Scrambles up the roots
Dives through the brush
On a slight rise
Can't hit the dirt
line of bullets
Desperately sprints
He spins
Goes down
,     are horrified
at the nest
through the hedgerow
Stumbles onto the path
Rolls to his feet, running
Swings his Thompson into firing position
Racing toward the nest
at the nest
Tearing along the path
Sees a German rifleman Runs over the body without breaking stride
, from Miller
The
all around him
Somehow he's not hit
his Thompson
two more German riflemen
Grabs a grenade
Pulls the pin
The Germans see Miller coming
Wheel from Sarge
Too late
the grenade,  and
The four Germans in the nest are hollers to the others
Rolls to his feet
another the last of the German riflemen
Doesn't pause
onto the field
See Miller running toward Wade
They instantly  onto the field
Lies in the grass
Holding his belly
Astonished by the pain
Converging on Wade
Miller points, and yells, without slowing down
, ,
Stop instantly
Turn toward the perimeter of the field
Roots through his medical kit as he runs
Dropping and scattering inessentials behind him
Wide-eyed
Not even writhing
Too much pain
Throw themselves onto the ground next to him
They both tear out sulfa-packs
Sarge frantically fumbles
Ripping one open
Powder spills
repeatedly glance back at Wade
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound
Pours sulfa powder
About to pour his sulfa
Sees the wound
Stops
Knows it's fatal
Damn it
Throws the sulfa aside
Quickly pulls out a morphine pack
Fumbles with a second sulfa bag
Sulfa, more sulfa
Frozen in agony
Looks at Miller
Sees him preparing the morphine shot
They both know
Yeah
morphine
make it a double
huh
Captain
into Wade's neck
Thick vein
Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain
Motions impatiently to Sarge
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on
Hesitates
Then drops his sulfa
Fumbles in his pack
Finds the morphine
Snatches the morphine from Sarge
Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot
He's done this before
On guard, glancing back
Pissed off
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Freaked out
Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter
Can't
Watching
Gives Wade the second shot
Feels the effects of the first shot
He sees Upham and manages a pained smile
Looking at him without blame, without forgiveness
Drifts with the morphine
Then: begins to weep
: Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Is silent
Motionless
He gently closes Wade's eyes
His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags
He fumbles and drops it
Sarge notices
Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men see
He picks up the dogtag and pockets it
Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa, rises and picks up his Thompson
Upham shakes his head
That was no twenty-two flat
Miller     into his Thompson
He lied
Let's move out
Miller turns and walks away without looking back
The men hesitate, then slowly follow him
- narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel
The five
's walk, spread out
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch
Shut up, will you
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission  ever heard of
Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade
The hell he didn't
Miller motions to them curtly
Keep it down
They shut up
Miller falls in step to Sarge
Speaks quietly, the men don't hear
We've got to find someplace to hole up for a bit
Sarge looks at Miller closely
You alright
Let's just find someplace
- Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully
good hiding place
Rest
One hour
Jackson, Reiben, perimeter
Keep your eyes open
'm going to re-con
Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but there's something missing
It's subtle
Only Sarge notices
He watches Miller head off into the brush alone
- Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops
The life drains from him
He stands there, looking at the dirt, tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for faint, distant voices
His face shows a battle raging within, as he fights to keep from losing it entirely
Behind him, Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches
Miller senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a thousand miles away
Sarge sits down on a log and waits
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off
Vecchio
Yeah, Vecchio,  couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze
Yeah
You know why 'm such a good officer
Because of my mother
Have  ever told you about her
Bits and pieces
She's the best poker player you ever saw
My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt
Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night
He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost
She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands
And he bluffs
He had sixteen levels of bullshit
Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master
She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game
Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some
And 'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time  was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it
(beat) That's why 'm such a good officer, can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand,  know just what cards to deal him
And what about your own hand
No problem
pair of deuces
Less
So what
bluff
It used to tear me apart when 'd get one of my men killed, but what was  supposed to do
Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do
Of course not, so  bluffed, and after a while, started to fall for my own bluff
It was great, it made everything so much easier
Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking
It could be worse
You know the first thing they teach you at
Lie to your men
Oh, yeah
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn
So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men
Of course not
You bluff, you lie
And how do you bluff yourself
Simple, numbers
Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others
We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs
'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns
That's over three hundred men
Maybe five hundred
thousand
Then thousand
Any number you want
See
It's simple
It lets you always choose mission over men
Except this time, the mission  a man
That's the rub
liked Wade
Who's Ryan
If they're both standing in front of me and  have to shoot one or the other, how do  choose
Look at my hand, there it goes again
John, 've got to tell you,  think you're about used up
think you're right, Keith
You want me to take over
The question helps Miller pull himself back together
He looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again
No, but if  get any worse, you'll have to relieve me
(sighs) Just what  want to do
They share a smile
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive
know
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then  won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore
'll do my best
They shake their heads at the madness of it all
Miller Hell of a
() Ah, forget it
Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting himself
He's about ninety-five percent there
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me
You're welcome, John
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity,  feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted
Sarge allows himself a slight smile
Yes, sir
Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow
They head back to the men
- The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade
No talk
Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing
Miller barks at the men
Up
We're moving out
thought you said we had an hour, sir
Well now 'm saying we're moving out
Get off your ass
The men get up
Jackson is a bit slow
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson
Sir,  ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade
Who's Wade
No one responds
said, who the hell is Wade
The men exchange looks
Jackson speaks for them
Sir,  understand what you're doin', but  respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner
You'll grieve the way  tell you to goddamned grieve
There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand
Sir,  understand
don't like it, but  understand
Good, now get your goddamned gear
The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out
Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look
Miller shakes his head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit to work
He knows they have no choice
- Miller and his men walk along the road
The men are silent, grim
- Miller checks his map
figures out where they are
Folds up the map, points the way and they move out
- More progress
The men are still grim
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live
Miller laughs
Miller 'll bite, Reiben
've given this a lot of thought, sir
The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead
Why's that
Well, sir, consider the possibilities
:  Ryan is alive
We have to take him back to the beach
Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive
Except for the last part, that one's not bad
:  Ryan is dead
He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name  know you don't want me to mention
There's nothing to find
The biggest piece is the size of a pea
We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another
don't like that one
Neither do , sir
:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded
Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear
And him
But we accomplish the mission
Maybe
But what if he dies on the way back
you see what 'm saying, sir
The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material
No, sir
That's a mystery to me
No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less
- The
Miller checks a map in the brush near the crossroads
sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km
"  Miller folds up the map
Looks like we're going to beat those Kraut companies to Ramelle
Suddenly Miller stops dead
He listens, hearing something the others don't hear
He motions for them to freeze, they do
The  grows louder
It's an
don't think so
- turns into the
Troop trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack Wehrmacht troops
Heavily armed
Imposing
Crossing a bridge
Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge
Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert
Hurry along the fields on either side of the road, trying to keep up with the vehicles Catch a glimpse of an approaching German Flank Squad
They flatten themselves into the mucky water
Ready their weapons
Prepare to fire
Approaches the bridge
See the culvert obscured by brush
Move to check it out
Is just about to open up on them
Sees his Flank Squad lagging behind and  to them
Obey
Hurry after the rest of the convoy
The Americans breathe again
wonder where they're going
Same place we are
Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast is clear
They head out
- gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small, cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone walls
The twos is visible beyond
Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the stone walls
Miller pulls out his binoculars
There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles
Scans the Germans with his binoculars
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits
sure hope so
What do you think they're waiting for, Captain
Just then they hear an  , deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy
The sound gets and
Miller and his men exchange looks
They know that sound, they don't like it
Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who greet them enthusiastically
The tanks are tigers, huge, far bigger than an American Sherman
Each one, sixty-two tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and impregnable armor
Each one, an infantryman's nightmare
There are four of them
Puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow, low, along the wall
The men are happy to do so, looking back nervously at the German tanks
-  - The
The town square is a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell casings and bodies, German and American and a few French civilians
Miller and his men enter the square, weapons ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway
Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging debris
They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of the firing
Sarge motions his guess
Miller nods in agreement
He signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the firing
They move on, dashing from cover to cover
-  - dozen   on the bridge exchange with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near the bridgehead
The bridge has clearly been the scene of heavy fighting
Craters, burning debris and shell casings are everywhere
The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged
There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on both sides of the bridge
Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain
'
calls back
,
' '38 -
Miller turns to his men
They all come up empty
(to his men) Cover me
What if our guys open up, sir
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules
Have it your way, Captain
Miller takes a breath, then  out into the open, toward the bridge
Bullets     around Miller
' at the German positions, The Paratroopers pour a at the German positions
Miller makes it to the bridge and  over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies
He finds himself next to    who was the young but grizzled voice that called out
With Forrest are some very worn-out, young
Miller catches his breath
Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to nineteen
They won on a field goal in overtime
'll keep it in mind
(calls to Sarge) , ,
Miller and the paratroopers   for Miller's men as they come in
Miller and Forrest alternately take and
Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days
Things are tough all over
We're looking for a Private James Ryan
Forrest Ryan
Is he here
Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers
Forrest Go get Ryan
( ) What do you want him for, sir
Miller doesn't answer
Jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them
Jackson, get a hold of command
Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five
Miller turns to Forrest
How many men do you have
They pause to , covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men to leap over the barricade
Forrest Eleven, sir
We started with thirty-six
The bridge was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us ever since
They must want it intact or we'd be long gone
Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's hailing
No response
Not yet
Keep trying
Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan
Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees: Dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them
Ryan is an American classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky
Though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive
His eyes shine, his face has a spark
You can't help but love this kid
' All watch Ryan run toward them
So, that's Ryan
Looks like a flaming asshole to me
Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the barricade
He salutes Miller
'm Ryan, sir
You wanted to see me
Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally face-to-face with him
Ryan waits
Miller hesitates, searching for words
Then he speaks gently but clearly
Miller Private, 've got some bad news for you
Your brothers have been killed in action
The life instantly drains from Ryan
His breath comes hard
Somehow he remains upright
Ryan All three
Yes
Ryan sways
Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning him against some sandbags
Are stunned at the news
They look at Ryan, there's nothing else they can do
' Also look at Ryan, but then, one after another, they turn away, adverting their eyes, looking a their own boots, the debris on the bridge, the sky, anything other than Ryan
We've been sent to get you out of here
You're going home
Ryan weakly waves Miller off
Miller motions to his men and the paratroopers to move away
They do so, giving Ryan a little room
Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch
Sergeant, we're moving out and 'm taking you and your men with me
Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty- ninth Division
'm giving you new orders, Sergeant
Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command
'm not going to leave you and your men here to get killed
Get them together, we're moving out
from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly
(
) No, sir
They all turn and see Ryan standing there
Miller is about to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him
Come on, Private, you're going home
Ryan jerks away from Miller
No, sir
All eyes are on Miller and Ryan
Miller remains patient
Private
'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks
This bridge cannot be held
The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here
They have tanks
That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers, but Ryan holds his ground
Ryan Sir, 'm still not going
Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger
Private, if you want to commit suicide, that's your choice, but you're going to have to wait until after  get you back to the beach
And you're not going to take these men with you
Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller
'm not leaving, sir
Miller starts to boil over
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if  have to drag you every inch of the way
You hear me, Private
hear you sir, but 'm not leaving
Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him
Ryan doesn't resist
Listen you little son-of-a-bitch you're coming with me or 'll
'll
Ryan speaks softly
What are you going to do, sir, shoot me
Miller considers it
Then    from behind Miller
(politely) Uh, excuse me, Captain
Miller slowly turns and glares
(continuing) So, what are a few tanks, sir
Miller's more amazed than pissed off
Reiben smiles
(continuing) He's right, we can't shoot him
well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble
And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is
Cap'n
Miller turns his glare on Jackson
(continuing) Seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone
Command seems to think keepin' this boy alive is worth somethin'
If we was to do that and hold this bridge, good chance we'd get us a bucket full of medals
might even get me one 'a them big, fancy ones like you got, so's  could sass any officer in the whole dang army, you included
Miller does a slow burn
'd like to stay, too, Captain
You don't count
do and personally, 'd rather get the hell out of here, but somebody's got to stay and take care of you and these pin-head privates of yours
Miller looks at
Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir
Reiben smiles
See, Captain
The vote's unanimous
Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head
Miller The vote
What the hell are you talking about
We don't vote
This isn't a democracy
This is the army,  give orders, you follow them
We don't vote
Yes, sir, of course, sir,  was merely speaking hypothetically
this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous
But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir
You're goddamned right,  give the order
Vote
Jesus Christ
Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit,  am the ranking officer here and what  say goes, is that clear
They all quickly nod
Yes, sir
Of course, sir
All the others Yes, sir
Yes, sir
Miller looks from face to face
In that case
(beat) vote we stay
That's what they wanted to hear
Miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders
Reiben, the
, there
Jackson, get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle
Sarge, you and Upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is
Forrest, want a full inventory of all your weapons, ammo and ordnance
Go
They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller for a moment
Thank you, sir
(gruffly gentle) Yeah, yeah
want you right next to me, no matter where  go, you understand
Ryan salutes
Yes, sir
Alright, come with me
Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side
- Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory
Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six -1's, eight Tommy guns and about sixty rounds per man
That's it
Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry
Sir, can  change my vote
Miller sighs, worried
'  - Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a crescent of sandbags
His eye is at his scope
He
Falls from a window on the edge of town, dead
Sits beside Jackson with a pair of binoculars, searching for another target
The German sniper fire has subsided for now
Ext
bridge - day Miller watches as Ryan and several other paratroopers dig a series of trenches across the street, leading to the bridge
Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan
Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head
He speaks to Sarge who holds several satchel charges
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable
Yes, sir
Just then they hear the sound of They all turn at the sound
Eighty-eights, right
Miller nods
can tell what the gunners had for dinner
Those guns are close
Forrest Just south of town
The Krauts have a two gun emplacement, we saw it on the way in
That's how we knew they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out of us
Let's hope they don't change their mind
Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest
- Within sight of the bridge
Sarge carefully plants a wire- triggered satchel charge at the door of the building
He sets the wire, then carefully backs away
- Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine gun nest
Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham at his side
What do you think
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks
What are we going to do
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else
Maybe Caen
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here
What about our grenades
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades
Would they notice and eighty-eight
Sure, you got one
The Germans do
Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles
Upham, go find Jackson, he and  are going hunting
Upham runs off
Sarge shakes his head
Uh, oh
Out of the mouth of babes
- Dark
Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with blackening soot
The rest of Miller's men and several paratroopers, including Ryan, look on
Upham is distressed
Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping
You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice
But, sir
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay
Goddamn it, sir
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go
Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers
Leave him to me, Captain, 'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us
See to it
Steps up to Miller
'd like to go, sir
No, private,  want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid
Aren't they the same thing, sir
Miller smiles
Reiben,  don't know what 'd do without you
Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive
Yes, sir
Miller checks Jackson and Forrest
You ready
Forrest Yes, sir
You betcha, sir
Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out
(southern accent) 'all come back
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way  talk
(heavy southern accent) Hell, no
Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest into the darkness
Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go
-  - German eighty-eight , sending its big shell into the night
It's eight-man crew re-loads
slight movement
It's Miller
He crawls to the edge of the emplacement and freezes in the shadows
moment later he's joined by Forrest
moment after that, Jackson silently crawls up to them
Eyes the emplacement
Looks for a weakness
There is none
He motions to Forrest and Jackson to wait
The three of them settle into the darkness
-  - Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness
Ryan is lost in thought, far away
One after another, Miller's men eye him
Private, 'm sorry about your brothers
Ryan nods
Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip from Iowa back to France
He turns to Sarge
Ryan What was the name of the guy who got killed coming up here
Wade
Wade
Huh, he died coming up here to keep me alive
never met him
he didn't know me from Adam, strange
What was he like
good man, kind of cheerful, Reiben, here, used to call him a happy idiot
Like hell,  did
My brothers would be mighty pissed off at me, if they knew  let some guy get killed trying to keep me alive
You didn't let anybody get killed, you didn't even know we were coming up here
Sure,  know, but
(sighs) Goddamn it all
The others nod in agreement
They look closely at Ryan
-  - Dark
No firing
Two German soldiers on watch
It's Miller
Easing through the darkness
Closer to one of the sentries
Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry
Miller nods to Jackson
They move at the same moment
Behind the sentries
- Forrest removes the wheel-blocks
Approaches
He sees Forrest
Just as he's about to open up with his sub-machine gun, Miller grabs him from behind,  him, eases the body silently to the ground
Join Forrest at the eighty-eight
Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the German's truck
Rounds a corner
Sees them -
Forrest ,
Race over,
Covering them,
Kills the advancing Germans
frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck
, several more Germans
Spins
Still
Giving Miller cover
into the cab of the truck
into the back
into the approaching Germans
Is shattered by bullets
Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands
In the back of the truck
Spraying the Germans with his Thompson
The truck  through the Germans
The Germans  at the truck and trailing eighty-eight
,    Drive into the night
The Germans  after them
- Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a gauntlet of Germans
As they approach the bridge, the other American's   for them
Miller drives the truck onto the bridge
, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge
Ryan ignores him
They get the eighty-eight safely behind the barricade
Miller grabs Ryan
Sorry, sir
Miller fumes
he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging, clearly not pissed at Ryan
Don't do that again
won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so
Miller
Yes, sir
Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off
- Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine
Very gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines
- Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt
They cover it and step back carefully
Then they proceed with the next
Upham is covering their tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll place the rest of the mines
- Quiet
Dark
Everything is ready
There's nothing to do now but wait
Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags
They can see Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning the rear machine gun nest with Sarge
What do you think
think 'm we got that eighty-eight
mean, Ryan, what do you think of him
Jackson shrugs
He ain't half-bad,  guess
guess
They're quiet for a moment
He ain't Wade
Nope, he ain't Wade
Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan
Crouch-runs through the shadows and stops at the bridgekeepers hut
Reiben
Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun nest
Yes, sir
jumps down and moves forward
runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in the rear machine gun nest
You set
Sarge nods
Yes, sir
Miller and Sarge exchange a look
Then Miller slips off to check the others
- First light
The Americans are ready for battle them in their positions: Manning the forward machine gun nest
Behind the sandbags, on top of the bridgekeeper's hut
Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward and the rear machine gun nests
Manning rear machine gun
At the bridgehead, waiting
All eyes turn
Dashes across the street
Exposed only for an instant
Then another
And another
Cocks his Thompson
Settles down behind some sandbags
,
with the
At least fifty of them, advancing on the bridge
Running from cover to cover
squad pushing a French truck, using it as a shield
Calmly picking off the attacking Germans
Make their way down the streets
Along the riverbank
Through the houses
There are from all directions
Sees Reiben and Upham being cut off
Grabs the
, stands and fires
Running out of ammo
See that there's nothing else they can do
Time to go
Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber
Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes
They run as fast as they can
takes a glancing slug
Falls
Rolls and gets up
Bleeding from the side, but not mortal
Upham helps him
They      of the first barricade
The Germans are almost on them
With the rear
Drops several Germans
They swarm over the first barricade
into a German's belly
another with the stock of his Thompson
--
for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks
Two of the Germans    among the paratroopers see the grenades
Too late
No time to react
-- Half a dozen Germans break through
Miller
Is jumped on by one
Upham
the German
Struggling with a pair of Germans
Drops one of the Germans on Miller with a head shot
Cuts open Miller's face with bits of skull
Leaps onto the final German attacking Miller
That German raises his rifle on Ryan
All see it
the German
About to kill Ryan
Torn apart by bullets from three directions
got him
Like hell you did,  got him
He got him
in a fresh clip
an arc
four Germans
Sees an oncoming
to Reiben and Upham: '
They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make it to the barricade
Sees them in deep trouble
Leaves Ryan firing the rear machine gun
Grabs the
, Exposed
, ,  make it to the barricade
Dive over
Sees they've made it Races for cover
trail of bullets right behind him
for all they're worth
Trying to cover Sarge
Too many Germans
continue to fire, horrified
Cradling the
Stumbling toward cover
Slowing
Bleeding
Desperately trying to cover him
Open up with a volley
Is almost there
As best they can
Right past Sarge
It's not enough
Five feet from the sandbags, his back is   by Germans fire
He looks down, stunned at his chest
Amazed to see
An instant of surprise, more than fear
He looks to Miller
Takes two more stumbling steps
Falls onto the sandbags
Dropping the
over the edge
Dies
, Who killed Sarge are killed
The others back off for now
, , ,  fire at the retreating Germans
Grabs Sarge and pulls him over the barricade
Sees that he's dead
Around the corner
Stunned, lays Sarge down, kneeling next to him
Watch, start to gather
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Goddamn it
Get back to your positions
They hesitate
Go
They follow the order
All except Ryan, who doesn't move
He can't take his eyes off Sarge
Doesn't move
He just stares at Sarge's body
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway
He gently tries to move Miller aside
'll take care of Sarge
Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body
Miller grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over Wade's body
Sarge
Who's Sarge
But this time it doesn't work
He can't make it stick
The hard expression, disappears
He drifts, utterly lost
He's called his own bluff
- Dark
Quiet
The distant guns are silent for once
Waiting
Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have tightened their perimeter
Miller is in a trance
The others glance at him nervously
They eat in silence
-rations
Some bread
last supper
Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks: English teacher, Addley, Pennsylvania
Slowly, Miller's men turn to him
What'd you say, Captain
teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania
Well, 'll be goddamned,  knew it
Like hell, you did
Captain, what about our deal
changed my mind
What deal
coach the baseball team, too
No kiddin'
What deal
Forget it
They all sit in silence
You know that cruise ship Wade's grandfather was on
They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's talking about
(continuing) wonder if his cabin is still available
That's not where  am
Miller No
Where are you
'm in a dressing room with Mrs
Rachel Troubowitz, our super's wife
She's an easy forty-four, double , but 've convinced her she's a thirty- eight  and 'm watching her try and squeeze herself into a side-stay, silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle with s Helf-lift brassiere
(smiles) She's having a devil of a time, getting into that thing
They all share Reiben's dream for a moment
Then Jackson smiles
Me
'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon
got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey
Jackson, how many times  got to tell you, you're from Tennessee
am, but  like imported whiskey
So there  am and  hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me
That ole' boy comes right out of the brush,  got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker
aim,  got my finger tight on the trigger and then  just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here
Then  sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey
Upham smiles
don't know,  kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship
've never been to Tahiti
What about you, Captain
Miller smiles
He knows exactly where he is
'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass
Say what, Cap'n
You see, 've got the best house in all of Addley
It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field
The garage windows face left field
The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen put over them
The first thing did when  bought the place was take off those screens
Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows
It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship
lay there in my hammock and every time  hear the sound of breaking glass,  know we're one step closer to winning it all
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n
It's worth it
To each, his own
They're all silent for a moment
Then Miller turns to Ryan
How about you, James
Ryan sighs
'm home, playing basketball with my brothers, it's evenin' time, we're trying' to get in a few more points before it's too dark to see the ball
That's where  am
They all nod
Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on
They all eat in silence
- First light
Lovely
Dew shimmers
ground fog drifts
Louder
And louder toward the village

Sees: Here they come

More Germans drop
Lots of them
Moving from cover to cover
Manning the forward machine gun
Way out front
Sees that he's going to be cut off
He grabs the hot gun
The barrel burns into his flesh
He ignores the pain and toward the bridge

More Germans drop

They start working their way to the tops of the nearby buildings
Making their way along the riverbanks
Forward
Reiben
Ryan feeding the ammo belt
Hears that
Doesn't hesitate
He grabs a pair of ammo boxes toward Reiben and Ryan
on him
He's outrunning them
Almost there
--
Torn apart
Stumbles the final few steps to the machine gun nest
Falls on the sandbags, giving Reiben and Ryan the ammo
'
For just a micro-second
No time
Grabs the ammo Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the one almost out
Continues
the advancing Germans
Knows what that means
He hears the Immediately grab the machine gun and ammo and race back to the rear nest
Then    converge at the eighty-eight Huge
Terrifying
Clanking
Trailed by two German infantry platoons
On the bridgekeeper's hut
Picking off German soldiers who follow the tank
Hollers into the tanks voice-tube
Stops
Grinds its gears
Turning it's turret towards the bridgekeepers hut
Knows what's coming but he holds his position, continuing to pick off German soldiers
' bare moment to react
Then, they turn their attention back to the eighty-eight
Frantically turning the aiming cranks
Lowering the barrel to point blank
-
Which can fire first
Win the race
- Quickly reload the eighty-eight
Shoves the   into the breech of the eighty-eight
Pats Ryan on the back
Grabs a
down the bridge
Right toward the two advancing tanks
-
Races through the debris
Trailed by
With the machine gun
Covers Miller
Keeping most of the German infantry down
jumps behind the second machine gun
Opens up
Helping to cover Miller
Turret spins
Turning toward the fast approaching Miller
Ready to blow him to bits
Is almost there
He arms the satchel charge
'
Throws the satchel charge under the tank
Rolls off the edge of the bridge
Lands on the embankment below
, ,  continue
Almost out of ammo
, back onto the bridge, hears something over the
Ryan and Reiben cease firing
Now they hear it, too
,     than any they've heard yet
Goddamn it
More tanks
Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation
They know that they are dead men
They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die
They wait
The
'
a hint
of a smile
then a real smile
from over the rise
Then , Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers
They keep coming and coming
American tanks, with wave after wave of
infantrymen, looking for targets
They find a few among the departing Germans
Run onto the bridge and start to secure the position
and a few of   look around, curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and Ryan, battered and bloody, standing among the bodies
strides up
Major Report, Captain
Miller, Company , Second Rangers, that's Private Richard Reiben and that's Private James Ryan, Hundred- and-First Airborne
The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear
Ryan
One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another
Soldier That's him, that's Ryan
The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder
Major Command is looking for you, son
You're going home
Ryan looks up, tired
He nods
- American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the road and over the bridge
, Watch
In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered
Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by any of the advancing troops or vehicles
Walks to the bodies
He kneels down next to Sarge and looks at him for a long moment
Then, with a steady hand, he takes one of Sarge's two dog-tags
Then he does the same to Jackson and Upham
watch silently
Stands and walks back to Reiben and Ryan
He hands the dog-tags to Ryan who grips them tightly and nods in thanks
Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then he shoulders his gear
Miller Let's move out
Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear
They walk with Miller down the road, away from the bridge
The three dirty, bloodied, tired men walk down the road, ignored by the fresh troops marching in the opposite direction
Captain
Yes, Private
Upham and Jackson, what were they like
Upham
Good kid, smart, he was writing a book
Yeah
Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the 220 in twenty-four-five
No kidding
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson
And Sarge
Sarge
(beat) He was the best friend  ever had
(smiles) Lemme tell you about Sarge
They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the road and over the bridge
Fade out
