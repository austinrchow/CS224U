( 18) Screenplay by Bruce Feirstein (for educational purposes only) -------------------------------------------------------------- : -   - Super:   , We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known World
"  landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding
In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine
Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging over a cliff: 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid
Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up the ice
human figure
This is: ,    , 007
Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air
He has an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots
black backpack
As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to into the ice, but - 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off,  onto the rocks below
Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death
He looks up: So very, very, far to go
Bond shakes his head: There has to be an easier way to earn a living
Still, Bond climbs
Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until - - He's 25 feet from the top
He drives a first ice pick in
Gets a toehold
But when he slams the second pick in - ,
- - And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall
Bond pauses
Thinks
And coolly begins to swing himself back and forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum
At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice -
He looks up at: ,      - Beginning to work its way out
The tether, fraying
- Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time
Once
Twice
And on the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but
,      - Now jutting downward, barely holding
The tether is almost totally frayed through
- One last chance
Bond swings
Once
Twice
He reaches back, hurls himself at the wall, lunging - Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one
Still, he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward
- Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge
He drives a pick down - through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed
As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and - - Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below
- torrent of water crashes over 007
Fighting the oncoming deluge, he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland
- (    , ) Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed
He looks back at the cliff: '  -    - On either side of the water, there are two small  , angled down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself
In other words: This was the only way in
- 007 shrugs
From his backpack, he takes out  - , and an
He presses a button on the side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap -   unfold
He presses buttons on the canisters:
Bond slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow
-  -      - - Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below, amidst boulders
In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down
- Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection
At the bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to: Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack
He unpacks (and unfolds) a

Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy
' - 'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister
But this is, still, a naval operation
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin
(asks questions in flawless Russian) The general chuckles
Translates: 'In a joint operation, someone's nose always gets put out of joint
' turns to Admiral Roebuck: 'm interested in success, Admiral
Not who gets credit
(turning to:) Mr
Tanner: What have we got
Tanner points to the video wall with a
(ironically) regular terrorist swap meet
Death at discount: Two Chinese Long March Scuds, a pair of Soviet -17 attack helicopters - (interrupting) Stolen - And the crates look like American -16 assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel mines, six French Exocet missiles, and 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of Czech made -4 Semtech explosive

(pushes a button on a console) One to seven: Deal the face cards
- Bond adjusts a knob on the scope
-6   - On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a   of one of the arms traders
Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen
Gustav Meinholtz
Neo-Nazi, former East German  agent
Ties to the Beider-Meinhoff gang
(pressing a button) Aces high, seven
Bid to the east
Bond shifts his aim, east
(Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on another face, and the man's stats appear in London
Vilko Barkoviac
Bosnian war criminal; thought to be operating freelance out of Teheran

Bid to the North
Bond complies
Another face, another set of stats: Sitoshi Isagura
Japanese religious fanatic
Wanted for the Tokyo subway - (impatiently, cutting him off:) 've seen enough
Let's finish this

Tanner hits a button - and a third video screen appears, displaying a satellite view of the area, detailing the Cruise's path and progress
One to seven: Exit target area
Repeat - ' Seven to one

The forklift reaches the back of the truck
as the fork begins rising to unload something
And as the man turns,   to scan the area: Oh, no
Who is it

North Korean Nuclear specialist
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there

Without breaking stride, he swings his gun to the right:
Still running, he swings to the left:

Rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa
Bond is in bed with a smart, , (and, yes, stunning,) 30-ish Chinese woman,
(: The Chinese here is Mandarin, spelled phonetically
) (running a finger across her lips) And what do you call these
Ja-shwa tsway
These are lips
Indeed they are
(kisses them, lightly) Deadly little things
She laughs
His hand goes beneath the sheets
And what do you call these
The Gang of Two
(smacking his hand, laughing:) Stop it
was just getting to the interesting part
We've already done the interesting part
Do you forget
Remind me
He moves to roll on top of her, but she pushes him off, teasing: Sakwa
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese
Mandarin
You jerk
(tousling his hair) 'm late
have to get dressed
She hops off the bed, leaving frame
Bond settles back on the headboard, ready to enjoy the view
When his
(lightly) Hello - (catching himself) Hello
'  - -6
, at her desk
Hello, James
hope 'm interrupting something important
- (  ) (Jenny has a leg on the bed, pulling on a full Victoria's Secret outfit: Nylons, garter/suspenders, bustier, etc
) Not at all, Moneypenny
was just brushing up on a little Chinese
(In the background, Jenny insists " am not little
") 'm sure she is, James
But 'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon
(mock chagrin) Moneypenny
Here  was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue - Four o'clock
will meet you in the conference room
Bond watches with amusement as Jenny Wu slips a Graduation-type gown over the lingerie
No dress
4:30
It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here
Four o'clock
Don't be late
(hanging up:) Tsi tien, Chien-penny
: Ah, James
You always were a cunning linguist
Au revoir, mon cher
Moneypenny hangs up, looks up, and blanches:  is standing there
Don't ask
Don't tell
(walking away) don't want to know
-  '  -  - Bond and Jenny Wu emerge from the office
(She's still in the gown
) They pass a flock of young students: Good afternoon, Professor Wu
Good afternoon
(then to Bond) Are you sure you can't stay for the lecture
can't
But  did enjoy the dress rehearsal
She gives him a wry glance, opens a door to a lecture hall
Tsi tien, Mr
Bond
Tsi tien, Professor Wu
She exits; Bond walks off, passing underneath a
- The  Globe Logo - The Harmsway News Network - spins into view, followed by: You're watching , the Harmsway 24 hour news network
Coming up: (mortise shot of:) Valentin Zukofsky's stunning victory in the Ukrainian Presidential elections
(mortise shot of:) Live coverage of the latest communications satellite launch from Xichang (shi-chung) China
And - (mortise shot of:) special report on the situation in Hong Kong, since the Chinese take- over from Great Britain
-6  - The -5 drives past the guard
- Debriefing: Bond, , and several others listen as , (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from the Khyber Pass sequence: To sum up: After analyzing the tire inflation of the fork-lift in the -6 video tape,  believes the "red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of U235 weapons grade uranium - an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal substance
And that's enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices
Depending on the builder's sophistication - one crude bomb that could devastate London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all four if they have the latest technology
There's a pregnant pause in the room
And the participants
(pointing at the screen) Kim Dae Yung
Moscow-trained North Korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell out of favor with the current North Korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a British light-water reactor in South Africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless
Another face appears on the screen: (cont'd) And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as Richard Stamper
Freelance mercenary, Laos and Cambodia
His father was from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con- scripted by the British government to fight in China during World War  - after which the family settled in Hong Kong, where the young Stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the Hong Kong Chinese, and local British
(beat, aside:) We've all read about the signs at the British swimming pools in Hong Kong that said "No Ghurka's allowed
" Nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful
(stifles a smile, then:) In conclusion: Both these men have a vendetta against the world
They are nuclear armed, and dangerous
And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route - the Khyber Pass - it's 's belief that their next attempt will be through Bulgaria - where the  Nuclear Strike Force will be there to stop them
Thank you Colonel Everhart
(stands, turns to:) 007, 'd like to see you in my office
Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information
Yes,
exits
Bond approaches Dominique
She smiles, warmly
There's a mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken
Interesting presentation
Interesting video tape
They point,  shoot
(feels her pockets) Do you have a pen
just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet
Of course
Bond hands her a
She regards it cautiously
Does this do anything
Depends what number you write
She gives him a wry look; starts to write
He notes her
Married
Happily
Kids
Three
You
Married
No
(smiles) didn't think so
For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness
Re- morse
Either way, she's scored a subtle victory
Here
gave you my assistant's phone number
If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me
Thanks
(beat, holding her gaze) Take care - You too
With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave
- Where Bond encounters , also walking to 's office
Moneypenny
We've got to stop meeting like this
They may be on to us
Hello, James
Enjoy your meeting
In the darkest moments, it's what live for
Especially since 've heard how much you like to watch
On the hidden camera
Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them
By the way, James: Ordinarily  would never ask, but
Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea
Moneypenny
How indiscreet
Have you ever known me to kiss and tell
They've come to a security door
She punches in a code - Actually, 've never known you to do either
But - - We all want what we can't have
Not all of us, 007
The door opens
They go into: '  (' ) - What - no lust for adventure
No, 007
It's just that 've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - (beat) Somehow the reality is never as
Satisfying as the fantasy
Bond scowls
Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door: Don't keep  waiting
'  - is behind her desk;    sits across - a high- handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of plutonium
They've been arguing
Come in, 007
You know the Minister
Of course
(nods to) Minister Johnstone
007
Bond sits in an armchair
presses a button, and a video/bio of appears on the wall behind her
Mid-50's, regal
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway
(quipping) Only what  read in the newspapers
(disdainfully) His newspapers
(glancing sideways) Occasionally, yes
(directly to ) British media mogul
Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, , radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software
Theme parks
(holding up a copy of:) - Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper
Circulation 27 million
Daily
- 'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press
(hurrumph) Exactly
Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically
Then a very tight-lipped
He senses he's about to enter a minefield: What's Harmsway done
It seems, 007, we've received a tip rumor - from an anonymous source - - that Sir Elliot may be involved with Stamper and Yung, and the missing Uranium
Hearsay
Idle chatter from a source you can't identify - who insists on talking only to 007
Nothing but loose talk and innuendo
That may be the case at present, Minister Johnstone
But our own sources suspect that Mr
Harmsway used his considerable Russian media - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky President of the Ukraine - in trade for the uranium
( has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared
) More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip
Perhaps
But it does explain how an ex- agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people
(beat) If you believe what you read in the papers
(annoyed) Need  remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen
That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor
(long pause, then:) No more than  need remind you, Minister, that merely being a member of the lucky sperm club - does not preclude one from a life of criminal activity
Johnstone is reeling
continues, to Bond, with aplomb: The reason  invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion
Of course
Which is also why 've withheld this information from  and our allies
(nods, then, recalling) Didn't we once investigate Harmsway
Yes
1988
He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government
The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn -6 a rather powerful enemy - Not to mention the chaos it caused at Whitehall when his newspapers began screaming for the recall of the sitting government
(a beat, then:) 'm sending you to Venice, 007
You're to check out the source, determine whether Elliot Harmsway is involved with the enriched uranium, and, if so, stop him
How will  meet the informant
She hands Bond a  : You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted
understand
(standing, to leave) There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation
He's also a major contributor to the party expect him to be given every consideration
Political considerations
To the best of my recollection, Mr
Bond,  suggested no such thing
(beat, at the door) In fact,  was never here
And he exits
, frowning, hits a button on her intercom: Would you send in the new man from equipment branch
(
) Right away
hate to ask, but
Did you ever think you'd miss Communism
We serve the interests of the British people, 007
No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect
Bond is silent, chastised
looks away, then looks back: But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium,  want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth
Hopefully, it won't get that far
looks up:  , 's successor, limps in, looking like a mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch
Come in, Saunders
007
Okay, Saunders
What is it this time
Rocket in the leg
Machine pistol in the arm
's retirement party
'd just put the knife into the cake, and - Come on
know better than that - Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg
Saunders
It must do something
Well
If you insist
Saunders flexes his broken arm;   pop out of the it
The die is cast
Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with
He takes off the cast and neck-brace, and places a  on 's desk
Now pay attention, 007
We haven't much time to demonstrate your new  toys
How is old
Gone fishing
Fishing
Big game fishing
(beat) Sonar torpedoes
Retirement gift from his friends at the
Saunders has opened the briefcase
Bond tries to look inside, but Saunders repositions it
Saunders continues: In the meantime, perhaps this will spark your interest
(takes out a disposable lighter) Cigarette lighter
Thumb here, press here - small flame appears
Bond, unimpressed, reaches for it - Saunders, 've lit cigarettes - Not from forty feet
Saunders flips the lighter sideways and -
burst of flame shoots across the room
The disposable lighter also contains a small self-detonation charge (beat) Depending on who - or what - you wish to dispose of
Bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it
Stop fidgeting, 007
Next - He takes out a pair of
Shoelaces
Plastique explosive shoelaces
(holding them out at length) Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe
(examining them curiously) Perfect way to tie up a
'Knotty' problem
(frowns) Moving along - (he produces:) typical plastic security card
Name here, magnetic information stripe here - (pointing to) And a code breaking microprocessor here
Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in
Does it work on cash machines
Saunders is suddenly stricken
Flustered
He blurts out: It was an authorized test
returned the money
(amused) see
(ignoring this) Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter
(needling him) If you can't do the time, don't do the crime
(smirks at Bond, pauses, then) Oh
almost forgot
There is one last thing: Before  retired, he asked that give you one other protective device
He hands Bond a
wedding band
What am  supposed to be able to do with this
believe 's exact words were: (imitating , emphatically:) "Hopefully, nothing
" Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused
Smiles: 'll give you a ring from Venice
Good luck on your mission, 007
He snaps the ring down on her desk
Till death do us part
: /  - - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge tarped hold - dominates the harbor
(Harmsway's
) Tonight, however, we find a , gliding through the water
Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed partygoers and musicians in medieval garb
Wearing the mask from 's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd
- swirl of colors, noise and music
Pushing his way into the chaotic celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face: White
Yellow
Red
Blue
Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right, anxiously looking for the contact
Who is it
appear in front of Bond
They curtsy, and giggle
Buona sera, signore - He's spun by a   with a bottle
Vino
Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a group of celebrants carrying a long banner
Suddenly, the   :  , carrying the is making its way through the square
Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look forward - left, right - when he    at his cape from behind
He can only crane his neck to see/hear - may have been followed
Meet me at the Church in five minutes
With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks behind him
- Five minutes later
Almost deserted
few stray couples
The appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and the moonlight, looking for Bond
Suddenly - Whomp
- an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove
Looking for someone
Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - removes her mask
She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007: Hello, James
Bond reacts
He is not happy to see her
Paris
What are you doing here
Is that any way to say hello
thought your specialty was good-bye
Paris smiles coyly
She    to tousle his hair - Oh, James
've missed you - (grabbing her by the wrist) Is this another one of your games
Stop it
You're hurting me
Can't you just be nice
've got half the British government breathing down my neck
don't have time for your nonsense
She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness
Don't you even miss me
Didn't mean anything to you
Nothing
She turns away from him, fighting back tears
Bond doesn't care: What about Elliot Harmsway
Or is this just another one of your stunts
(anguished) No
He's crazy - he's insane
He hates everybody
He's got these plans - (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:) You've got to help me, James
'm sorry
'm sorry for everything know  was wrong - but you've got to protect me
know you still love - She's stunned
He waits
She's angered: Do you feel better now
(not giving an inch) Do you
She turns away
Bond feels remorse for hitting her
Softens: What about the uranium
It's on the boat
He's holding a press conference tomorrow
Bond reaches out to touch her
She falls into his arms, burying her face in his shoulder
'm so sorry, James
promise, 'll never leave you again
(patting her head) Shhhhh
Just hold me
Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot backwards, to look in her eyes: How do you know Harmsway
Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder
She swoons: Kiss me
She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then  ,  him across the mouth
Bastard
Leave me alone
She shoves him off, darts away
Bond is bleeding from his mouth - and not altogether surprised at her behavior
He turns to see - -    - (' ) - Paris running to   dressed alike in three-corner hats, enveloped from head-to-foot in
Their faces are completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but their chins
They look like messengers of death
- The leader is ; the others are locals,  #1, #2, #3
( #1 is built like a bank vault
) Stamper looks steadily at Bond Who is he
Nobody
Just some drunk
Leave him alone - (to Thug #3) Take her to the boat
- He sees  and the   approaching
He turns and walks quickly toward - -  ()  - Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of the bridge
At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees - , approaching like a tidal wave
throws a look over his shoulder, and    , rushing up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins - completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top
turns to face the men
And suddenly    , dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession
hesitate for a moment - And       , just as the , and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper & Co
(to himself, flexing the cape) So that's how he does it
Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd
Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd
-  ()  - As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up: #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls
Spotting Bond, he charges - But gets caught between
He goes right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands, pulling the men down, after him
-   - Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade
He sees: , posing for a photo by the bridge - and just beyond this - hawking souvenirs from a
approaches the  with the camera, offering to take the picture for him
Prego, prego
Permissio
Grazie
Bond takes the camera
The tourists pose
And with perfect timing, Bond turns, and -
- sets off the  in  #l's face just as he comes around the corner
Bond flips the camera back to the tourist - Grazie - And heads for the
Wheeling it around, he   at the thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb
The     , knocking him on his back
The cart stops on top of him, pinning him down
takes off, threading through the crowd toward a
Meanwhile,    rushes to his wrecked cart
It in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet
He's getting really pissed off
He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as - 007 disappears down the sidestreet
Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by , chatting away
Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and - Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug #1 disappear onto the side Street
Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course along the canals toward - - Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street
Sticking close to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway
-      - Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza
'  - Stamper and Thug 2 charge in
Bond watches as they split up and start looking for him
-    - Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around: #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes
In one fast move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing it over the Thug's head
And as the Thug struggles to get out from under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out
(He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall
) - Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the courtyard of Il Bovolo
- Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak
Very quietly, he pulls out his gun, kneels
And as he brings the gun up to the cloaked figure's head, chambering a round - The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand, hurling him against the opposite wall
With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands
#2 Marco -  didn't know - #1 After him
They charge off
-  - Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls
No way out
Save for a   that leads up to the , overlooking the courtyard
- Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time
- The two Thugs enter the square
Motioning for quiet, they '  on the steps, and race up after him
- Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the building: Locked
Too heavy to burst in
He glances down at the courtyard, and   '  running up the stairs
Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape
Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the ,  for the He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and disappears from sight
Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase
- Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof
There are on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop to an adjoining building
Bond jumps
()  - 007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge
He looks down: The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof
As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof - - Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister
He's too heavy to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below
- Thug #1 searches for Bond
He   moving, below him, on the next building
He makes a running leap
()  - Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands
They grapple
The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond
, Bond is about to slide off, onto the skylight below, but     at the last moment
007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight
As Thug #1 tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by '
They sway in the air for a second
The  bends, breaks, and the two of them fall - , : - -
They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the Great Hall
Bond is winded
Thug #1, unfazed
He grabs Bond by the collar, hauling him up on his feet
Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up on his toes
Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond: #1 owe you some pain
With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back
Bond's chin just clears the barrel as
The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1
Bond snatches a , and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away
As    , the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally (yet effortlessly)    from 007's hand,
With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room
He's having fun
,       - #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond
shoves a    (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out of the way, like a gnat
Concerned this might be getting serious,  grabs an   from the shattered table
He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug
Unimpressed, the      a   , and plucks out a  - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword
With one roundhouse blow,  #1  '
The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to: - filled with pole weapons
Bond snatches a lethal-looking
(Ax, fluke and spike on a staff
) Thug #1 stops in his tracks
Drops the Claymore
Grabs a pole-ax
face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax
- Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond backward, to a    that features
(Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes
) Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the last minute
Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden
As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a - from the wall
( studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club) Bond swings the Morning-Star down,   #1' - But loses the weapon in the process
Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat
Grappling, they slam into the wall next to the   - which is holding it upright
- In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1 backwards, down onto the floor
-  - - #1   '
'   -
: #1
And at the very last second,    -, '    and - -     '  - The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor
- The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still clutching Bond's gun
Bond bends down and retrieves it
He fought hard
(holstering the gun) But the case was terminal
And on this note, we - : -    - Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white    sits at dock, festooned with pennants and banners
There's a crowd onboard
At the same time, however, 500 feet away
- Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence official in shirtsleeves
Two underlings hover in the background
You've confirmed all the legal details with
DiGIACOMO Si
Bueno
She's very
'Competent
'
For a woman
Let's go over this one more time
DiGIACOMO You will investigate the boat
You'll signal us if you find the enriched uranium
And then - (distracted) Pardon
He looks at a  who has appeared with a baby in her arms
/ Don Franco
just want to say we're voting for you in the election
DiGIACOMO (teasing, re: the baby) Both of you
/ (laughs) Of course
DiGIACOMO Grazie, grazie
Ciao
She leaves
He turns back Bond: DiGIACOMO So
You'll signal us if you find the uranium - And you'll wait until after the press conference - and everyone is gone - before you board the boat and arrest him
DiGIACOMO Perfecto
Then we turn him over to you, and the English government puts him on a military transport back to London
Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin
DiGIACOMO Do not worry, my friend
only want what is best
For both of us
Bond stands to leave
DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's savoring some private secret
He snaps his fingers to an underling: DiGIACOMO Rocco
Un Cappuccino
- As Bond makes his way up the gangplank - is holding a press conference near the bow, surround- ed by dignitaries
He is a man with an   - showing off all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most powerful media tycoons
And so, it's somewhat fitting that we are here today
To christen this environmental research boat in Venice - - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco Polo sailed forth to explore the world's great uncharted oceans
(beat) That 2/3 of the earth's surface where the sharks are not working members of the press
Laughter
Bond studies the man
Harmsway continues, pointing to a / , the size of a jet engine, attached to a long flexible hose/tube
With our six custom designed sea-bed coring drills, we will probe the long-term effects of pollution; our sonars, radars, and research labs will study the wind, the water, and the sea life that so dearly feeds us
Bond moves through the crowd
He spots a bulkhead, with a door
And so, in the spirit of international cooperation - thanking my good friend, Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected President of the Ukraine for all his assistance - He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience
give this boat to mankind - selflessly - in pure charity asking nothing for myself
But the cable  rights
Big laugh from the assemblage
Harmsway turns to a  : Miss Venice
If you'll do the honors - She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow
Now 'll take some questions from the press - even the few of you who aren't on my payroll
Laughter
Harmsway points to a reporter: #1 Mr
Harmsway: Why did you name this boat the Sea Dolphin
Actually, my first choice was 'No Comment
' So if someone asked where was,  could truthfully respond 'No Comment
' (laughter; he points) Over there
#2 Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in negotiations to move your offices from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur
(impishly) No comment
Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door
-   - Bond moves cautiously down a
And peers along a
He sees a , checking doors, making sure they're locked
Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The guard is at the far end of the hall
He lifts a -: Level one, secure
The guard exits, down another staircase
Bond moves stealthily down the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors:  , , ' , etc
Until he comes to: There's a   by the door
Bond slips out his -toy, swipes it
Click
He goes inside
-    - Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a And in the middle of the room - Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking for tamper-proof seals
Finds none
Gingerly, he opens it: They look like black tennis ball canisters
presses a button on his watch: Bond pauses
Wants to make sure
He spots    on a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result
Bond closes the box
He decides to check out the rest of the room - examining gadgets, tools, chemicals
- And finds a set of    ,
(They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside another ) Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight
He wonders what it is used for
Just then - '
Bond quickly replaces the cutting saw, moves to the first door - And as the   , Bond slips out the first, into the , down the hall, heading for the stairs
- enters, his hairless head shining under the lights
He looks around, sensing something is wrong
Glances: Not the red box
Not the Geiger counter
But then he notices it: is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch
Yung picks up a telephone
-  - Bond emerges from the bulkhead door
The press conference wrapping up
As Bond makes his way to the , looking out on the cafe - The maiden voyage begins tonight have some business in London - but the ship will sail down the Nile, across the South China Sea, stopping in Australia, winding up in San Francisco
Bond stands at the rail,    at the cafe - (cont'd) But having said that - let's get to the real business - the only thing that attracts newsmen faster than a breaking story the free food and beverage
- DiGiacomo sees the
Motions his men to action
-  - Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible
hand clasps his shoulder: ' Mr
James Bond
Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons
Valentin
What an unpleasant surprise
What is it that brings you to Venezia, Mr
Bond
Business - (sly glance to the thugs) Or somebody else's business
The goons chortle
Bond isn't happy with this attention
He clocks a        , scanning the deck
'    - brings Bond back to Valentin
She is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos
Dimitri
You promised  could go shopping
(sotto, to Bond) New mistress
(to her, impatiently) So
Go
need money
Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a
Here
Take an inch
Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond: Come
Let me buy you a drink
It's free
With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move several steps to the bar
(to the bartender) Two vodka martini's
Shaken
Not stirred
(to Bond) And you
Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion
One
As the bartender pours: must say, Valentin, capitalism seems to be treating you well
(belting one back) used to sell weapons; now  buy votes
(then) Off the record
Of course
If you can't beat the government, you might as well own it
Valentin spots someone off-camera
Wait -  want you to meet a friend of mine
(calling out) Elliot
Elliot
Come here
Harmsway appears
Ebullient as ever
Elliot Harmsway,  want to introduce you to an old friend - (putting out a hand to shake) The name is Bond
James Bond
Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile
Yet his words are ambiguous: Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects
(a nod to Valentin) Especially one with such distinguished friends
You might say 've always been one of Mr
Valentin's biggest followers
(chortling) 'Biggest followers
' He's practically made a career' of it
He laughs
Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot
Practically glows in the dark
(smiles) can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr
Bond
(signaling off camera) Darling
Come here
(beat) want you to meet my wife
woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat
As she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond - Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce you to James Bond
There is a terrified look on her face
Harmsway continues, beaming his most insinuating smile: But then
believe you two have already met
There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks
Then - The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by - , along with his own
DiGIACOMO Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices of the Italian government, , Franco DiGiacomo - (pauses; smiles at a camera; flash goes off) Am arresting you for the illegal possession of weapons grade enriched uranium
(to his underlings) Seize the boat
set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway
think  suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in Moscow
To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws
My friends, there's been a terrible mistake
(putting his arm around DiGiacomo) Come
Let me show you
And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door
Bond is left with Paris
She is white with fear
Bond moves to console her: Paris - Leave me alone
He's going to kill me
Why didn't you tell me
Why wasn't it in our files
(anguished) He didn't want anyone to know
He kept it out of the papers
He said a third wife was bad for his image
(beat) You've got to protect me
Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway
He pulls out a key: Go to my hotel room
'll be there in twenty minutes
Paris looks up at him like a hurt child
She wants some contact; she wants to hear him say ' love you
' Just - say it
Say it just once
(pauses, discomfited) One thing at a time
'll see you in twenty minutes
Go
She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door
And we pan up to see the , following him
-    - Harmsway holds court near the red box
Bond squeezes in
believe this is what you're looking for, Colonel
He opens the red box
Hoists out a canister
Is it uranium
Absolutely
But watch - (runs the Geiger counter over it) It's depleted uranium
Completely safe
child could sleep on it
Bond can't believe what he's seeing
DiGiacomo is mortified
received it from the Russian government - a by-product of their nuclear arms program - in the hopes that  could create tools for oceanographic research
(beat) It's what  was talking about: 'Swords into plowshares'
The Sprit of International Cooperation
DiGIACOMO Signore Harmsway
thousand apologies
(snaps his fingers to a lackey:) Give him the video tape
Please
No harm done, Don Franco
Go upstairs, and enjoy the reception
As the room empties, he calls - Oh - Mr
Bond
One minute
Bond approaches him
They're the only people in the room
hope you've enjoyed this little charade
Which part
The Colonel's
Or yours
(icily) piece of advice, Mr
Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton
(beat) It's deadlier than uranium
(staring him down) We'll see about that
Harmsway glances at his watch
Smiles coldly
Aren't you late for a meeting
/ - Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock
Jumps in a gondola
The Danielli
Presto
- Harmsway closes the door
Yung is there
That was too close
Don't worry
Mr
Bond will get the message
So will his boss
Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards
'm going to the plane
Tell the captain to set sail at once
- Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby
- Bond appears, rushing up a staircase
He comes to his doorway
It's closed, but unlocked
'   - Bond enters the room
Looks around, calling out - Paris
Paris
He sees the French doors open onto the canal
The curtains billowing outward
Bond rushes to the window and looks down: - ' Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water
- Crushed
Devastated
And to make matters worse: DiGIACOMO' Signore Bond
Bond turns
flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo
DiGIACOMO You're under arrest

Double watches, full alert
(beat) We're to send one encrypted positioning burst to London every six hours - otherwise, zero electronic emissions
The first officer nods
(cont'd) Inform the men, then run a surprise inspection
If someone paints us, don't want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god-damned Harrod's Christmas tree
Yes, sir
'll be in my cabin until oh-six- hundred hours
The Captain heads for the door

The officers salute as he exits
With a shrug, the picks up the  : Attention all hands

The First Officer looks over the shoulder of  at radar screen
Radar switched to passive mode; sonar re-set to low-power operation

Let's hope so
The First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning the horizon with binoculars

We'll all breathe a lot easier when we get this cargo back to London

After the last man has paid his respects,  stands, walks to the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single   in his dead wife's casket
'   -    - We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile
Steel, glass, chrome
The  men are seated around a giant conference table, looking absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire
Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein that hangs in the lobby of ,) walks to the head of the table, takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and: Good morning, Gentlemen
'm sorry to bring you here under these circumstances, but (beat) Considering our meeting was already scheduled, this was a happy coincidence
The men nod
Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel
(cont'd) Number One, your report
gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands
Sir Elliot: The entertainment division is releasing three new animated children's movies this year
(pause) By the time we're finished promoting them on our , radio, cable, newspaper, and magazine outlets - (pause) There won't be a parent in the universe who won't feel guilty if they don't take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys, books, video- games and clothing featuring our 'lovable little creatures
' (pause) We anticipate revenues of 3
1 billion dollars
Excellent, Number One
Build a better rat-trap, and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park
(turns to) Number Two
young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates
As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our software division has introduced a new computer operating system, Gates '99
(beat) It's deliberately filled with bugs - so people will be forced to buy our upgrades over the next five years
(beat) The window on revenues is 2
8 billion
Outstanding, Number Two
(beat, remembering:) By the way - Number Five -
(a man looks up) Who's ahead in the American elections
The Democrat, sir
By nine points
Maybe it's time to publish that story about his sex life
Even things up
close race is always better for our ratings
Consider him slimed, sir
Splendid
Next
(with noticeable reserve) Number Three
Your report
-  stands
Nervous
regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War
Haven't we already paid him for his services
Yes, sir
But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division
He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment
pause
The other men in the room shift uncomfortably
And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account
No sir
swear
This is not true
You disappoint me, Number Three
Harmsway presses a button
Stamper enters
Number Three assumes this means death
He    : Please sir
Please - But because  am a just man, 've decided to give Mr
Hussein what he deserves
Number Three is confused
Does this mean he's going to live
Mr
Stamper will escort you to the plane
(overwhelmed with gratitude) Thank you sir
Thank you
Harmsway nods, watching him leave: Good-bye, Mr
Azziz
And the man is gone
Harmsway turns his attention back to the room: Let's proceed with new business
Harmsway presses another button
The room darkens
The , and a 3-    rises into view
Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we are going to initiate phase one of the word's most perfect crime: The biggest theft in the history of mankind
(beat, pointing with a laser) Right here
In the Strait of Malacca
-   - Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three
He gets in
- He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously
They drive off
- (
/
- ) Number Three fidgets in the back
And notices Stamper smiling at him in the
He sees Stamper reach    - and
Is he going to get shot
Is it over
He winces, as - '
Gum
Shaking his head, he pulls out a  to mop the flop sweat
-     - Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,) Harmsway gets in the waiting  chopper
It powers up, takes off
-  - Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet
He opens the back door for Number Three
At last, the man believes he is safe
Thank you
Thank you so much
You must thank Sir Elliot for me
(producing a ) Here
Something to read on the plane
Stamper      #3'  - and gives him a friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs
At the doorway, Number Three looks back
Stamper smiles, waving: Bye-bye
- Number Three settles into his seat
The door closes; the engines wind up for take-off
He sighs: He's safe
He casually picks up the newspaper, snaps open the front page: ' "' : Screaming headline:
There's a underneath
Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and - (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of him
They smile
And on  ' - , we : - Moving through  in the   , night
- The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita- ble's command and control systems
At the   , the ship's course has been charted from Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca
Standing in front of the map, however,    seems perplexed
He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper in his hand
Something is wrong
This doesn't make sense
What's our heading now
looks down at his compass/auto-pilot
/- - moving from West to North - then holding on a North position
Zero one three
Due north
The two officers share a look
Something is odd, but - We're on course again
Just then, the    from the exterior bridge
Can't see a damn thing in this fog
(calling out) Rating: What have we got
He joins the  and '  at their scopes
passenger ferry and two freighters broadcasting on low-band - And two small fishing boats about 30k north
No radar, but we've identified their engine signatures
As the First Officer takes this in: (
) Damn
It's doing it again
(joining him) What's wrong
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west
He points down to the compass/auto-pilot,
Then re-sets us to the north
The compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back
(cont'd) The Captain wants us on the East side of the channel
Cross current
Not in the Strait
(to the Navigator) How's our position
According to the satellite, we're exactly on course
Did you check the auto-pilot
The back-up does the same thing
Check it again
What about the global positioning satellite
Could there be something wrong with the signal
Two words: Im-possible
- As the earth turns below, a    appears in the distance: , spinning slowly on its axis
It comes closer and closer to camera, until it   , and the  on its body   : -

How is it now
Seems to be back to normal, sir
The First Officer nods
Then  a

The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen

Floating vertically

(off the others' quizzical looks) Water logged timber
Floats straight up
You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west

Engines to half
Aye-aye sir
Engines to half

- The ship is moving towards a    - Harmsway's - (shorthand " ',) attached to a long flexible dredging pipe
-      - Motionless, hanging in the water
Then the monster awakes:  metal sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle
- The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with : 'm getting an electrical emission, sir
Extremely close
Bearing 240 - The First Officer is surprised
All hell is about to break loose:       - Punch up the radar - 've got it, sir
large craft - , tons
Range - (disbelief) 200 yards
It's anchored in a cove
That's impossible
We're in the middle of the channel
Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge: Breakers off the port bow
We're heading for shore
Sir - (reacting to the Jr
Officer) Full stop
Call the captain
Sir
(annoyed) What
The log is moving
- Propelled by water-jets in its head, , emitting a   whine as its drill bit revs up to speed
The drill's   glisten in the water
'  - (, ) Closing in on the hull like a torpedo
It gets closer, picking up speed, until - on  - - engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm bursts/drills through the hull
As they scream, drowning - scrambles up, one step ahead of the water, through a bulkhead, into - - () Where the  and   struggle to (on the intercom) We've been hit
We're taking water
- Alarms sound
Red lights flash
Flooding in the engine room
Get me damage reports
Start the pumps
(holding out a ship's phone) It's the Captain - #1 - On a phone, outside the ship's , deep in the hull: What the hell is going on
(intercut if necessary) think we've been holed, sir
On my way
He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door, slamming it behind him
Meanwhile, on - - The engines are gone
Flooding on  deck
Sound the general alarm
Seal all compartments
As the Second Officer grabs the intercom - (into intercom) Attention all hands - '  - The crew members look up from their meals - (continuing) Proceed to emergency stations - - The men have closed the door, but
- , from the other side
They exchange a quizzical look; they don't know what to make of it, when: The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls
- The lights go out
Everyone is scrambling: We've lost power
Go to back up generators
(into intercom) Repeat: Seal all compartments, and - '  - In the dim lighting - (on intercom) Proceed to emergency stations at once
The men start to move, but halt at
They look around: Where is it coming from
Suddenly a The men are swept off their feet
/ #2 - As the Captain rushes up the steps, he turns around, reacting to a - '  -   -  - Water blasts through, like 1000 fire hydrants turned on full
With terror in his eyes,   sprints up the rest of the stairs, through a water-tight door, into: #3 - Where the Captain secures the door behind him, and rushes away
- desperate battle continues: Flooding on -Deck
Where the hell are those generators
Coming up, sir
Get those pumps working
- hurriedly flips switches
The lights flicker
And just as they some to life, brightly - , and a wall of water and debris blows in, destroying everything in its wake
- Lights out
sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room: The back-up is gone
Flooding up to -Deck
We can't hold out much longer, sir
All eyes are on the First Officer
Will he save them
Where the hell is the Captain
( #3) - Running, the Captain is about to reach the exit door
Hearing the relentless grinding behind him, he throws a look over his shoulder: The entrance door  in a thunderball of water
The Captain clambers through the exit door to: #4 - short hall: He shuts the entrance door, runs to the exit
He looks hack again: The door blasts open - and the torrent of water continues the chase, as if it's got a personal vendetta against him
He exits to: #5 - Slamming the door behind him, the Captain looks ahead, and up: He throws a look back: Sprinting for his life, the Captain rushes up the stairs, two at a time
The humming behind him grows louder
He glances back: He rushes up the last four steps, just as - -
With    , the Captain turns to face the oncoming tsunami
We cut to: '  - (,
#5) Moving like a shark
Toward  ' , As it closes in for the kill - - Shifts, suddenly, to the stern
confusion of anxious voices: Slipping to stern
All major compartments flooded
With all hands still awaiting orders - Papers fly
Men slide
The First Officer has no choice: Abandon ship
Break radio silence
Send our position
-   - The Communications Officer types: "Top Secret
Indian Ocean Naval Command
Indomitable Sinking
" (calling out) What's our position
(reading off his screen) One hundred degrees, thirty-one minutes, and seven seconds East, by two degrees, twenty-nine minutes, ten seconds, North
As he types, the room lurches again, tilting more to the stern
- (,  #5) As the passageway shifts, tilting to the stern, the Captain screams and
- is sucked down into the water - the worm's vortex - like meat being fed into a Cuisinart:  churning, spinning death
-  - Bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under
- manage to get a  away
scramble up from below and leap into the water
The bow is at a forty-five degree angle
And the
Indomitable pauses - for just a moment - before  , , throwing up a series of great waves
- Rocked by waves from the sinking ship
The Cook, a Marine, and Three Crewmen hear a splash along side
Two of the Crew pull the aboard
He takes a minute to catch his breath, then: Six
That's it
Only six of us
Most of the crew never made it to their life jackets
The Captain
(shrugs, then:) The First officer stayed on the bridge
One of the      : Hey - look
Over there
- (  -    - ) The    emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white apparition in the fog
- The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved
-  - Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face
Turns to , standing next to him at the rail: Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it
Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy
Oblivious, Harmsway looks at his , then looks through the  again - and begins to the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "'
" ("All  want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air") - As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed
He hears the hum
His eyes follow the churning water
And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air
- Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling
Stamper appears, hands Harmsway a piece of paper
We've decoded their last transmission
Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles
Perfect
They'll be searching miles from here
(then) Time for phase two
You can get the men in the water
And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling "Wouldn't It Be Loverly
" Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee
You heard him
Get the men in the water
-       -  - In the water next to the chip,   drop the last of their equipment in a
They cast off, motoring into the fog
-   - The classic Michelin building on Fulham road
- is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date
can't believe it took us so long to finally get together
What exactly do you do for the government
(after a beat) You might say
'Public relations
' How fascinating
bet you meet all the most fabulous people
Before Bond can answer, the  ' interrupts
' Excuse me - Mr
Bond
You have a call
Bond excuses himself

You're early
You weren't supposed to call until - (he stiffens) Yes
understand
Twenty minutes
- Passing a    with an ad for "" ("The Paper that Never Lies,") Bond's -5 roars past the guard
-    - glares as   enters to address , ,   , and various  and
Good evening
've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour
(beat) For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago - (interrupting) Excuse me, but - (all turn to him:) must formally protest this meeting
Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy -  see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or -6
(beat, as  and Tanner exchange a look) This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy
(furious) Admiral, are you suggesting - He's distracted by the
All turn to entering, wearing a

Sorry 'm late - Actually, you're just in time
(she turns to) Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you
(deflated) Yes
Of course
've looked forward to meeting you
Bond sits
glances at Johnstone as if to say "proceed
" As  was saying: Approximately forty- five minutes ago, we received an abandon ship signal from the
Indomitable

Tanner of -6 -the ship is presumed lost here, just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she broadcast her last position
: -  - Foreground, empty diving boat
Background, Sea Dolphin , with the "flexible hose" hanging over the rail, down into the water
-    - Stamper works "worm" master control with a video joystick
Divers approaching the hull
Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at: -   - Through the worm's  camera,   with  and are about to enter the  in the Indomitable's hull
(The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the divers and the worm's functions
) -  - The worm follows the Divers into the hull

- It trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman

The Divers react, and the worm follows them into

- The Divers and worm travel to a
Lighting the welding torches, they try to cut through the metal bars
Unsuccessfully
-   - One of the Divers turns to the worm's camera
He  into his diving helmet's microphone: (through speaker) It's titanium
we can't cut through
- Stamper turns to Harmsway: 'll do it
(into microphone) Divers, stand aside
-  -  - The worm moves into position to grind through the hatch
protective cover slides over the lens, and the grinder whorls into life
- The grinder stalls for an instant as it encounters the titanium bars
- One of the      as it hits the titanium, and starts to grind through
Once past the bars, the grinder cuts easily through the steel door
Trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment
The Divers push the worm to one side; two of them enter the hold with lights
The worm follows
The two other divers remain behind to feed the worm's flexible tubing through the door
-  - The Divers' lights illuminate the hold:    , as far as the eye can see
-    - Harmsway looks at the video screen
Gentlemen:  do believe we've struck gold
Four minutes ahead of schedule
-  - The worm closes its "eye", revs up its grinders, and attacks the first pile of gold Bars
It runs through them like butter
-    - The bloodletting and recriminations have begun
This plays fast: (incredulous) One-third of the British gold reserves
(beat) What kind of idiot loses - (looks to the treasury officer) What is it
The equivalent of ten billion  dollars
(sheepishly) Give or take
Depending on today's currency rates - (ignoring him) What the hell was the gold doing on that boat
We were bringing it back from Hong Kong
Under orders from the Treasury
During the cold war, we stored a third in America, and another third in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear attack
And with the turn-over of Hong Kong to the Chinese - Why wasn't the ship protected
Why was it sailing without radar
resent your tone, sir
have men who are missing - And  have the entire British economy to worry about
(breaking in) Minister - (all turn to him) Obviously, -6 was not involved in this operation
But  have to defend the Admiral
Roebuck looks at Bond with great surprise
Bond continues: (cont'd) Electronic silence was the safest way to move that gold
Otherwise, any country - or individual - with the crudest missile could just lock onto our signals, and take out the boat
(beat) That's what happened to the Sheffield in the Falklands
(beat) Since then, it's standard operating procedure for any sensitive shipment
(frowns) At least we know where the gold is
When are the recovery ships due
36 hours
They've already sailed from the Persian gulf
expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours
Until then, 'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to , the press, the
(beat, looking at:) And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters,  want him to go along as an observer
Are we agreed
Yes
Yes
As you wish
- Harmsway walks along the side of the ship, observing the operation: The '   sucks up the ground-up    - , (through the  hanging over the side,) and dumps it into a At each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom of the sluice, and excess water flows off the side of the ship
- where all the water has been drained off, leaving a cascade of gold nuggets pouring into the ship's hold - reaches into the shimmering cascade, and takes a hand-full of gold
He sees Stamper approaching
Remember the golden rule, Mr
Stamper: He who has the gold, rules
He drops the gold back in the hold
Is the helicopter ready
Fueled and waiting
Good
We have an appointment in Hong Kong
-    -  - and Bond, striding down a hallway to exit the building
You're turning into quite the politician, 007
have an excellent teacher
(sideways glance) 'Make sure you wear the uniform'
(ignoring his jibe) What do you make of all this
It doesn't quite add up
They've come to a door
Pause as he opens it
He explains: The infrared satellite images
No heat, no flame, no explosion
If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface
Sabotage
three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air
She nods and pushes through the door
He follows
-  -  - 've already contacted our station in Kuala Lumpur
They're lining up a local contact
(beat) want you to find that gold, and secure it
They've arrived at her car
The door is already open
Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur
She turns, freezes Bond with a look: Contrary to what you may believe, 007, the world is not filled with mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes, stock them with big-breasted women, and threaten the world with nuclear annihilation
Bond reacts to the comeuppance
She continues: (cont'd) The case is closed
The Italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide
We had enough trouble keeping your name out of the media
For everyone's sake - (beat) Your job is to find the gold
Not settle some personal score with Elliot Harmsway
' ' (    ) -   - Super:
Harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous tinker-toy-styled building in the Central district
- comes down firmly on a legal document
(of the People's Revolutionary Army) is seated with a squad of lawyers: And that is the fifth document
With your counter-signature, the sale will be complete
The document is passed across to , sitting with his own legal counsel
One of the men is   , : Are you sure
If we waited - Harmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him
Addresses the General: General Li: My young associate here has just informed me that if  waited a year,  could perhaps receive a higher price for this building
(beat, wryly) He has great faith in Hong Kong
As did my ancestors
With obvious results
Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved
(cont'd) Yet to sell this building for more money - to profiteer - would run counter to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual trust and obligation; it would violate the ancient principles of feng shui - (beat) - the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four, and why this building has a fifth, non-functioning ventilation shaft on its roof
(beat) Wind and water, fire and rain, earth and sky - feng shui
All things - at one, in balance, with nature
Most eloquently put, Sir Elliot
Thank you, General Li
Now 'll just sign this last document - He puts the pen to the paper, and
Alarmed looks
(cont'd) Terribly sorry
Mr
Stamper
From behind, Stamper hands him a pen
Harmsway innocently starts to sign in   - Sir Elliot
Red ink - Of course
How foolish
More bad luck
'll just borrow yours - He takes General Li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish
' ' - Under the whirring blades of the chopper, Harmsway bids farewell to General Li
He and Stamper get in helicopter
- As Harmsway waves good-bye from the window, the helicopter rises, a   attached to the
- The cable leads to a spool, which runs to the Harmsway referred to in the last scene
-  - Harmsway pops open a bottle of champagne
An old Chinese toast to our friends
- The General
He reacts with horror
/   - Harmsway glances down to watch the    onto the General and his aides, scattering them like rats
In the chopper, the pilot cuts the cable, and Harmsway lifts a champagne glass: Confusion to the enemy
In 48 hours, that building - and all of Hong Kong around it - will cease to exist

He's standing over several seated at radar, sonar, and navigation consoles

Negative bounce
We should be right over it
They hear a    - 2 Wait - 'm getting something
Where
What is it
The man points at one of the screens, where Bond sees a , with the   of a

Lots of data: 2 The Shinjuku
Japanese troop carrier
World War
Let's make another pass
- (calling out) We have traffic on the deck - They look down and see an  (Harmsway News Network) boat
Get rid of them
-
&   - The chopper hovers above the  boat - (on pa speaker) Please leave the area
please leave the area
( )-   - We're looking up at the world's tallest building: The 1500' twin Petronas Towers
(They look like an architectural collaboration between Friz Lang and
Wells
) At the 50th floor, there's a sky bridge connecting the buildings, where - - ( ) - Elliot Harmsway strides out of an elevator (in Tower 1,) into a group of waiting assistants
Without breaking stride - 1 Good morning Sir Elliot
Welcome to Kuala Lumpur - Morning, morning all
What have we got
His   rushes to keep up, reading from a pad, as they cross the sky bridge to 's main reception area, in Tower 2: The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch - Pencil it in for the next trip - The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story - Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain  have no control over what my journalists write - Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian  stations No - The Queen invited you to dinner - Yes - And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting
Excellent
They've passed from the bridge, through reception, into: -   -  - glass conference roam, whose    obscure the view of the
(We'll see this, in full, later
) Meanwhile, a    react to: Morning, all my golden retrievers
What kind of havoc shall we create in the world today
1 -  ferry sank and burned in Pakistan; 457 dead
Good
2 American jetliner down in Omaha - Better
3 Economic summit ends in Tokyo - Boring - 1 Riots broke out at the World Cup soccer finals - Dog bites man
(explains) Man bites dog is a news story
Riots at the World Cup soccer finals is a social announcement
Next
4 This just came in: There's something up with the British Navy in the Strait
Rescue planes, helicopters; two ships supposedly sailing from the Persian gulf
They just chased away one of our news boats
(feigning complete innocence) Is that so
4 Yeah
Sounds like a plane went down or something
Either way, they're calling it - all together now: " routine training exercise
" 'm shocked
Issue the usual vehement protest: Freedom of the press, people's right to know
Lather it up with a lot of righteous indignation
(off their laughter) Next
-  - Frowning, Bond peers at the Sonar Operator's screen
Still nothing
The operator shakes his head
The pilot calls back from the cockpit: - Commander Bond: They've found one of the crewman's bodies
-  -    - The Sea King comes in above several police cars and boats
Bond jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off
(
) Yo
Jimbo
Bond turns to look: It's
Wade, what the hell are you doing here
am not here, ol' buddy
The  has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong
That's reassuring
Hey - the world is my office
Let's take a look at the body
As Bond moves off,    , savoring the aroma: Smells like
Coffee plants
- pulls a white sheet from the body
(We don't see it
) Bond and Wade look down at something gruesome: Colorful
Shark attack
Bond shakes his head grimly
don't think so
The veins are cauterized - as if they were sealed by heat
(beat, confounded) But there are no burn marks on the flesh
It doesn't make sense
(to the policeman) Who found the body
(points to) Dato
Local fisherman
Says it came in with the tide early this morning
Ask him if it could have washed in from the west side of the Strait
The  has an animated conversation with
Then: No
He says it's not possible
The current could have only brought the body in from the east
(to Wade) You have a boat
don't know if you'd call it a boat
Something with an engine
Not oars
Step into my office
'  '   -    -  - Smashing through the water at breakneck speed
Wade and Bond yell over the engines
What do you want with the Harbor Master
Tide and current charts
Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank
(Wade nods appreciatively) Where did you get the boat
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok
(beat) Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades
Bond looks at Wade: The man remains, forever deranged
-  - The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing boats, etc
series of long dockways jut out into the harbor
- (  - ) - Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the docks
Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower: Over there
Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels
- /'  -   - is   them, on a dead collision course
in a baseball cap is at the wheel
pulls his boat to the right; the    , rocking the cigarette boat with its wake
and  clock the woman - who we will later learn is Wade stares after her: think 've just seen my next future ex-wife
(seeing they're about to crash) Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy
Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course
-   -  - Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines
Wade joins him
By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened to that girl - in Cuba -
Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office
Natalya
Yeah
Russian Minister of Transportation
She married a hockey player
envy your 'undercover' assignments
(a look, then) We work in the dark
We do what we can
-   - The local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter
Wind, tide, currents
You're the second person today asked for a full set of charts
(holds out a clipboard) If you'd just sign here - Bond takes the clipboard - - read signature:
Bond returns the clipboard: Thanks
(apparent afterthought) By the way - was there anything strange the night before last
Odd weather, lost boats -
No
Unless you're talking about the bus problem
Bus problem
Captain Cheong's ferry was late
He runs the line across the Strait between here and Sumatra
The lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus
Slept on the docks
Hundreds of them
Thanks
'  - Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade
have to get these to London
Do you know this Captain Cheong
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club
Can you arrange a meeting
Hell
The  built that club
- Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces
- local band plays on the verandah
We find Wade at a with five local Malay Chinese
He   , exuberantly: Okay gentlemen
The name of the game is 7-card Cambodian stud
Everything is wild
And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a white dinner jacket, sitting with
The Captain is elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch
(To be put into local dialect
) In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr
Bond
know
Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships
Sometimes kill the crew; other times - (points to his eye) Torture them
'm sorry
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night
Captain blamed the auto-pilot;  suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem
Did you test the auto-pilots
The satellite positioning receiver
Next morning
Both boats
Nothing wrong
(chuckles) My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon
' (smiles, standing to leave) appreciate your time - Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch
Owns a marine salvage company
Nobody knows more about the Strait
Where can  find him
Him
He, is a she - (points) at the bar
-   - , about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,) beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears: Bourbon
Neat
wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat
Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond
She looks him up and down - as if deciding whether this specimen is worth her time
Her conclusion: definite - though skeptical - maybe
She gives him a sultry smile: Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things
Be reckless
- And  bet you always leave turmoil in your wake
(thinking, 'not bad') Have we met
This afternoon
Our boats practically kissed in the harbor
(holds out his hand to shake) James Bond
Sidney Winch
The
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred
(to Sidney) And another for you
No
But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro
She steps back  a huge , , wearing a dark suit and tie, sitting on a stool
Taro smiles menacingly at Bond
Boyfriend
Chaperone
'm waiting for my dinner date
Pity
(to Bartender) Bring him whatever he wants
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr
Bond
(beat) Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage
Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London
Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug
2) She's in marine salvage
3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts
4) She's a smart-ass
He decides to see if he can rattle her: Actually, 'm here on business
You might say it was a
Golden opportunity
(a chill in her voice) And exactly what business are you in, Mr
Bond
Insurance
Lloyds of London
(daggers in her voice) The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr
Bond
few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here
Including life insurance
'll keep that in mind
(looking off) see my date is here
(to Taro) And  think Mr
Bond is ready to leave
Nice to run into you again
Let's not make it a habit
She exits
Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the room
Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder - think you should go - Not quite yet, Taro - And from '  - Sidney greets  with a big hug
Uncle Elliot
Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of Harmsway
Taro tightens his grip - said you should - But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back- ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon
Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking
Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie
Wade appears, jubilant, with a wad of cash: Yo
Jimbo
won five hundred - (seeing Taro) What happened
He tied one on
-  - Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end
/
-  - Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean- going craft
On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object
As Bond reaches for the  , it opens by itself - and a succession of     in   emerge
Good morning
Good morning
(calling back into the cabin) He's arrived
Bond turns from the door to watch the women
He hears: ' You're late 007
've been expecting you
emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot
He's irritated: How are you
Retired
'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore
'm sorry
It was a national emergency - That hardly makes up for the imposition
(beat) Now, for what  hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007
(he unfurls a map:) First, computer generated retrograde analysis map
Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here
Do you have any idea of what any of that means
In English
Not a clue

don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me
Next - walks to the large object on the aft-deck
Pulls off a tarp: Your new car

Yes
And do try to keep all four of them on the road
(continuing) All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns - (shows him a key fob) Fully operational remote control
Drives forward, reverse - (Bond presses a button, opening a window) Stop that

17 Beverage cup holders
Standard equipment
The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders
Bond nods, and   a distraction from the

Don't even think about it

They're my granddaughters
-  - Clear skies and blue water
The only vessel in sight is a thirty- five foot    underway at full throttle
,   -  - Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding 's map
Slow down
We're close
Wade pulls back on the throttle

The is trolling against a background of sandy beaches and the lush green hills of Sumatra
- Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display
dunno, Jimbo
It can't be out here
How could they get this far off course
(concentrating on the sonar) Who knows
Fog, night
They'd never sail this close to the shore
Wait a minute - (beat, pointing to the screen) 've got it
There
Off the port bow
- The murky electronic outline of a ship
- Bond watches the sonar screen
Wade slows engines, consults charts
Cut the engines
It's about two- hundred fifty feet down
: - (    ) - By Wade
Bond is strapping on his scuba tank
Two-fifty's pretty deep for air
You should really be using mixed gases
Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks
'll make a bounce dive
If  can keep my bottom time short, 'll be all right
Bond gathers up , and sits on the gunwale
(only half teasing) Keep your eye out for pirates
Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal  -

That's reassuring
Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears
- Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward, handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom
- Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom
Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel
-  - Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand
Bond lights a , and the scene is suddenly alive with color
From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being lost beyond range of his flare
Bond checks his air gauge
- Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining
- Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable
He pauses to study the damage
Then enters
-  - Bond sees the damage on the passageway door
Swims through it
-   - The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the busted bilge-hold hatch
Again, he pauses to examine the marks made by the worm
He drops into the hold
-   - The gold is gone
Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing
vast empty space
Bond's flare sputters and dies
He drops it, lights another
As he turns to exit,   on the deck below the hatch
He moves toward it
-  - half-chewed   is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead
Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold
Just as he yanks the bar out, a   lashes out from behind the brace, baring its teeth
Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into: -(
) -   - where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling
Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see: - Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll- ing under some debris
Regaining his composure, Bond , then moves to retrieve the flare
/ - Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover
He notices the
He picks it up, stuffs it into his sack, and swims off
: -  - Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up
On the way, he glances at his gauges: - Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below   - empty
The ambient light level on the gauges suddenly
- - black  has blotted out the light
And straight at 007

He looks up again: One carries a strange-looking - ; another trails a The divers have fanned out, looking for 007

(Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat
) One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask

Interesting point
Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage
Get him up
Take his belt
(motioning to Wade) Take the two of them to the Captain
The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade
By the way
almost forgot
(smashing Bond) owed you one
Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze of various cutthroat crew members
Wade is completely unfazed
(sniffs the air) Smell that Jimmy
Sea Kelp
Bond gives Wade a look
Hey - it could be worse
At least they speak English
Bond glances up at a crew member,   , smiling
Somehow, that's not reassuring
-   - We're back in Bond-land:  high-tech control room, with lots of monitors and white-suited
Bond and Wade are pushed through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons
Here they are, Captain
The "Captain" turns from a monitor: '
Just give me one goad reason - Mister Bond, from Lloyds of London - why shouldn't kill both of you, burn your boat, and use your bodies for shark bait
(chirping up) So you two know each other
Small world, ain't it
What happened
Commitment problems
Who is he
Sidney Winch, meet - Jack Wade
Citibank
Commercial loan division
If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat - - Shut up
(to Wade) You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life
(pauses) But she won't kill us
No
No
First, because  don't think it's in your nature
And second, because there's no gold down there
So charming
So suave
(beat) Don't insult me
'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies
So it was commitment
Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong knows what's on that boat and 'm claiming it
One-third of that gold is mine
That's fine, but - even a little London girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing
There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes
She turns to Taro: Was he carrying anything
Taro holds up the '  , indicating 'nothing'
Angrily: Search him
The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks
Nobody moves
Do  have to do everything around here

Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond
As she    , we cut to

Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded
Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own
If  were you - - You're not
(as she hoists the bullhorn) Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there
Thank you
(clicks it on, and:) "Now hear this: Drop dead

There's a pause, then - '      -
It's only a warning shot, but - Except for Bond and Wade, who might as well be having tea
Bond looks down at Taro, cowering on the boards
Gatling gun beats Uzi

That would be me - (snidely) Thanks for your message

Yes - Guard
Arrest these men

Bond and Wade are stunned
The Marines move in
Bond struggles - Wait a minute - Get them out of here
If he says one word, shoot him
As   with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the folding bridge - (demanding) What's your name
Captain Morton
Pause
She expects him to ask "And yours

My name is Sidney Winch, and - Good for you, Miss Winch
You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here

These are international waters
The British Navy abandoned that boat, and 'm claiming it
Under international law,  have the right to salvage what's on that wreck
Fifteen seconds
Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney

Hmmm
suppose this is a step above that profession
(beat) Ten seconds
Are you leaving
No
You leave me no alternative
(upholstering a walkie-talkie) Cut her anchor
As Sidney yells "

One short, bone rattling burst
You won't get away with this
(stepping onto the bridge) Good-day, Miss Winch
advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground
As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade: You bastards
Believe me - you haven't heard the last of me
-   -  - Bond, Wade and the Captain
- Nice trick with the arrest
Very convincing
It's no trick, Mr
Wade
've got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig
Don't you think you're overreacting
(with great sarcasm) Yes
The famous James Bond
've heard all about you, sir
You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed  cowboy - (Wade reacts) Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide
(Calmly) That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: (beat) There's no gold down there
What are you talking about
We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there
Yes, the ship is down there
But the gold is gone
That's absurd
It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold
know what  saw - don't care what you think you saw
You're a damned amateur
(beat) Just get off my ship
Go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals
(exchanges a glance with Wade, then) Aye-aye, Captain

But  think there's someone  want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur

Bond picks up the phone
Bond
' Hello, Mister Bond
(with an edge) Who is this
'   - Harmsway is perched on a desk
In the background, , we can see Harmsway's   serving someone coffee from a   - but we can't see who it is
Elliot Harmsway
heard you were in and thought we might get together for a chat
- (
'  - ) - (Cont'd,
) We seemed to get off on the wrong foot back there in Venice
How did you get this number
: Oh, please, Mr
Bond
We live in the information age
Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information
(Bond reacts, sourly) Besides  own the phone company
What do you say
Twenty minutes
'm on my way
Bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination
'   - Harmsway hangs up;  is standing nearby
Harmsway throws a concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper: Let's find out exactly what he knows
-  -( ) -   - Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for , looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance
-   -   - Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp into an underground car park

Both wear the colorful  used by all Harmsway Building service personnel
(from inside the car) James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway
Yes
'm to bring you right up
The valet will take your car - 'd prefer to park it myself
(off her questioning look) Temperamental
Practically has a mind of its own
Don't they all
She points to a spot near the loading docks
Bond drives off
'  - Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get- away
He looks through the windshield, surveying the area
'  -    - (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a bulletproof security desk
There's a   by the door
(
' ) - Reaching inside his jacket, Bond   , and   in a compartment under the dashboard
- The   joins Bond as he locks the car with the
Right this way
Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms
- Bond and the  Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with looking down into a mammoth
(moving to a door) Mr
Harmsway is checking the afternoon editions
If you'll just follow me - - The      is deafening
Bond and the walk down a   to the pressroom floor, where - Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking with   - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in his hands
(spotting Bond, yelling:) Mr
Bond
Nice to see you
Sir Elliot
Come
Let's get out of the noise
(escorting Bond off) - 'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk
-    - Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from the press room to an elevator
There's a  in the room
It's funny, Mr
Bond
Of all the things  own, nothing gives me as much enjoyment as my newspapers
He moves to the sink to wash his hands
Turns on the faucets: (cont'd) Ironic, isn't it
In the age of , still can't get the ink out of my veins
Bond  , looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink: Yes
man with ink in his veins, and blood on his hands
Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe
But decides to ignore it
He turns off the faucet, dries his hands - We print 31 newspapers here; another two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world
He pulls on his 2000 Saville Row suit-jacket
And how many of those newspapers carried Paris Harmsway's obituary
Harmsway turns, and presses the
The doors open, instantly
: All of them, Mister Bond
(motioning inside) After you
- The doors close
Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling
Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm: Before  became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men
(beat) Playboys
Thrill seekers
Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her
see
tried to save her
But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior
Delusions of grandeur
wonder if it runs in the family
(bursts out in a laugh) The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr
Bond, is the degree of success
He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50
Still,  do miss her
only wish she could have lived to see all this
can feel your pain
The doors open: By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond
Sightseeing
Harmsway motions for Bond to exit
They step out into: (" ") - short hallway lined with   of Harmsway's ancestors
Double doors at both ends
(People passing through
) As they walk - call this the Rogue's gallery
Yes
can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives
(pointing to the first portrait) My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese
(moving to) His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai
(moving to) His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium
And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper
(pausing, wistfully) It was a city of unlimited possibility
So why did you leave
Because it's a dying city
Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow
(moving to the last two portraits) In any case, this is my father, Charles: royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations
Said 'd never amount to anything, but
(passing his own portrait) turned it into this He pushes through a door, into: -   - cavernous    bristling with activity
At the center is the main   , (where a news broadcast is in progress,) surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la
Around the perimeter of the room are    looking out on Kuala Lumpur
All are broadcasting:  Larry King-type chat show; ; ; a  where a chef is preparing something flambeed
With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect is overwhelming
Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter: Welcome to the new world order, Mr
Bond
(starting to walk) Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions;  have my divisions: (pointing) News, sports, business, entertainment
And these are my foot soldiers: (a wave of his hand) 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable channels - in 35 languages
And still not a thing to watch
He glances at the   , with a -type
Although it must be fun to have all those satellites
They're merely tools to disseminate information
(wryly) Or disinformation
If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course
Maybe one degree a minute
(guffaws) Fantastic idea Mr
Bond
Perhaps should buy it for a book
It's totally preposterous, but - (off Bond's reaction) You amuse me
And now perhaps can amuse you
He stops at a
Begins to type
Let's see
First we have this James Bond
believe he's a field adjuster for Lloyd's of London
- ' -6  - Then we have this James Bond
- '   - (reading from the screen) Licensed to Kill
(aside) Not a bad title for that book
(then) Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond - - '   - Who  believe they call "007
" Bond is not amused
Harmsway is enjoying himself: You see, Mr
Bond, you and  are both men of action
But your era is passing
Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery
And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther
Words to live by
Your choice
(glancing at his watch) Look at the time
Come
There's someone  want you meet - about a story 'm thinking of publishing
As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's " don't care what you think you know -  can crush you" attitude
And now, Harmsway plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off the one other loose thread in his perfect crime: '  - The  opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond
He calls to someone we don't see: Hello, dear
'm sorry  took so long - :  is sitting across from his desk
That's okay, Uncle Ell - She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond
Bond is equally surprised
What is  doing here
see you two have met
Briefly
(crossing to his desk) Don't pout, Sidney
invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story
He's from 'Lloyd's of London
' (sly glance to Bond) Aren't you, Mr
Bond
He's not going to tell the truth
He was diving for the gold
Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly: It seems - Mr
Bond - that Miss Winch has told me the most incredible story: sunken British warship filled with gold; a British cutter firing on her; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the Strait
Bond isn't enjoying this charade
Obviously, the British government denies all of this - -  told you
He was there
- - But as 've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story
Don't you agree Mr
Bond
Before Bond can answer - But  have proof
You ran out of here so fast,  didn't get to show you
Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses
(forcing a smile) And what's that, my dear
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to - Sidney cuts Bond off,     on Harmsway's desk
He brought that up from the wreck
see
Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again - Sidney,  wouldn't - Too late
She drops the uranium tooth on his desk
And what about this
Any idea what this is
Silence
Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look
Then: believe it's a depleted uranium drill bit, my dear
Bond reaches for the
Why don't we just take these - (blocking him) No
want Sir Elliot to keep them
Harmsway stands, comes around the desk: Well
do believe this requires further investigation
Thank you, Uncle Elliot
No matter what the British government says,  won't kill this story
(his secretary appears in the doorway) Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator
And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later
'm sure they will
Good-bye, Mister Bond
He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long
Good-bye, darling
Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter
-  - As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances out the  , with its view of the other tower
Thank you both for coming in
'  -
- Five floors directly down is the -  ; just above him, he sees    being pulled up on a - ; the elevator doors open
Bond and Sidney ad-lib good-byes to the secretary and get in
- Sidney presses the button for "1"
Bond glances at the  - with reads "55" - clocks the   - and starts looking for an
Sidney watches out of the corner of her eye, thinking he's nuts
(glancing at the security camera) Do you have a gun
What
(yanking it down) You heard me
gun
(disabling it) left mine in the car
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection
Listen to me
'm a British secret service agent
And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us
He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car
Has anyone ever suggested that you're a paranoid psychotic
Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel: Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold
It's on the Sea Dolphin
(boosting himself up) And thanks to your little show and tell - (straining to open the panel) - giving him the evidence - (popping it open) We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle
Blood or Dutch
He was my father's best friend
He's killed closer
You are seriously deranged
Maybe
But why are we going up instead of down
He nods to the
She looks: 60, 65, 70
Bond reaches down to her - Sidney, come with me - She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain: Not if my life depended on it
70TH  -- Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction
The elevator doors  behind her
To the right, she sees  and a Harmsway-blazered , with
Thank God
He's crazy
Does he have a gun
No
On Stamper's reply - Good - He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her
She struggles, yelling: This is a mistake
(gun against her skull) Shut up
Using Sidney as a  , Stamper marches her in front of the closed elevator doors
The guard follows Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his : (into radio) Open 14

The men unleash a   , then realize - - (

Stamper perplexed
Pushing Sidney in front of him, he enters the elevator, cautiously
When, suddenly: (like an athlete on a high- bar)   - barely clearing Sidney's head as he  Stamper and the Guard in their faces
They go flying backwards
Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney - Need a lift
And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up
-    - () - Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as - - Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and - Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to as      behind them
With his free hand, Bond reaches up for the  to open the door above them

Moves to the rear of the cab, under the escape panel

Sees nothing
Turns to the Guard: Help me up
- Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have disappeared into - - ( ) - 71ST
Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of , waiting for the elevator

As Bond and Sidney scamper off - -    - (rushing out) The stairs

They're not to leave this building alive

This has got to be a mistake
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator
At the corner, Bond ,   , farther down the hall (his back to them)
Wait here
No

Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue
They start doing a "  " in and out of doorways

Handing her the gun: Aim that way
Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, She jumps,
Bond looks at her from the - , where he is the
He offers a simple piece of advice: Shoot back
Sidney frowns

And as she    , we cut to: - (      ) - Stamper, running up steps with the guard
They exit into: - 71ST

In-between shots: How did you get into marine salvage
(gun burst, then) My father left me the business
Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb
The guards shoot; she shoots back, then explains: used to be a divorce lawyer in New York City
Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch
Glances at her: Not a lot of difference
What do you mean
Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can - Either way, you're taking the goods from dead hulks
He tosses the can, and   , covering her

- Let's go - Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when - -      -  - Stamper and the  have arrived at the corner,
- Damn
Swiftly, Bond grabs a  of  from under the sink, moves to the door, and      in Stamper's direction
- ( ) - Anticipate a bomb
They move back
(
) - What the hell does that do
Cleans dirt
Let's go
- Bond and Sidney  for the
(Where the first Guards were shooting at them from
)  , Bond lets a  go in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead guards' -l0's
- '
- - Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up
Then realizes: It's a trick
After him
(into his radio, on the run) They're in the south stairwell
,     - Get more men up there
-  - Down
Bond leans over the railing
Sees  coming
Up
They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees  descending
Down
(shoots, then) Up
Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a  , just as - - Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door
- Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor: And so much for that
(into radio) They're on the 72nd floor set-back
(explains to the guards) Nowhere to go
72ND  -   -  - It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback
Bond sees a  '
And although Sidney asks - Now what
Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them
Amidst a pile of  , he spots a
He grabs it, and - He fires 3  through the door into the frame
That should buy us some time
Now, Bond moves to the  '  - a two-man bucket-like scaffold  , with     inside, and a / that stays on the roof
Approaching it, Bond looks over the side: '  -    72ND  - Twenty stories below is the sky bridge
50 stories below that, the ground
It's a long, long, way down
-    '  -  - - Help me move this
- Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door
He tries to open it
Won't budge
'll call for a battering ram - No
Get the fire ax
One of the guards grabs it from inside a
He hands the to Stamper, who takes the first
-  - -
72ND  -  - Bond is positioning the window washer rig
He explains: We'll go down close to the sky bridge
We may be able to swing over and use it for cover
As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side
No way
sail
do not fly
Behind them, Stamper's
Sometimes, you just have to take the plunge
Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts down, as fast as they can go
-  - Bond and Sidney descend
Tiny specs against the sunset
- Stamper gives the last few chops to the door
He kicks it open
- - 72ND  - Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge
-     - 60TH  - Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress
All  know is one thing: If we get out of here alive, that gold is mine
(beat) 've earned it
Looking upward, Bond   peering over the rail
One thing at a time
- -  - Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged
Ax in hand, he moves to the   '  - And takes a roundhouse swing at the   - but instead of cutting it, the ax  , and the
- ( ) - Swings
Sidney  - almost falling out
Bond grabs her
They are now 5      , swaying like a giant pendulum - although still descending
-  - - 72ND  -  - Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the  feeding it
He swings
Swings again
With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens
- ( ' ) - Dropping in   - just trying to stay in the damn bucket
-    - Finally, the pulley shaft
- are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge
(panicked, anxious, fast) What now
And don't give me some movie cliche like 'trust me
' (what the hell) Trust me
And with this, he turns, and   the adjacent
Let's go - But as he starts to climb out - 10  ,
- - Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum
It's coming loose from its moorings
- look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what (she thinks) is certain death: We're going to bounce off that thing
Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper cuts the cable
: Hold on
- - 72ND  -  - Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum
With a  - it     , smashes into the wall, and the whole mechanism
'  - Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way
They start to free-fall
-     at the glass top of the sky bridge
- ,  - 50TH    - Landing on the deck of the bridge
Bond rolls to his feet as - Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck
Bond yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as   , ,          -
72ND   - - Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio
(over radio) They're on the bridge
Seal off the 50th floor
- (looking at the monitors) should have hired this man
(to his guards) Get somebody up there
-  - Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris
What about the elevators
He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four inch pipe
Bond begins to work feverishly: We tried that already
Remember
Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses
You know, this is as much your fault as it is mine
Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe
One loop
Sidney, we don't have time for this - He pulls on the loop to test it
Good enough
Makes a second loop
Sure
Just when  want to talk - (beat) Not that  would have believed you - Bond tests the second loop
He's satisfied
Turns to her: Put your back to the railing
Sit up on it
(doing it) Are you listening to me
Put your arms around my neck
Lock your legs around my waist
We have time for that
Just then,
Running, as - : Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's rig, and is descending,
Bond looks at Sidney - Sometimes you just have to - Don't say it
She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire
- Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up
They go down, And down, And down - - (
) - The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the , and the  itself is from the friction
-  - Dropping - And Dropping
Looking to the ground, Bond sees the coming up fast from below
It looks like they're going to get splattered on the tile floor, when - -   - The cable comes to the end of its run
It   , , and all the other  to the side of the bridge, ,
-  - Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt
They're swinging about five feet from the balcony
There's a pause
Is this - like - a normal day for you
It's a lousy job, but - (reaching for the balcony) The only reason  stay is for the health benefits
Bond
-  - Stamper lands on bridge
He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing, looks down and sees    climbing out onto the balcony, going for the
(into his radio) They're heading for the press room
Stop them
- Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down earlier to meet Harmsway
The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening
At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond sees a     on a , about to be loaded
Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where Bond and Harmsway exited earlier
- Coming out of that , Bond sees   in Harmsway Blazers carrying guns
shoots the  on the
It    , rolling backwards on the guards
As they start scrambling around it - Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc- tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage
) They encounter a - , with an oversized crowbar
Bond and the Pressman square off
Bond tries to get around him
The man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it
Bond tries to block the descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half
Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing each other against the side of the press
Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and pushes the man back, into a pile of
Momentarily stunned, Bond forces the man's head into an    - And as he comes up,   , gasping for air, Sidney bops him on the head with the crowbar
Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit - But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond
Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard as he comes to finish Bond off
The Guard stumbles backward - Crashing against a
( large machine that wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery
) Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to  the - literally tying the man up
The only problem is that as Bond turns - The   has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond
Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) - Bond rushes the man,       , pulling Sidney away at the last moment
The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and
The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn
He was bad news
Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney and the gun, and runs to the
Down there
They jump into it, sliding down, and around an   into: -
Bond and Sidney come out near a  stacked with newspapers
Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise - they're ready for almost anything, except what they : The
polite, almost bored clapping
(
) Vert, very, good Mr
Bond
Outstanding performance
Harmsway is standing with  , shoulder to shoulder, in a straight line, all   on Sidney and Bond
(continuing) 'm the certain the British taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts
Don't you agree
think they'd rather know who stole their gold
Harmsway can't help his ego: (chuckles) Why,  did, of course
It's on the Sea Dolphin , twenty miles outside of Hong Kong
Not that it will do either of you any good to know
(beat) Now both of you: Stand up
And toss the gun out, Mr
Bond
Bond    several feet in front of him
And , noting
Bond begins to scheme
Uncle Elliot: How could you do this to me
Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket
Oh, please, Sidney
There's a hundred billion dollars at stake
(beat) Besides,  never really liked your father that much
He cheated at cards
Bond has removed the
He palms it
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl
My guards are from South Africa, Mr
Bond
This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain
(beat) Now both of you
Put your hands on your heads, and step forward
Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head
He's manipulating the control into the right position to use it
(trying to buy time) What did you do, Harmsway
Make some deal with the Chinese government for the gold
Was the radioactive uranium  found in Venice part of it
He finally has the remote control in the right position
Questions, questions, Mr
Bond
Which 'm afraid 've neither the time, nor the inclination to answer

The  , in shock   , as: retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the newspaper trolley, while - , sending the guards scrambling

007 begins shooting, as - Kill it
Shoot the damn thing - They manage to shoot out the headlights, while - is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time
As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them - Here
You shoot
'll drive
You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship
Another reason
Did  miss something
(taking the gun) You insist on calling all the shots
(beat) And by the way:  am not a helpless girl
Bond eyes her for one split second
Points at the guards: Aim that way
Sidney starts to shoot as - continue to blast away at the car
But: '

There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as , where the door opens automatically

Shall we kill them

In fact, Mr
Bond may have actually improved my original plan
(beat) Bring them both to Hong Kong
And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve
: -   -  - It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk; where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256
While the captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones
At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the  : Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to: 5"    - With one important difference: There's an  logo in lower corner
() As part of our continuing report on terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant

,  , ) - Two   are shooting an    interviewing a middle-aged
We don't see the reporter's face; from the "over the shoulder" news angle, he's
(There's also     on the ground, and a seemingly empty   moored to a nearby pier
) (cont'd) - Interviewing Mr
David Chin, senior engineer in charge of security
(beat) Tell me, Mr
Chin: How safe is this plant from a terrorist attack
He holds out a  to Chin
Totally secure
Without codes, you'd need a missile to blast through the front door; you normally can't even get this close (to the plant) without a full security clearance
Could you say that a little closer to the microphone
He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face: Of course
You'd need - Suddenly,
And The  reporter    : '
(to the guards) Now
At once, the two cameramen turn: One  his shoulder-mounted video camera at a  ; the other aims at the
shoot out from their lenses, destroying both
Let's go
As Yung and the cameramen rush forward - - Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box of equipment
He calls back to   who have appeared on deck: Get the machine in the water
They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold
(This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top, and no flexible tubing attached
) / -   - Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area: What happened out there
generator blew
Nothing to worry about
(beat) But  need one last shot of you
Why don't you stand by the alarm
No problem
The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera
And Yung pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him
(to the cameramen) Up the stairs
They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control room
Meanwhile, back at the  boat: - Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way out
He hears the door click open, and - Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on top
Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney
Put on your clothes
(to the guard) Cuff him
The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to: - Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con- soles, with a window overlooking the  , and its surrounding blue
(to the half-dozen engineers) 'm sorry to interrupt again
But we need one more picture for the story
The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure
" "Okay
" Yung smiles: (') Why don't you line up against the wall
Let's make it a group shot
The engineers line up against a wall
The cameramen take positions for a massacre
And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to: - Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs
Sleep well
Next time,  do the driving
Bond gives her a look
- Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the   of a portable version of the "worm" controller we saw on the
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel
Excellent
Harmsway looks up, hearing: see you're in your natural element, Harmsway:  room filled with lethal power
(beat) With a toxic core at its center
Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at gun point,) with Stamper and a guard
Harmsway is charming as ever: Do come in Mr
Bond, Sidney
You're just in time for a nuclear meltdown
Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him - You bastard - Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage
He sees a   on the console
Please, Sidney
'd like to remember you fondly
(calling from the console) Approaching the first gate
Start the grinders
-     - The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars
- So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for
Precisely, Mr
Bond
In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor
(beat) And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium - - Instant melt-down
Chernobyl will look like a campfire
Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency
Bond decides to try rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed
We're through the first gate
Approaching the second - (demanding) Why, Harmsway
Wasn't stealing the gold enough
(to Yung) Bore through
(to Bond, chuckling) They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr
Bond
(beat) They're wrong
(beat) Revenge is the best revenge
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target - (fiercely) What could you possibly have to be vengeful for, Harmsway
Still trying to prove yourself to daddy
This infuriates Harmsway
Bond moves closer to the gun
Hong Kong, Mr
Bond
You have to leave - (enraged, ignoring Yung) hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization
(beat) And now that 'm being forced to give it back,  intend to return it in exactly the same condition: barren, lifeless rock
(beat) The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen
(to Sidney, glancing at the gun) think Uncle Elliot is having his own melt-down
Approaching the third gate - Smash through it
(then) Laugh all you'd like, Mr
Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans
(he reaches for a newspaper) Here
This just in
Newsflash
Read all about it
He thrusts an issue of  at Bond, holding the top half out as Bond reads  , sourly: Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown
British agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway calls for British government to resign
Harmsway smiles at Bond: As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies
What about the gold
You must go
Now
Otherwise the boat won't be out of range - Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave - Thirty seconds
(then, to Bond) That's the most brilliant part of the plan, Mr
Bond: To save the economy, 'll let the new British government - my British government - announce that the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years
(beat) And just by coincidence: He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline: Gold mine opens in Vietnam
(turns to Stamper) Let's go
Put them in the airlock
Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney
Bond edges closer to the gun
You'll never get away with it, Harmsway
Too many people know
Bond tenses, ready to spring - Who, Mr
Bond
The kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists
The Oliver Stones of the world
(pausing, then, with great scorn:) 'll publish their books, 'll make their movies, 'll put them on my shows
(beat) They're my bellboys
They carry my luggage
Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun
Bond frowns
Now
Get them in the airlock
Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan
As Stamper hustles them off - One problem, Harmsway: The girl
And the handcuffs
They'll give it away
Harmsway considers this for a second
Sidney takes Bond's arm
No
want to stay with him
Bond looks at her
He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he realizes he's developed feelings for her
He knows that if he could hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"
But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone
(breaking the moment, cynically) How sweet
(satto, to Bond) My timing always was lousy
(cold and hard) 'd rather die alone
Take the girl
Leave the handcuffs
We'll drown her at sea
(to Bond, sarcastically) Enjoy the rest of your life
As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears: 'll meet you on the boat, south of Lantau Island
- The door closes
Bond looks out the small window at: - Take the men
can finish alone
(to the technicians and cameramen) You come with me - (to the guard who handcuffed Bond) You stay here
As they exit - - Bond has yanked his shoes off
He pulls out the and opens the     , revealing a , and
Moving quickly, Bond   a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while
- Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard: We'll cut through the last gate, then set it on auto-pilot
He starts to maneuver the joystick, and - -   - The worm turns a corner
We see - '  - (
) - 100 feet ahead: An iron gate
Beyond it, the blue lights from the reactor cooling pool
And beyond that
, a shimmering silver target
Meanwhile, back outside, at - - Water sprays violently as the  boat thunders out of Aberdeen harbor with Harmsway at the helm
Junks and sampans are tossed in his wake, as - Bond finishes pressing the
Then that's been hidden inside
He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the detonator, then steals a glance out the window at: - still guiding the worm with the joy stick
His eyes are focused on: (  ,  ' ) - Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen
He presses a nearby button marked " "
And the video goes black, replaced by the words "
" -( ) - The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed
Meanwhile - - Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and - - a small  from inside the airlock
(to the guard) Check it out
Be careful
The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door
- Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to the plastique explosive around the door handle
-,  - ( ) The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars
- And suddenly
The door blows open with a shattering blast
-    - The guard is blasted backward, dead
Bond rolls out, scrambling for the weapon
Yung slams his hand on a button marked "-
" caption appears on the video screen " ," and - As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of him
They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards the window overlooking the blue cooling pool
Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun
Yung takes a shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as - ( -  ) - Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole toward    , 35 feet ahead
- have squared off in a short, brutal   battle
(The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them
) They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own, Yung is every bit his equal
Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick - But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing against a wall near a
Meanwhile, all through this
- As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher from the wall
He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2
In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun
Then  at Bond, headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007 Bond is winded
And as he struggles to stop himself from falling backwards into the reactor room
Yung does a ,    to finish the job - But at the last second,  , reaches up, and uses Yung's momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into - He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as - ,      ,  - ( ) - - Bond races to hit the "   " button
He pulls a  , disconnects the worm, and sets off an " " system, spraying the room with a mist of water
Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at: (' ) - There's a cloud of  in the middle of the blue water
- Bond goes to the dead guard
Gets the key, removes his handcuff bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits
- (
) - With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off
- ( -   ) - The  boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin
The gang from the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat
(Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open, hanging from a steel boom
) - Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain
Any news
The call just went out on the Hong Kong police radio: Fire at the power plant
(ironically) Alert the media
Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck
What do you want me to do with her
- Can't we make a deal
won't say anything - (touching her cheek) You're so cute, my dear
(beat) But 'm afraid not
(to one of the cameramen) Put her in the storage room
The cameraman takes her away
Harmsway turns to the captain: (') We'll get rid of her when we're in International waters
(then) Set sail, full speed, due south
'll be in my cabin
Let me know when Mr
Yung arrives
We'll break out the champagne
/  -    - Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,) the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and He pushes Sidney inside
Don't get any ideas
Then locks the door on her
'   -  - Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an island in the distance
-  - Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course
The '  - The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead
Bond sees then passes over - the  boat, bobbing empty in the water
Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin , shimmering in the instance
-    - Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the helicopter - a tiny speck in the air
There it is
Stamper lifts a pair of  for confirmation
'  -    - He sees two figures in the cockpit
- Stamper picks up his radio: It's him
They both made it
- The Captain replies: 'll tell Sir Elliot
'  - Harmsway is working at a computer
chime sounds
Yes
' He's approaching from the north, sir
Fantastic
Invite the crew on deck to celebrate, and 'll be up in a few minutes
-  -  - Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin
Maybe 500' in the air
Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees
Ahead, he sees: '  -  -    - The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the ship's railings
- Ready for war
He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent
/ Champagne bottles pop
Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at the chopper, about 1000' off the stern: He seems to be coming in awfully fast
Stamper picks up his binoculars
'  -    - He sees Bond
- Get the guns
It's not him
It's Bond
He might have also added "It's too late," as - -     / - Bond    on the port side of the boat,    from the pilot's window, and using the '  to threaten the men on deck
About half of them      , only to be quickly left behind
Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes - '  - The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by
Perplexed, Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains
He cranes his neck, but sees nothing
He presses an intercom button: What the hell is going on
- (on a phone) don't know sir - The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him
Shooting from the pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows - And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides to the deck
'  - The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a wall

The two cameramen take their -16's and rush forward, jumping up on some machinery to climb onto - - They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond

Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for them

- Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat
But he doesn't see - - (/) from the boat
Stamper is holding a shoulder mounted launcher
- It hits the engine
- The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk
The entire cockpit is chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control
- is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat continues to veer out of control
He pauses to look up at: ,   - - Bond forces the cyclic forward
The helicopter pitches forward - '  - (
) He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold
Whoever is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way
- Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio: What the hell is going on
(
) It's Bond
Kill him
Finish it
(
-) - With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches: / With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely under control - Bond opens the door
He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as - onto the gold hold, in a     and twisted metal
- Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion
- Harmsway regains control of the boat; he    from the dead captain, and pushes the body out
- With   still falling around him, Bond is stealthily moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship
(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive
) Arriving at a  , Bond checks both directions down the passageway, then pokes his head inside - And is   ,    , thrown against a railing
Bond looks up: stands with a smile on his face
One arm is raised above his head, grasping the  on the swinging boom
The worm is attached to the boom by a thin metal cable
You're mine now
Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him
The man doesn't flinch
With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him against a steel wall
Bond crashes to the deck
As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a   on a wall, and   comes to life
Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm
Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond against the wall with his free hand as he - '
With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose - 'm going to do this slowly - Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles
Stamper tumbles sideways
Bond rolls away from the worm - But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is rushing at Bond full force, with the worm
Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once
Bond ducks
The worm chews into the wall
Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond
-     / - With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in the cable, on the ground
- Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in the groin
Stamper doubles over in pain - And the worm     , swinging on the boom - The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull
- (
) - Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall
- (
) - (barking into the radio) Stamper
Report in
/ - As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick - ' (continuing, on Stamper's radio) Report to the bridge
rushes to      , which is rapidly growing taught as the worm wends its way underwater
Stamper rushes Bond - And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around Stamper's neck
Suddenly   , and - soars 15 in the air,    , as - - torrent of water floods in, pushing Sidney off to one side
'  -
- It's zooming at the door
- The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway
- The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a wall, cutting his head
- As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge, using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper: First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof
- Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the rising water and the ceiling
- 3/4 filled with water
Rising fast
'  - (,
) The worm is heading for a door
We see the door disintegrate in front of us, as the worm bursts into - With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "
" - The boat is sinking
Bond is running across the bridge roof, when: - Harmsway is thrown backwards
Gun in hand, he makes his way up the incline, to the port-side door
Just when he thinks he's made it - Bang
Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof on the small exterior walkway
He's seething with rage
Harmsway looks up at him
Blinks in disbelief
never believe what  read in the newspapers
Harmsway slowly brings up the gun
Pity you'll miss your obituary
Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt
Moves closer
Where is she, Harmsway
The fuel tanks explode in the distance
The bridge rocks violently; the room tilts to a greater angle
You want to kill me, Bond
Go ahead
With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward against the starboard wall
The water is rising on the bridge
(moving in on him) Where is she Harmsway
- He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first
Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges: What is it, Bond
You haven't the guts
Boom
There's another explosion in the background
The front of the boat tilts upward
The water is rushing in
Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder - You spineless paper tiger - And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards against the rear wall of the bridge
Where is she, Harmsway
Or did you kill her like Paris
Suddenly,
The loses his balance,    - (glaring, insanely:) We all go down together
Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat - - Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then punches him
Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth
He frantically tries to break free for the surface - But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on Harmsway's shoulders
Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at Bond in a haze of bubbles
Then falls still
With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up - - (/) - through the bridge windows, up to - He breaks through the water, gasping for air
And then, almost instantly, dives down again
- (/) - Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could just grab it, and stop it from sinking
He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away, just beyond his reach
And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his breath a second longer - (mask and tank)
Bond turns in disbelief
Stares into the mask: '
She puts her regulator in Bond's mouth
And they share the air as they rise from the depths
- They break through the water
Sidney yanks off her mask
Teases: What do you mean, you'd rather die alone
didn't say when  want to die - She splashes him
Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache' dinghy floating nearby
-   - Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in
They collapse in the bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale
After a beat,
Bond is already amused: Yes
Before we go any further here, Mr
Bond, from Lloyds of London,  just want to get two things straight
Yes
First, that boat is in international waters
'm claiming it for salvage
One-third of that gold is mine
And number two
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear: (pause) We're going to have it where  want, and when  want
And when might that be
Now
He laughs
She falls into his arms
They kiss, and we cut to: - With the dinghy reflected in the glass
In unison, they are both lowered, revealing  and Wade
As usual,  see the situation is in 007's very capable hands
Life is not fair
(emphatically) You're right
British naval officer appears
Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the message went to London
Thank you
and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off: Tell me, -ster
You do ever do any gardening
The only thing  ever planted was bugs
- On the wall behind 's
It's night
Moneypenny sits across from , with a steno pad
Moneypenny, take the following release: (beat) The body of Sir Elliot Harmsway was found floating in the South China Sea this morning, at 08:00 hours local Hong Kong time
(pauses) At present, local authorities believe the media mogul committed suicide
- Bond and Sidney break off a kiss
She lies nestled in his arms
James
Is this really what a typical day is like for you
Bond replies with a wry smile: Yes
(pause) But some days
Are longer than others
And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the two of them
And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal: The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the compass
(save for one last line:) James Bond will return
