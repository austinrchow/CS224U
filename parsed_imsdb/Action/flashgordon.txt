: - At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an endless savanna from horizon to horizon
We hear savage drums beating in the distance coming from some unknown place
The sun clears the horizon
Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible From it shoots a

- 's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline
It buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds
- There are just two passengers in the cabin
One is  , a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled " Guide to Survival In The City
"  few rows forward, near the open door into the pilots' compartment, is
He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed things with 's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows indicating the directions of movement
Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump
It almost knocks the book from ' hand
She looks out the window with sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture that's habitual to her in moments of stress
There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds
She looks forward again and watches  standing up easily, leaning in t

Clear-air turbulence, is all
Nothing - But nothing you'd want to toss a third-down pass through either -- (Grinning back at ) Can  have an autograph for my kid, Mr
Gordon
Sure -- my pleasure
As  takes a bit of paper from the -, the plane takes another jolt, even more violent than the first
Wow
Call Westchester Approach, see what they've got
sure hope we don't have to turn back

starts back to his seat
The plane jumps again, shudders violently
He holds on, calls up front: Maybe it'd be smoother if you went -- Will you
(as 's head ) Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have their hands full -- just let 'em drive
- (, ) The plane buffets
is sent reeling, catches hold of the rack above , lowers himself into the seat next to her
He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it to her

When you're nervous, it can help to chew on something Thanks a lot --  look dumb enough to take candy from a stranger
'm not a stranger exactly -- You know my name
Who doesn't
Number one draft pick, cover of  mag -- what'd the sign you for, eighty-nine million
Big deal
Of course
God,  hate flying -- 'm Dale Arden it's crazy of me to hate flying -- 'm a travel agent, you see
-- 've just been checking out a little hotel in Vermont -- can  still have that candy bar
(and in the same breath) Are we going backward
Backwards
() Holy cow
Look at the clouds
-     - The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to surround the airplane
Over the engines we  that same ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening
Slowly and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning
The clouds race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past the plane from behind
- and  -- faces bathed in the eerie light
Speechless- grasps the football player's hand with all her strength
- It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous isolation in a pretty country landscape
The sun has turned 4
the    we saw from the airplane, and clouds race across it with unnatural velocity
In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower through which we glimpse something
Floating high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium- filled balloons, secured by wires
As we move closer, we discern a  moving about actively on a platform inside the central tower, about half-way up: - (,  , ) The man is
: big, bearded, feverish looking and seemingly half mad with exhaustion
In striking contrast to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash fashion
Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view
As Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a grim-voiced
is appearing and speaking from a good-sized television screen above the main control console: The extraordinary weather disturbances reported from Africa this morning are now crossing the Atlantic, and are expected to reach the East Coast of the United States by noon
According to scientists at , the Earth is being struck by an immense stream of cosmic energy, apparently the result of some catastrophic stellar accident beyond the reaches -- whirls, slams the    and yells at the silently mouthing  on the screen

Yes, sir -- you sure did
And this funny sun too --- Ozone layer starting to crack up

Stunned,  turns his head and glances at something big and   gleaming behind foliage in center of tower
You're crazy
Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes, pulls out a revolver and points it at

They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe

The directional needles are going crazy

On the left, about six o'clock high

From the cortex -like bolts of shoot out

Wind from the shattered windows assaults  as he charges in
He stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive
Recovering he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals
lurches in against the tornado
Can you fly it

Oh boy
Ever hear about the man who fell ninety stories from a window and didn't break a bone
No but 'd sure like to
How'd The man fall ninety stories didn't break a bone
The window was ninety-one stories up
- The Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting
We get a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a flat area

Of course --  admit that

Haven't you any spirit at all
Goodbye, Doctor -- they were all right about you

If you won't come, who will  find
If you woo't come, who will  find: ignores him totally, keeps walking away
lifts his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back
Just as he is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside
Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough landing in the field outside
The plane hits on one wheel, bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on rolling toward the greenhouse
- the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting to run
He hardly gets five yards before the Twin Otter comes through the greenhouse wall, burying totally under the wreckage

Dazed, blood on his forehead,  struggles from his seat

Are you all right

There are some controls and displays, but in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed from conventional spacecraft as 's solitary genius is from everyday science

Gladly

Instantly the   pulls his sword, rips open his breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and on to the fatal point
With a little cry of horror,  shrinks back into ' arms
You inhuman fiend
Of course 'm "inhuman"

(Dropping his voice) Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering if you are alone in the universe -- beaming you plaintive messages into to the void for anything that might hear you -- even hurling your bodies out into it -- and all without the faintest inkling of who or what is out here

For the moment -- not for much longer
But why
What in hell have we ever done to hurt you
You exist -- and yet you pay no homage to Ming
What greater crime can be committed

Inside the cube a recognisable greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph, slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view below a veil of clouds

The fires recede
The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed

It only requires myself and one woman
