Michael Straczynski 2nd    6/4/08 : a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into flesh
The ink is needled into the surface of the skin, raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the precision of ritual
The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon
The image has beauty but retains the violence required to saturate flesh with art
The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle- work
Fuck
Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck

-                                       1 place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying towels, tea and cigarettes
Dozens of Yakuza look on as the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos
, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first tattoo, a relatively small one on his back
He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby
Watch it, old man
The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush
Maybe a little harder
(') What the fuck
You're doing it wrong
The needle is doing what the needle does
What's that supposed to mean

If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited
What did you just say, old man
Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old man's jaw
(') know you didn't just disrespect me, did you
You that fucking stupid
You disrespect me, and 'll tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains
The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through years of service to men like Hollywood
No disrespect
Hollywood smiles
You're lucky
can't kill you 'til you finish this thing
Gimme that mirror
How's it looking
Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus
Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror
He whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an origami envelope

Not bad
For an old fuck
Hey, boss
This just came for you

So open it, dumb ass
He opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he sees
(') What
What is it
He pours the contents out into his hand
Looks like sand
He tastes it
(') Yup
Sand
Black Sand
The tattoo master drops his brush
It clatters to the floor
No
You know what this is
The artist barely nods
(') Wanna let us in on the joke
Years ago,  watched a man open an envelope like that one
His eyes pool with fury at the memory
(') There were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now
Then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood
You cannot bargain with what is coming
You cannot reason with it
Because it is not a human being
It is a demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are dead

cannot say the word
What word
He pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump of scar tissue at the center of his heart
That night, one of their blades struck here
should have died, but for an accident of birth
My heart is here, on the other side
Hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon
What the fuck is that
Looks like a Ninja, boss
ninja
Are you kidding me
That's the word you're afraid to say
Ninja
As he starts to laugh
(') Ninja-Ninja-Ninja
His laughter is infectious
(') You old fuck
You had me going
Ninja
That's some good shit
His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his tongue wagging in space
Lights shatter around the room
Chaos ensues
The panicked screams of the fleeing entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are eviscerated

The whistle of swords through the air
Cries and screams
Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled
on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window
Frozen
Immobile
As the killing continues around him
Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate , and a  being struck by Hollywood who looks up -- -- and sees a dark figures standing before him
Everyone else is dead
Only he and the Tattoo Master remain
The figure regards him with still silence
For perhaps the first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified
(') Listen
you don't have to do this
Whatever you're getting paid, 'll triple it
You hear me
'll pay you whatever you want
Just name your price
Their answer is silence
Hollywood sees his guns nearby
With a desperate scream, he  the match in the air as he  for his guns, grabbing one in each hand
There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed hands are tumbling gracefully through the air
The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it were barely there, coming out the other side as -- -- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces, splattering the artist with blood
The match touches the floor and goes out
The Tattoo Master does not move, has not moved
Frozen
But you are real, aren't you
After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the dark to inspect its kill
The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart pounding in his ears
(') For fifty-seven-years, 've told your story

The ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless
He crouches down, his eyes taking in the old man's tattoo
(') But you are real, aren't you
There's the shing of a sword being unsheathed
The artist closes his eyes, anticipating death
Silence
He waits for the death blow
It does not come
He finally forces himself to open his eyes
The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he came, leaving death and blood in his wake

've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki
The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about
The question was never brought up again
But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda

The floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern

This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor

Then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches
Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod
Slashing blows that leave deep cuts

Kiriko looks on from her mat for a long, silent , knowing the agony he is in
Then, as if coming to an inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into which a thick salve has been folded
She crosses the few feet to Raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony, she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down -- -- and begins applying the salve to his feet
Within moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes
Finishing quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with Raizo, then heads back for her mat
He lays there for a , confused as to whether his diminishing pain is a good thing
Then he turns to look at Kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently asleep
He regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over himself to sleep as we come around to -- -- the other side of Kiriko, and see that she is very much awake, almost smiling

The bulb rattles, it's just burned out
She breathes a sigh of relief

Looks to her desk, concerned
Did she leave the window open
Or is something going on
She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something
She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax
Pulls out the tampax to reveal a key

Relieved, she starts to put it away

She moves
the  is switched on, and an image begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera, recording an urban street corner in Japan
The tape is riddled with digital noise and artifacting
Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to grow shapes
The shadows come to life
Then with incredible speed two dark figures start battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are still descending after they've slipped back into the shadows
They emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the wing of a bird

Armed with katanas, the boys duck, dodge and weave around the burning obstacles as they fight
They are both extremely agile, their bodies moving with the impossible flexibility of youth
Kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan
If she feels anything as she watches the fight, we cannot tell
They perform a vicious series of combinations, then Takeshi's sword cracks against Raizo's head, opening a huge gash
Raizo hits the ground hard, blood speckling the mats
Takeshi backs away as Ozunu steps in
As blood flows down the side of his face, Raizo looks like the young boy that he is
Pain throbs from the wound, and he begins to cry
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you
You                   * think this is pain
You are                           * mistaken

Kiriko is the last to turn away
: Later

Raizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain, his face stained with tears and crusted with snot
He is trying to control his breath, at first without success
Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease
His hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins to relax, opening like a lotus flower
: Dawn breaks over the wall, as Ozunu returns to the dojo to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus, completely calm, the wound already beginning to heal
Ozunu shows a hint of a smile

He takes his position again, and this time the stance is easy, his expression softer

Trying to sleep, but it's impossible
Takeshi's snoring doesn't help
He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea-water in a tidal pool
He begins to breathe in sync with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him
Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until only her breathing, and his, remains
There is the slight murmur of their hearts
Then she opens her eyes
and smiles at him because he cannot see her
But he hears her heart begin to beat faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips
They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier, the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster
Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement
tilting her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against the blanket- It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo

It sits on her desk, calling as another box once called to Pandora
She opens it
Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta
The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and several sketches

Images of the orphanage, of the children training and their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings on the Nightingale floor
There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage tree of the Nine Clans
Also in the box is a single  tape
She pushes the tape into the player
It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the front of the Sabatin house
man walks up to the house and rings's the bell
We cannot see his face
Sabatin opens the door
They exchange words
Sabatin seems wary but invites the man in
Mika doesn't understand why this is significant
She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man exits
She stops, rewinds and plays it again
* As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his face- It is Raizo
She is startled when someone pounds on the door
It seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries to open it revealing- Maslow and he's not happy

She shifts nervously, no poker face
She turns and leads him into her home office
With the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer
Maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of Sabatin's box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence
Most of this is from Sabatin
Copies of what  think are the lost chapters of the Rihle think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty

It could be a clan war
Maslow starts to put it together

Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating outside
Mika approaches a
Hey
Hi
What happened
Power's out
Us, the building behind us, that one across the street
Seems like every few months, boom, the lights out call,  complain, they listen
nothing gets done
So sit out here, at least it's cool
Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything
She pulls a tiny  flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building

Shadows chase each other across the room as she swings the light one way, then another
There seems to be no one else in the place
But as she hurries into her home office, we see -- shadow move behind her
As she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping
The same sound she heard before
She pulls the gun from her purse
With the flashlight spearing the darkness, she goes to her office
Again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing against the sash
She is certain the window had been locked
Now every shadow is alive
She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction
Her flashlight finds her suitcase
On the top of her clothes she sees it: An envelope
Perfectly centered
Setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami-folded envelope
Opens it with a shaking finger
Black sand spills out
Terror steals her breath
Behind her, a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja
Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the darkness, heading for her neck- () 2nd     6/4/08   48

The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness
Her flashlight catches glimpses
Impossibly fast, lethal predators trying to kill each other
She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase, towards the gun
Another blow arcs for her and is again blocked
Her hand finds the handle of the gun
She points into the dark, fires
The gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas in the blink of a flashbulb
They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying
She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep- Blood erupts
One shadow falls to the ground
The other turns towards her
Her flashlight shakes as the ninja reaches up and removes his mask
It is Raizo
He sees in her eyes that she knows him
You know me

Their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment, his dark eyes flashing that we recognize
Like snap-focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the fight: the bullets in the wall, footprints, and shattered lights
One of the killers uses his sword to trace the line of a slashing cut in wall

He considers her
Raizo
is the name  was given
So, you were an orphan
His head nods slightly
(') Interesting nature verses nurture case study  imagine
He cocks an eyebrow
(') If it's okay with you, 'll try to fill in some of the blanks
You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program
don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way
But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin
Which figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know
He looks at her impressed
(') Yeah,  got some moves too
'm pretty lethal with the research thing
He almost smiles

Ninja only kill two kinds of people
The first kind has power and money
The other kind is trying to stop them
He nods, noticing shops out beyond the exit
(') Exit here

You are a size 36
What
No
Size 34

He starts to leave then stops- If you leave while  am gone they will catch you and kill you
He looks her in the eye
(') Do you understand that
She nods
He opens his door and slips out

He passes into the shadow of the building and disappears
She digs into her bag for the phone Maslow gave her
She : 911
But situ stable
Guardian angel all in black

Will call She hits send
Looks out to the darkness surrounding her
After a moment one of the shadows comes to life
The door opens and Raizo gets in, his arm full of clothes
(') We need a hotel

Get undressed
Shower
Do not use the hotel soap
Or any towel
Do you smoke
No
He nods
Put your clothes in here
He pulls the garbage bag from the wastepaper basket
Then leaves as she begins getting undressed
73

Don't you know how to knock
'm trying to save your life
okay right
He hands her the tree branch
Dry yourself with this
He starts taking off his clothes
He does it quickly without any sense of awkwardness; the world where he came from makes little distinction between male and female
She's not from the same world, keeping herself as covered as possible with a tree branch
He jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself off
'm just a researcher
'm really not equipped to deal with this
He steps out and quickly wipes the dripping water off his body with the branch
Get dressed
In the bedroom, Raizo is dressed in new clothes
He lights a cigarette as Mika come out struggling with the tightness of her new jeans
These are a little tight
You said 34
European sizes

(') This is for my "scent"
He nods
Let's go
75
-                        75 as he picks the lock of a different car trunk
Wow
They teach you that at ninja school
Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of
The trunk pops open
Raizo tosses their bag of clothes under the lid of the tire compartment
Then closes the door
He leads her down the parking lot sizing up the cars, until he finds one he likes
You're going to steal a car
Just borrow it
The door opens
(') Get in
She sighs
In for a penny, in for a pounding

The device finds the right frequency to start the car

No
Twenty heavily armed men emerge from the wall of light
Hands on your head
On your knees
Do it now
Raizo
No
This is wrong

What are you doing
Following orders
The men swarm over him, binding him with brutal efficiency, hauling him away

-                79 Raizo wakes up
There's a commotion on the other side of the shoji screens that comprise the inner wall of the dorm
Silhouettes limned against the paper
Raizo moves to the screens
Pulls them a half inch aside as the other children watch
Through the tiny gap, he sees ninjas dragging Kiriko down the hall
Gagged, arms twisted with shiburi, blood streaking her pale and terrified face

Cameras stare at him

modern office shoe-horned into an abandoned building: cubicles, computers and Aeron chairs amidst crumbling walls
Maslow's team are hanging out there, thirty agents, a fairly competent and well-armed bunch
Maslow is inside the control room which is like a small construction trailer
Several different monitors have images of Raizo
Prisoner is secure sir
For a moment it appears that Raizo looks up as Maslow looks at him, as if somehow Raizo could see through the lens watching him
Then his head drops again
Right
He scans the different monitors
(') Something's wrong with the infrared cam
No sir, we checked it
Then why isn't he showing up
We think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral

Ryan, you know this is wrong
It can't be legal
What is this place
Your own private Guantanamo
It's an old  safehouse
Jamison wants this off the grid
Ryan you're making a huge mistake
don't think so
We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy
Only problem we have is where to extradite him first
So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one
We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies

You're not listening to me
You're not saying anything worth hearing

Looking at -- -- Kiriko, in the box
Dehydration has left Kiriko with barely the strength to breathe
Her lips are swollen and cracked, she sags against the tight walls of the box
He pulls a bamboo straw from his dark robe, then fills his mouth with water from a flask
Sticking the straw through the bamboo poles near her lips, he feeds her drop by drop, and in this way, separated by a cage they share a kind of kiss
Her eyes part, ever so slightly, and she manages a smile

(') Hurry the fuck up
Ka-chunk-- she punches the lock
Click-- the headlights flash on-- Ka-chick-- she chambers the Glock
(') Motherfuckfuckfuck-- She twists the ignition and as the motor turns over-- The car's headlights explode, shattered by projectiles that seem to materialize from the void
Mika screams throwing the car into gear-- Peeling out toward the down ramp
The car fishtails down level after level through the oscillating light/dark of the dimly lit exit ramp
Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead-- shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider
She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a squall of stars
The sedan rebounds into the light
Its hood and windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great White

Something lands on the roof of the car
Above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as- She passes under a light-- Revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her, through the sun roof
His blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike-- She jams the barrel of the Glock between the two tips of one set of claws, right where his foot should be-- And fires
scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over the sunroof-- The ninja's body tumbling off the back of the car
Maslow's gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of sparks as it corners into traffic
Mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell phone
: 95
-                                      95 The lights are still dead
Maslow is with a team of Europols moving through the stairwell
He talks quietly
Ryan-  had to leave
Good, stay clear
Do you have the map
Not yet
We're heading upstairs now
Where's Raizo () 2nd     6/4/08   77
95   :                                                  95 He took off
We think they went after him
He looks into the surrounding shadows unsure
96
-                                          96 Raizo parkours across the roofs, the Hanta Kirra close behind
Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open whip cuts across his flesh
97
-                         97 Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side
Drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change
He looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight
And suddenly the ninja are on him
Raizo blocks and parries
Counterattacks with a reverse cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him
The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death
Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns -- -- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder
98
-  -            98 The fight is now two one against one, and one of them is Takeshi
Their swords crash back and forth, sending sparks flying
Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken
With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to face Takeshi
Too late
Takeshi's blade gets under his guard
Opens up Raizo's side
His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away

98   :                                                   98 Raizo stumbles backward
Life's blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete
Takeshi raises his sword high
Smiles
This is the end for you, brother
Mika's car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to Raizo
The door snaps open
Raizo
Raizo gets into the car
Collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side
She peels away before the others can stop her
Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can
Eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas
Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump
His shirt is drenched with his own blood
(') What were you doing in the street
waiting for you
You have to go to a hospital
No
Not a hospital
Another place
The car speeds into the night
99
-                                           99 The sort of store where the owner lives above the shop
Mika pounds on the door as a  comes on in the floor above
moment later, the door opens
What is it
What -- He steps out of the way as Mika helps Raizo in, bloody and half-dead

-  -                      100 Herbalist places herbs into a hand-grinder as Raizo staggers through the rows of bowls, grabbing what he needs and handing it to her
dong-xia leaves
three of the lo-chan
dragon root
You should not mix these
Very dangerous
Raizo ignores him
Gives her some more dried bits and pieces
The herbalist shakes his head
(') If you are in pain
if you wish to die
there are other ways, this will be agony -- No
it will save me
It will
You're sure
(beat) Let me write this down
He goes to find a pen and paper as Mika grinds away
Hot water
She goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl
He reaches for it, and nearly collapses
She helps him raise the cup to his lips
Tilts it and watches him drink
Takes the empty cup away from him
Raizo shudders as the drugs course through him
(') have to sleep now
a day at least
His eyelids flutter
She's holding him up now - muscles already loosening

What should  do
keep moving

He pauses as he sees Mika standing over Raizo
She looks from him to Raizo and back again, then: 'll have him to go

Moving
He told me to keep moving
He's still alive
She glances at his slumped body
After a fashion
Let us bring you in

Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked

He takes a breath
negative
They got to my office
Everything's gone
The news crushes her
(') Mika, it's gonna be all right
We'll find them

She looks at him
(') 'm a forensic researcher, okay
That's like a fancy way of saying 'm a librarian

She opens her fist; inside is the tracking device Maslow gave her

Bending over him, she kisses him gently

Agent Maslow, the tracking device-- You've got a lock
Triangulating her position now

It pauses as if sensing something

They took him
Ten minutes ago
He's gone
Maslow embraces her

Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping
In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye
The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone, melting quietly into the shadows
no

Because my heart is telling me too
The Hanta Kirra will come for you
Then they will come
You know the law
He will cut your heart from your chest
She smiles
No
He can never touch my heart
She puts his hand on her chest, then leans in and kisses him
(') Come with me
Where
What is out there
Life
He cannot imagine what that life might be
My life is here
She bows her head and turns
(') Why are you doing this
Because  can't watch you become something you are not

He can sense some light filtering through the edges and air holes
The air begins to smell familiar
(
) We have been betrayed

-               114 The clan is gathered outside, the sun beats down on the Spartan courtyard
Kiriko's body is twisted, bound to a pole like one of the Bonsai trees
Ozunu delivers his eulogy
child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us
She refused these gifts
Rejected our clan

(') Hers is a shame that can only be purged with blood
He unsheathes the ancient Wakizashi, then offers the hilt to Takeshi
(') You who returned her shall have this honor
Takeshi hides a smile as he takes the blade
Kiriko looks out into the clan and finds Raizo
He can hear her heart pounding
Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to strike
Blood pounds in Raizo's ears
The sword plunges into her heart
Raizo hears it die- And feels his own heart stop
115
-                            115 bucket of water slaps Raizo awake
He's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by thick rope that bites into his flesh
Ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan, down to the youngest of them
Watching silently
He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length of his face
Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the building in Dubai
When he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the rest of the clan as to Raizo
You are Ozunu
Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan
This is our deepest truth
Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more

The message that says hope and escape are futile
(') Weakness compels strength
Betrayal begets blood
This is the way of the Nine Clans

He looks back at Raizo, approaching slowly
Taking his time
(') have waited many years for this moment
have dreamed it, many times
He hits Raizo
Hard
(') You will suffer for seven days, one day for each year you defied me
He takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very small piece of Raizo's flesh, from the upper arm
Raizo doesn't cry out
(') For seven days, we will
take
from you, as  have just done
Everyone here will take from you
Piece by piece
You will live through it all, you will feel through it all
You will watch as the birds fight over the pieces
He  Raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause instant agony
This time Raizo does cry out
(') You will know pain like no other human being has ever known
He twists something in Raizo's belly and violent spasms wrack the young man's body
Blood burbles up through his mouth and flows down his chin

One last gouge in Raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder through him
Confident, victorious, Ozunu turns and walks a few steps away as -- -- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor
Takeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing something amidst the bile
Father
Ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder single  light blinking through the gore
He nudges it with his foot
and    as he realizes what he's looking at
He slowly raises his eyes -- -- and meets Raizo's gaze as suddenly -- --  rock the orphanage's centuries-old gate
reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of blinding lights
The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights
The ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but the shadows are gone
There's no place for the ninjas to hide anymore
We  Mika and Maslow in one of the lead vehicles as -- -- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it over Raizo's helpless form
Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off a long burst
Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and dodges the others
He slides into one of the few remaining shadows

The explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous splashing through the courtyard, but Takeshi is gone
They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the run
No more grenades, not until we get the children out
But some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the flames spreading through the ancient timbers
The carnage continues
Maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for Raizo, pistol in hand
One of the 's screams as a shuriken rips open his face as other Mps  back at the ninja, tearing him apart with gunfire
Mika makes it to Raizo's side
He smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her knife
What took you
You knew 'd come
Just because  was asleep doesn't mean  couldn't hear you
Mika finishes with the rope
Raizo pulls free and reaches for a fallen ninja's sword and chain
(') And  forgive you

/// -      116 The fires are ripping through the interior, leaping from bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished wooden floors as -- -- Raizo kicks down the burning wall of the empty dorm, the futons smoldering
Raizo continues into the next hall to find -- -- Takeshi waiting for him
An apparition in the wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of fire
Come, little brother, let us play like old times They spring at other
Meeting in the middle of the hallway as the flames dance around them
recalling the lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their training
Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on steel
Neither giving an inch
Evenly matched in skill and ferocity
Locking together for a moment Takeshi smiles
(') No death tasted as sweet as hers
Raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks again
Takeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low beneath Raizo's swinging chain as -- -- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking Takeshi's attack, but -- -- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip
As he brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain around the blade and locks it tight
Both men spin in their sudden embrace
Faces inches from each other

He moves to slam it into Raizo's side
but Raizo over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he -- --  the steel into Takeshi's heart
He still stands for a , more by inertia than will, then slumps, dead, to the floor
Raizo stalks down the hall
One last task ahead of him

/      117 /  - Raizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody footprints moving soundlessly
From the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice You have not forgotten your training
You will always be mine, child
Raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his footsteps now bringing every sound possible
Ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off a cloak of midnight
(') Perhaps this is the best way for you to die
His blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain blade begins to spin
The breath  take after you are dead, will be the first of my life
Raizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the power of an enormous buzz saw-- Hacking timbers in half-- Carving scars in the floors and walls-- Braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but-- Ozunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently () 2nd    6/4/08   91

She runs for him

-                119 Raizo begins to weaken
An attack misses wrapping a beam and Ozunu has his opening- His assault is ferocious
Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out
Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or deflecting the whirlwind attack until-- One sound cuts through the furious fight
Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as-- The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place
Die you fuck
She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him
Bitch
scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor
But the distraction gives Raizo his chance
The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu
Rage thunders the hall
Mika gets back up and aims but-- Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears

Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst, his blade shatters through Raizo's chain-- Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his chest
Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces
Mika
Run
Where is he
can't see him
Get away
Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith
His eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull
She spins around but is too late
The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as- Raizo finds them
He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls-- His pain a force of nature unleashed
The chain blades crackle in the air- Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which- Finally shatters against Raizo's fury
And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched rag doll
Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and-- --hurries to Mika's side
He picks Mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door
