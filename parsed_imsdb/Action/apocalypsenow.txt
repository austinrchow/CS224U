December 3, 1975
1    - It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp
mist clings to the trees
This could be the jungle of a million years ago
Our   , through the mist,   to the tepid water
small bubble rises to the surface; then another
Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to emerge; a helmet
Water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud
Printed on a helmet, in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer
" The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is painted in an odd camouflage pattern
He looks to the right; he looks to the left; he looks  , and slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely
Our  , We begin to  natural, though unrecognizable  , far off in the distance
We    a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can in the mud
hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears
As we  , we  that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a -60 machine gun, hand painted in a paisley design
Now the   ,  the ancient growth, the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes
to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever
Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make no sound
slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching
The     the Vietnamese, them, until suddenly, directly in front about ten feet away, an enormous  clad in rags and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side, steps in front of them
He smiles laconically, and     that rip By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out with
Out   as the men around us are thrown and torn, screaming and scattering into the jungle
More appear; unexplainably, out of the growth
It is now that we fully  the bizarre manner in which they are dressed
Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals
Some of them have long savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved; they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else
They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns
They appear one with the jungle and mist, as they move
The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping mud, his
We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly running for his life; we   the jungle with him, only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling painted and wearing feathers like an Indian him to the ground,  , as and   scatter above us
Men scream and die around us
The screams amid the  and are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is frightened
An  wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign on it, wearing war paint, bends  , reaching down with a large knife, preparing to scalp the dead
, along with the running sandals of a Vietnamese soldier,    , only to be stopped by still another of the savage-looking with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth and green beret
He opens his flame-thrower directly and the  soldier and we are incinerated in flame, bright psychedelic orange-red flame
Outrageous, loud, electric    the  : : 2 The   proceed as the   , growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying; transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely look at, like the sun itself
Then it , breking apart, and shattering once again
It begins to cool, as the
It is as though    through the white center of cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more distant
The
We are   planetary nebulae;  through the stars;  closer to the Earth
We can   the now
We   to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds, as though  from a satellite
The
We are   to the earth; through the soft clouds, close enough that we can   the Western Hemisphere; to North America; , to America, then California; Los Angeles,   to the odd, finger-like shapes of : 3 The  finally   a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day
It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes
They are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures
The boat belongs to the head of a large American Corporation, and this is his party
This man, , is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun
Others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint
Charlie is going on and on : It's crazy -- sugar is up to 200 dollars a ton -- sugar
What about oil
Food, oil --look, let me show you something
This is the economy of the United States in two years -- He takes a newspaper, draws a circle
(continuing) This is West Germany
(he draws another, bigger circle) This is Japan
(another , bigger) This is Italy
(a dot) This is Iran
(a very big circle) And this is Saudi Arabia
In two years
(a gigantic circle) Do you understand
What's to prevent it
Maybe nothing
But 'll tell you, didn't build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing
We can protect our interests
(pause, for a drink) We are still the most powerful nation in the world
Militarily
He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper
(continuing) You know bodyguard; he was a captain in Viet Nam
You talk to him, except he won't talk
This kind of man can kill you with his pinky
nice quiet fella, though
The      from this group
(continuing) Carries a attache case at all times
You know what's in it
(another sip) An Ingram Machine pistol
Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we  , and a , the voice of someone thinking,    it : (
) don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit
You can kill neither should this country
with the ridge of your If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with we should have the respect			your knee
but you of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with takes another war
your pinky
The    the guests of this small party : Pictures being taken, some people are swimming
It is the good life
Now '
(
) The attache case has been empty for three years, but it makes him safe to think there's a machine pistol in it
don't like automatic weapons
They jam
saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his -16 to automatic, and it jammed
How much money did the contractors make on the -16
Our    through the people on the boat; some reading, flirting, drinking
(
) (continuing) He likes to hear stories about Nam
tell him  can't; they're not cleared
The truth is he wouldn't understand
We can now    with his   , looking the opposite way
An attache case resting near to him
We (
) (continuing) There's no way  can tell them
what really happened over there
wouldn't've believed it if someone'd told me
We are now  on his back
Occasionally, he sips from a beer, but we cannot see his face
(
) (continuing) There was only one part that mattered -- for me, anyway don't even know if  remember all of it
can't remember how it ended, exactly -- because when it ended  was insane
: 4
- Saigon boom street in late 1968
There are bars and shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes
Our    one particular officer;
, in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his shoes and sell him things
(
) But  know how it started for me --  was on
and
in Saigon; my first time south of the  in three months wasn't sure, but  thought this guy was following me
Willard looks back
5 an American
6 Willard ducks into a bar
7
- Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few tables and chairs, and a juke box
The lounge is fairly crowded
Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly past the soldiers at the bar
Some of them, catching sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by
An   enters the bar, buys a couple of drinks and approaches Willard's table
How about a drink
Sure, thanks
He sits down at the table with the drinks
Winning the war by yourself
(he calls for the waiter) Part
Which part is that
My part
(  ) Beer, with ice and water
That's good gin
'm sure it is, but  had hepatitis
Delta
No
North
Yeah
Way north
What unit were you with
None
Rangers, eh
Sort of
The   starts
Annoyed , Willard looks over his shoulder
Were you Longe Range Recon -- No --  worked too far north for He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the Captain leans over the table to light it for him
Willard notices the  on the street has glanced in the bar, then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway
That's quite an array of ribbons
Let's talk about you
was an  for the 25th
Tracks
Yeah
Fat
That's real fat
Sometimes
At least you always have enough water
How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry
Thirty -- sometimes fifty
You know,  can remember once, getting back below the  -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron
just couldn't believe how much water they had
We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies
And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over
could've killed them
(solemnly) swear to God  would have, too, if
didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam
We do
How long were you up there
long time
year
Waiter another beer
go up on missions
Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me
Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the Civilian
The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain
He rises and comes over to the bar
(continuing) What do you want
(indicating the Army jeep) If you're
Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us
Whose orders
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th Battalion -- -2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang
Who are you
The agency
Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks roght out toward the jeep without saying another word
The Civilian follows
8
- darkly painted ""  over low paddies and jungle before emerging onto an open plain
It crosses a barbed wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily fortified, concealed compound
(
) They took me to some place outside Nha Trang
Intelligence Headquarters for all operations in South East Asia
'd worked for Intelligence before -- Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground corridor -- they enter
9    - door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room
strange reddish light pervades
The room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke
The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it
Captain
Willard, -4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir
(
) Okay, Willard, sit down
Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor
Across from him, around steel desks and tables sit several men
The nearest one, a puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind him sits a  and a seedy-looking
Have you ever seen this officer before, Captain Willard
He points to the Major
No, sir
This gentleman or myself
No, sir
believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right
am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir
Very good
He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval
The Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain
've worked with them on occasions and  saw the movie , sir
The officer smiles at this
Then you can appreciate Command's concern over their -- shall we say 'erratic' methods of operation
(pause) have never favored elite units, Captain, including your paratroopers or whatever
Just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesn't give him any priviliges in my book -- not in this man's army
We didn't need 'em in Korea -- no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy and an -1 Garand, none of this fancy crap -- no sir
(stopping him) Major
We have Special Forces detachments all along the Cambodian border
Two here and another one here -- twelve or fourteen Americans -- pretty much on their own; they train and motivate Montagnard natives; pick their own operations
If they need something, they call for it, and get it within reason
What we're concerned with is here
10    - The  detachment at Nu Mung Ba
It was originally a larger base, built up along the river in an old Cambodian fortress
The area has been relatively quiet for the past two years -- but -- 11 Captain, we know something's going on up there -- Major -- The Major looks at some papers in front of him
Communications naturally dwindled with the lack of
activity, this is routine, expected
but six months ago communication virtually stopped
About the same time -- large numbers of Montagnards of the 'Nong descent began leaving the area -- this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade Tribe that lived in the area for centuries
But what is unusual is that we began to find Rhade refugees too -- in the same sampans as the 'Nongs
These people aren't afraid of
They've put up with war for twenty years -- but something is driving them out
We communicate with the base infrequently
What they call for are air strikes, immediate -- always at night
And we don't know what or who the air strikes are called on
Who
You see, no one has really gone into this area and come back alive
Why me
Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel, Special Forces
We understand you knew him
He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand
Yeah
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba
The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder, flicks it on
The recording is first  -- the then asks for more information on target coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military
Then a frantic  comes on, talking slurred, like someone dumb, except very fast
( ) Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick -- Mark flare -- affirmative damn -- Immediate receive -- hearing automatic weapons fire man
is  and a lower, slower  in background
Blue Delta five This Big Rhine -- three Need that ordinance immediately Goddamn give it to me immediate Christ -- Big Rhino -- Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn
heavy  of    -- -- , and faintly, very faintly we -- more  -- suddenly a low, clear peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words
This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta
That's Colonel Kurtz
(
) want that napalm dropped in the trees -- spread it among the branches
We'll give you a flare -- an orange one -- bright orange
() We'd also like some white phosporous, Blue Delta
White phosporous, give it to me
interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off
only met Kurtz once
Would he remember you
Maybe
What was your impression of him
Willard shrugs
You didn't like him
Anyone got a cigarette
The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks
(continuing) thought he was a lame
lame
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces,  guess
We had an argument
About what
don't know
He was a lame, that's all
But why
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill
Well, he's killing now
Maybe
What does that mean
Maybe it's not Kurtz
don't believe he's capable of that
just don't believe it
It's got to be Kurtz
The point is that Kurtz or somebody attacked a South Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three days ago
Last week a Recon helicopter was lost in the area -- another took heavy damage -- direct fire from their base camp
Our Recon flight
Ours
Touchy
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy
-- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why
Then terminate his command
Terminate
Terminate with extreme prejudice
12    - waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms
Navy patrol boat (
) is waiting by a dock area
This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily armed
Its men stand at attention in a small and simple military ceremony
Willard approaches them in battle- dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet, -16
The boat commander salutes Willard
13 We hear the introductions faintly,  Willard's
(
) met the
crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class
Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class
Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class
Miller; they called him Mr
Clean
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise
All right with me,  used to drive a taxi
Let's go
The Chief nods
They all break formation and jump aboard and otherwise go about their work
The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from the dock
The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads to the ocean
: 14    - The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another
15
-   - Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale
Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone
The Chief mans the wheel and the
Lance climbs back from his position
He looks at Willard, who just stares ahead into space, swallowing
: 16    - The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds -- the sea is calm again
: 17      - The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat
We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit  think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River
It's all Charlie's turf from there on out
We're gonna have some help to get in the river
You know these waters, Chief
'Bout six months ago  took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge
He was regular Army too
Shot himself in the head
brought his body back down
Shot himself
What for
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud
Who knows
Pause, looking at Willard
18    - Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out and replaced quickly
The boat shakes slightly
There is a distant   like interrupted thunder
All the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills beyond
The buffeting and   -- they all stand silently -- suddenly it stops
Arch light
hate that -- Every time  hear that noise something terrible happens
Anybody see some smoke
Too far inland
There they are
He points up to the sky
19   - Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we the black silhouttes of four -52 bombers, their vapor trails streaming white against the dark blue sky
Charlie don't ever hear 'em
Not till it's too late -- don't have to hit you neither, concussion'll do it for a quarter mile or better
Burst your ears -- suck the air outta your lungs
20    -  - They are looking up
Willard sits down, unconcerned
He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec
He flips through the letters and other documents
(
) The dossier on  detachment had letters from Kurtz' wife and the wives and families of his men
All asking where to send future mail, understanding the necessery silence due to the nature of their work -- None of the men had written home in half a year
Occasionally, in the b
g
, we  the terrifying buffeting of the distant -52
21   - studying, examining a report
22   - Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his career as represented in the pictures in the dossier, as Willard reads : (
) Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a dedicated and well-disciplined spirit
He is a fine officer, combining military efficiency -- with a broad background in the Humanities, the Arts and Sciences
Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the 161st Petroleum Supply Group sign
(
) (continuing) He views his military career as the dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to those darker, less fortunate areas in the world
of Kurtz at jump school
(
) (continuing) feel Captain Kurtz' request for Special Forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian concerns, and his somewhat liberal politics, though  can see no reason to deny it
of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam jungle
His face is blank and vacant
(
) (continuing) We feel Major Kurtz' need to bring a sense of Western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be of use in accordance with our 'Vietnamization' programs
Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just a
: 23
- (
) One day later we came to an advanced staging area along the coast
This was our last chance to pick up supplies before approaching the mouth of the Nung River
The     leading up along the long load- ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera- tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist
" Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers -- helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men
Nobody builds advanced staging areas like the Americans
As the
approaches the docking area, Lance notices something
Hey
They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water- skier who waves as he slaloms by
The men just look at one another
24 The
pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings
Lance --  want you to go with the Captain an' get three extra drums of fuel and maybe scrounge some more 50 caliber
Yeah -- look at those uniforms
25    -   - platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the airplane
Poor bastards, have a long year to go
The troops turn and march   with six weeks of Advanced Infantry Training to back them up
26    -  -
- They are tying up at the dock -- a young  is fill- ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard
don't know anything about these papers, sir
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like  said
Well, you know  don't have the priority to do that, sir
It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int
Who's your commanding officer
Right now --  am
Well who the hell verifies that
do
He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused
No shit -- what's all the activity for around here
The show -- What show
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff -- This -- Bob Hope or the like -- No sir,  think -- this'll be a little bit different -- Where's it gonna be
He points -- 27    -   - large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and garnished with concertina wire
It is empty -- : 28    -   - The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men
Some of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in the jungle for months
All have one thing in common, to see and if possible grab an American girl
Their need far surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert, or child-molester
To counter their need of course are the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep- herds and assorted psychological warfare aides
Even so armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire
29 jammed in the crowd It's really too much --  mean 've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta
What cat
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant
never heard about that
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man --  mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew
So what happened
He was working
patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back
Yeah -- typical
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold
Poking pins in her an' all that
Sergeant says, don't do her like that
You leave your shitty little hands off that girl
Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again
You'll wish you hadn't
Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag
Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes
They nail him for it bad
He's in the
-- didn't give him no medals or nothing -- In the b
g
, we begin to  a  of ; the  of four helicopters approaching
All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment
On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large Playboy rabbits
Finally the blades are trimmed and a strange silence descends over the men
The door of the copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets step out with -16's to varied catcalls
When this abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges
He is the epitome of a Hollywood
Hair is combed impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely quiet the man
He walks over to the microphone
'd like to say hello from all of us up here, to all of you out there
All of you who've worked so hard during Operation Brute Force -- Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen -- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors
And  want you to know that we feel proud of you and know how hard your job is
To prove it -- we've brought some entertainment we think you're gonna like: The Playmate of the Year and her two runners up
He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing "Suzy
" 30 as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic manner -- smiling
The faces of the
's pass -- their jaws drop -- some look almost horrified
Chef is hypnotized -- Mr
Clean cries
Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental tenderness
Others grab the air in front of them
With each movement their need increases by the square
31    -  -  - They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget -- the attack dogs are trampled
The mob as one surges forward onto the wire
Men scream and fall into the moat, which is filling up fast
The Agent sees this all as he has seen it before
He casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows, then the two Green Berets
The   -- the black Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it
They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss
The Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below
Such are the ways of war
: 32
- The
moving further up the primitive coastline
There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle
(
) Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing but us and the coastline
felt like  had set off for the center of the earth
Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead
Smoke
Where
They all turn
Chief points up the coast
33   - thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle
Black smoke
secondary burning
The Chief grabs field glasses
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there
Hueys, lots of 'em
First Air Cavalry
They're the ones gonna get us into the River
34   - vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf
35
-  - They wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men
Overhead jets swoop by  , the  drowning out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men
We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it
36    - Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers
The two out- side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust
It cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side
Two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready
Then a tall, strong looking man emerges
He wears a well-cut and neatly-stretched tiger suit
It is -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache
He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash
It is no ordinary hat but a
Dodgers baseball hat
He walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle
His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses
(bellowing) Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards -- give me some room to breathe
Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off
37 He was not quite prepared for this
38 turning to his Bring me some cards
Sir
Body cards, you damn fool -- cards
The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic
Two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over
They are well-tanned and carry no weapons
They seem more casual about the Colonel than anyone else
The Sergeant walks up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance
(formally) Captain -
Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group --  carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp --  believe you understand the nature of my mission
(not looking up) Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do
Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain
He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the deck of new cards and fans them
The Colonel strides right past Willard with no further acknowledgement
The others follow, 39 The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of devastation
Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore comes to each
corpse he drops a playing card on it -- carefully picking out which card he uses
(to himself) Six a spades -- eight a hearts -- Isn't one worth a Jack in this whole place
The Colonel goes on about this business
40 moving through the corpses, dropping the cards
On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him
He stops
What
Here
You sure
The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down the card he was holding
Kilgore strides over to the young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t Willard
(continuing) What's your name, sailor
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- Johnson, sir
Lance Johnson
The surfer
That's right, sir
Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand
It's an honor to meet you Lance
've admired your nose-riding for years --  like your cutback, too
think you have the best cutback there is
Thank you, sir
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- 'm Bill kilgore -- 'm a goofy foot
41 His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the background
(
) This is Mike from San Diego and Johnny from Malibu -- they're good solid surfers -- none of us are anywhere near your class, though
Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel --
Willard, 4th Recon -- Just hold up a second, Captain -- 'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here
Willard eats it, for now
Kilgore puts his hand on Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in- discriminately on the bodies as they talk
(continuing) we do a lot of surfing around here
Like to finish up operations early and fly down to Vung Tau for the evening glass
Have you ever surfed the point at Vung Tau liked the beach breaks around Na Trang a lot -- good lefts
He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them
(continuing) we keep three boards in my Command Huey at all times
You never can tell when you're gonna run into something good
got a guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict a swell two days in advance
We try to work it in
He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in horror at the sky
Kilgore pauses
(continuing; to himself) Hell, that's an Ace if  ever saw one
He puts the card in the gaping mouth
42 We  the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f
g
The card has the shield of the  printed bautifully, and above it the motto:
Where've you been riding, Lance
haven't surfed since  got here
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- 'd like to see you work -- 've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too
: 43
- Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by a table set up in front of the command copter
Everywhere we  armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil drums etc
Hueys are constantly  over in the far distance
Kilgore looks at the map
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for
got bored in Saigon
What's the furthest you been in
Haiphong
Haiphong
Shit, you jump in
No
Walked
What'd you do for supplies
(he shrugs) Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches
Can you trust them
No
They put out two or three for every one  needed
When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out
If something feels wrong, you just pass it up
On one mission, had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars
Nu Mung Ba
Last  heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba
When did you hear
'Bout a year ago
Is Kurtz still alive
Who knows
Seems to me he got himself fragged
i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent
Maybe a rumor
Helluva man -- remarkable officer
Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day
General of the Army
Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Did you knew Kurtz
met him
Don't you agree
He musta changed
(pointing to the map) got to get into the Nung River, here or here
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy
Hairy
mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- 've lost a few recon ships in there now and again
So
heard you had a good bunch of killers here
And  don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River
You say you don't know Kurtz
met him
You talk like him
don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but  like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one
You'll find enough Cong up there
What about this point here
He puts his finger on the map
(continuing) What's the name of that goddamn village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook names all sound the same
He motions to one of his surfers
(continuing) Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop
Boss left
What do you mean
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell
Nice
Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left
(to Willard) There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country
It's all goddamn beach break
It's hairy ,though
That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us
It's Charlie's point
How big it is
Six to eight feet
Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters
(to himself) six-foot left
Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea
Boss
What's the wind like
Light off shore -- really hollow
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point
Hell, we'll pick your boat up and lay it down like a baby, right where you want it
This is the Cav boy -- airmobile
can take that point and hold it as long as  like -- and you can get anywhere you want up that river that suits you, Captain
Hell, a six foot left
(he turns to an advisor) You take a gunship back to division -- Mike, take Lance with you -- let him pick out a board, and bring me my Yater Spoon -- the eight six
don't know, sir -- it's -- it's -- (hard) What is it
Well,  mean it's hairy in there -- it's Charlie's point
Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated
Charlie don't surf
44    -  - What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam
Kilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and has surfboards strapped underneath
45 Kilgore strides up to the side door, dressed for battle
He looks out, around
He turns to his door
How do you feel, boy
Like a mean motherfucker, sir
He turns to his
man
Let's go
46 Helicopter rotors build up speed -- gas turbines belching fire from their jet pipes -- dust flying as fifty helicopters rise;    and deploy into attack formation
47 Helicopters moving  the : almost a dance of dragonflies
48
-
- , , Willard looks ahead -- Kilgore sits near the door
Below they see the jungle whisk by and they are suddenly over the ocean, low and fast
49 of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre looking mounts
of the three surfboards strapped below the command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry
And finally,   of the men -- nervous, excited very few of them really scared -- they fondle their rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades, claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers; -60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars and bayonets
50 Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch the waves -- then he sits back relaxed
(to Willard) We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out
Music
Yeah
Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it
51 behind the  and - -- the ocean rushes below
Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust -- turn on coordinates 1-0 -- niner, assume attack formation
The helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears toward the coast
(
) Eagle Thrust formation target 2800 yards -- begin psch-war operations
52    - The ocean rushes below as suddenly the out Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries
" 53    - From the water we  the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun- ships -- troop carriers -- medevac and recon --  over low in battle formation  out "Ride of the Valkyries
" 54
-
- behind pilot -- 700 -- 600 yards -- 500 -- Commence firing
The whole copter shakes
55
- Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind
This village commands a delta where ocean and river merge
Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being unloaded
We  bunkers with
regulars ambling about
Suddenly we  the distant  -- Everyone stops; they stare out to see
Men scream orders -- women run from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere there is activity to prepare for the defense of the village
Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements
People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run to tunnels and trenches
The    with the   of 56
- coming directly at us;
57 looking down through the helicopters as they approach the village
58
-
- behind pilot 700 yards -- 600 -- 500 -- commence firing
The whole copter shakes
59
- We  rockets  from pods --    -- grenade launchers  away -- and - pour streams of lead and tracers with the  of a 60    - behind lead gunship
They  in over the beach streaming  from doors, pods and nose -- The ground is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut
The leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run below  back
61
- - crash around -- the  and  of the almost drown them out
The gunner frantically --  are  over -- rips around
The gunner is blown away
62 as the ship he is in swoops down, its into the village
63
- The Pilot leans out and  a charging
in the head with his
38, then ducks back in
- We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're hit
We got a hot
here
through the plexiglass
The Pilot back
- (continuing) Hell of a hot
Need immediate air strike on the tree line, Eagle Thrust
64
-
- , , Kilgore has
equipment -- he leans out near the door gunner
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts
(
) Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the  mark it
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line
65    - Four -4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast
66
- Fucking savages
Who
The enemy
Who else
67  '  - The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees
(
) (on radio) Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest you follow with cannon fire
68
- They circle the battle
(
) This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off
Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you
He turns to door gunner
(continuing) Right along the doors, boy
The gunner  leaning out -- (continuing) Fine
fine
little higher
Through the roof; yeah, that's good
He leans back in
(continuing) Didn't anybody bring me any bombs, grenades, claymores or anything
You didn't tell me to, sir
(grumbling) You shoulda known
Suddenly,   through the copter -- Plexiglass ; the copter vibrates and turns sharply
Kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on
(continuing) Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and -47's
The trees, eh
He grabs the
(continuing) Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six
Join me in sparaying some trees
(
) Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left
Take her in low, Lieutenant
69    -  , The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with ,   and
Other copters join -- The
break and run through the rice paddies in the f
g
--   around them -- they scream and fall  back
70
-
- , Kilgore looks out as three
break and run through the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows them -- the door gunner swings out and  two of them into the mud
He takes a bead on the third
Hold it, boy
He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings back inside
(continuing) Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant
They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for all he's worth
Kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside
Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's harness
(continuing) Rifle
hand passes him a -16
(continuing; hard) My rifle, soldier
There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300 Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope
Kilgore takes it and opens the bolt
71 Amazed at these proceedings
72 as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges
He gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut
73
He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud
The Huey  overhead, its huge shadow behind him on the mud
He turns and  with a pistol
74
-
- , Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes careful aim and the Cong is  flat into the paddy
Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge out the door
He hands Weatherby back into the copter
75 The gaudy rifle passed by him
(
) That's 27, sir
Anyone got a card
Somebody hands Willard the deck
He takes a card and flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from Kilgore
: 76    -  -  ,
Americans run through the hooches  and throwing Helicopters swoop overhead --   by -- Uniformed
regulars burst from a tunnel en- trance and charge the Americans
The  is at point blank range -- automatic, as the
are cut down
77
- , , ,
Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle- field
He has the
He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak to Lance
The
's cooling off fast -- we'll move in another company an' then we'll own it
(he laughs to himself) Charlie's point
He looks out toward the ocean
(continuing) Good swell
What, sir
said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet
Let's get a look at it
Lance looks at Willard and then agrees
78    - , The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up green wall as if surfing it
They tip up over and up at the last minute as the wave breaks
: 79    -  , Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and
regular troops outside a burning hut
is and sporadic -- an occasional  round in
soldier yells in Vietnamese in a southern accent and the prisoners are marched away
Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc
Three Hueys  in, fanning the smoke with their wind
The center one, the command ship, lands over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet
Another Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's
The doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and out steps Kilgore and Lance
From the other copter are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the crew
Willard follows
80    - They stride out across the debris-strewn beach
Kilgore stands majestically on the point watching the waves overhead
Incoming
They all dive, except Kilgore
He is watching a big set -- the   in the water about a hundred yards away, sending up a huge geyser of spray
Kilgore is unmoved
Look at that
They look
This
is still pretty hot, sir, maybe we oughta stand somewhere else
Kilgore pays him no mention
'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel
(without looking) It'll get here, soldier
He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the sand
(continuing) Change
Wh -- what
Change -- get out there -- want'a see if it's ridable -- change
It's still pretty hairy, sir
(bellowing) You want'a surf, soldier
He nods yes meakly
(continuing) That's good, boy, because it's either surf or fight
They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an -1 from one of the guards
They all think he's going to shoot the surfers or someone
They move back uneasy
(continuing) 'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's all
He cocks thye weapon
Lance looks around uneasily
The Colonel walks over
(continuing) You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance
think we ought to wait for the tide to come in
-- they all hit the dirt except for Kilgore
It  throwing sand through the air
Kilgore leans down yelling over the
Doesn't happen for six hours
Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto his helmet
(continuing) The tide -- doesn't come in for six hours
: 81    -  - They walk through shallows carrying brightly colored boards
They look very scared overhead,
Helicopters wheel by carrying out wounded
They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's shield on the left leg
The same shield is emblazoned on the boards along the word "Airmobile"
They edge into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak
82    -   - They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the beautiful waves breaking beyond them
83     , They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing hard and constantly looking around scared out of their minds
84
- Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses
Lance kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole
They far enough
Sure -- fine -- Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from a waiting lackey
(through megaphone) That's far enough -- pick one up and come on in -- 85    -  , They line themselves up on the point
good set is building
Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off -- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking around frantically
86 Another   over and  down the beach
Lance looks over at Willard
(to himself) Maybe he'll get tubed
What
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him
of   in
Incoming
Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head
The over Kilgore and out towards the point
Kilgore looks through his glasses -- two  in the water are
Son of a bitch
Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror
87    - Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down on the waves
88
- (to himself) The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer
Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy, too
What's that
Just something  read in the Free Press
They just missed a good set -- the chicken shits
Lance looks up
89   -   , They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke hangs over the water
(
) (megaphone) Try it again, you little bastards
90 He turns to Willard
(continuing) m not afraid to surf this place
'll surf this place
91 He turns, glowering to his lackeys
Bring that
, soldier
He grabs it
(continuing) Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels -- Goddamit,  want that treeline bombed -- yeah -- napalm -- gimme some napalm -- son of a bitch -- yeah, 'll take
or
's if you got any of them -- just bomb 'em into the Stone Age, boy
He throws the
back to a soldier -- another over -- everyone drops
(continuing; to himself) Son of a bitch
As the   on the beach behind him, KIlgore raises his -16 and  it full automatic in the general direction of the trees
He mumbles a few un- intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his rifle turning to Lance -- (continuing) We'll have this place cleaned up and ready for us in a jiffy, boy
Don't you worry
He  another clip as the   overhead
92    -  - sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us -- The
hangs below it
The Chief, mr
Clean and Chef stand watching this sight alomg with other soldiers
man guides the descending copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows
The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists -- load on ammunition and fuel
The battle is still going on around them
They all look up as a wadge of  streak over low and peel off one by one to begin their bombing run
93    -  - Phantoms  the trees with 20 mm  --  five inch  in salvo -- "Bull Pup"  -- drop (high explosives) and
's (Cluster Bomb Units) and finally an immense amount of
94
The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so- often when an  hits nearby
The boat begins to back out of the shallows
The  of are reflected on their faces; the  of the  drowns out almost everything
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain
saw that Colonel's Huey on the point -- Two   over
(continuing) Let's just get outta here
95    -   - ,  , , Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses -- smoke drifts over
Lance crouches below
Willard is up looking off in another direction
over, but even their noise is drowned out by the fierce  of the  and the deafening  of
Willard stares at the tree line where it comes down to the river
The  are making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust- ling steam thet nothing could live in
Willard's glance goes further downriver through the black smoke and there merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat
(to Lance) Look
There it is; the boat
Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face
But still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark against the sky
Willard silently motions Lance toward the boat
(whispers) He'll kill us
He can't kill us
(realizing as he says it) We're on his side
Kilgore  another clip at the tree line, and then strides back without looking at them
(almost to himself) You smell that
(louder) You smell that
What
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that -- They reflect the glow from the burning trees
(continuing; nostalgically) love the smell of napalm in the morning
One time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours
walked up it when it was all over; we didn't find one of 'em
not one stinking gook body
They slipped out in the night -- but the smell -- that gasoline smell -- the whole hill -- it smelled like
(pause) victory
He looks off nostalgically
You know, some day this war's gonna end
(sadly) Yes,  know
Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts them up in the air
(continuing) The wind -- What
Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases
(rising maniacally) Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's blowing on shore -- It's on shore
He leans down and practically grabs Lance
(continuing; screaming) It's gonna blow this place out
It's gonna ruin it
The kid can't ride sloppy waves
They turn and stare out to sea
96    -   - The wind has changed
Instead of blowing spray back over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange wind is causing white caps and cross chop
reducing the swell to slop
Mike and Johnny lay low on their boards, overjoyed
(
) The kid can't stand sloppy waves
97
-   - , , You don't expect this kid to ride that crap, do you
He's a goddamn artist, he needs something to work with
Slapping Lance on the shoulder
Yeah, 'm an artist, goddamit
(apologetically) Yeah -- yeah,  can understand how you feel
He turns toward the trees
(continuing) It's the napalm -- it's causing the wind -- ruining my perfect left
He staggers off toward the trees followed by his guards and other lackeys
(continuing; mumbling) The napalm -- ruin -- napalm my perfect left -- my perfect left point break -- napalm -- Lance motions with his eyes to Willard
98
The
along the river shallows -- The Chief and crew waiting and yelling
99 Are you finished surfing
Yeah
thanks
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel
Nah
Then let's get the hell out of here
They break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance
with them
They are cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some- thing and stops
Lance continuing
In a pile of equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards -- Willard looks at them
No -- no, Captain
Which one's the Colonel's
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer
Willard glances over to it with determination
There is still   coming in between him and the board
Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it
(
) Incoming
Incoming -- son of a bitch
The  bracket the
and line up the beach toward Willard
He stands there and doesn't move, the surfboard under his arm
The shells kick up sand
Lance has dropped
Fragments whistle by, one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board
(calm) This one , Lance
Yeah, Jesus Christ
Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm
Lance follows toward the boat, through the water
Willard hands the board up to Mr
Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and relieved
What'd you that for
When  was a kid , never had a Yater spoon
Mr
Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal
mount
The boat turns --    and toward the deeper water of the river -- the board clearly visible on the stern
: 100       - The
going down the river at full speed
It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy fire
101 They all are in full battle positions -- their twin fifty Cal
guns turning; warily covering the jungled banks
The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches against some armor plate, huddled with his -16 ready
Chef is behind him at the radio
Lance leans back from his forward turret
(yelling) Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down
They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst
(continuing) Let's put some distance between us and Charlie
The Chief nods
Lance --- Yeah
Why don't you roll us a big joint
think the Captain'd like that
They all look at Willard uneasily
After a suspensful pause, Willard smiles: Take one a mine -- He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge cigar-sized joint
They all smile -- Willard lights up
: 102    -
It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed
: 103    -  , ,  - The boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank
The men wait tensely listening -- You hear it again
No --  don't think so
But it'll be back
They were circling
It'll be back
You think he'd of shot us
When
Any time -- us -- Americans
Lance looks over at Willard
don't think he d of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board -- Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants
Can  go get those mangos now
'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile -- Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff
Sure
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped
It's a feeling you get in the jungle
When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying
How can you tell their weapons
an' how far they're going
Willard smiles
Mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest
their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the joints that may be lying around
If they're near a base camp, they wouldn't be conserving food; they'll be throwing it away half-eaten
If the branches aren't broken, their weapons are slung
But all this is just technique
There's a feeling you get after a while, that's what's important
was going through a village once
was looking for a certain party
took off my boots, and walked into each hut
It was midnight
went into three like that and suddenly  realized  d gone into each hut the same way -- standing up -- so the next one  went in on my belly
An  burst took out the door a bit above my head
(he shrugs) Things like that
pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted -- They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we  the distant  of - and indistinguishable language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the grow  until almost overhead
(
) (over a loudspeaker) 'm not gonna hurt or harm you, boy --  just want the board back -- You can understand -- It was one of my best -- You know how hard it is to get a board you like, boy
'm not gonna hurt or harm you -- Just leave it where  can find it -- The   on into the night -- the same speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise ceases
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much
wonder if that was the same copter
He's probably got 'em all over the river with that recording
We better move now while it's dark
Chef steps forward with a plastic basket
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you -- 'll go with him -- They all look at him
(continuing) wanta get my feet on solid land once in awhile -- He grabs an -16 and follows Chef over the side
104
-   - ,  - They cautiously walk through the underbrush
Chef
Yes, sir -- Why they call you that
Call me what, sir
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff
No, sir -- 'm a real chef, sir -- 'm a sauciere -- sauciere -- That's right, sir --  come from New Orleans --  was raised to be a sauciere
a great sauciere
We specialize in sauces; my whole family
It's what we do
was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School;  was saving the money
They called me for my physical so  figured the Navy had better food
What are you doing out here
Cook school -- that did it
How
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled
Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling
looked in, an' it was turning gray
couldn't stand it went into radio school
They move into a slight clearing
(whispering) -- quiet -- Chef crouches close -- redies his -16
Willard ges- tures that he heard something; he points
105
- over jungle --   Willard and Chef
(silent) There
He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover the spot
few yards from them they hear something move
It is obviously no small jungle creature
They walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns at the ready
They look at each other
Willard is cold, methodical, doing something he knows well
There is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles
He and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking the probable
Willard directs the Chef with hand gestures, and bird and cricket sounds
They move stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the hunted
The two men drop low into the elephant grass, and remain motionless
Then Willard makes the cricket noise, and they move closer
Willard's left hand edges out along the -16's far end, so that he only has to point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he wants
He makes another command and they rush the trapped enemy
106
-    - Suddenly there is a   -- The grass folds down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and from the hip lets go
The Chef retreats short  into the grass -- the grass folds almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at them; snarling magnificently
They  wildly, emptying their clips
It's a motherfucking tiger -- goddamn
He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a man can be
(continuing; screaming) Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger -- motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh -- Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared out of his head as well
107    -   - They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into the jungle
Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it
(hysterical) Ohhhh -- tiger
Oh goddamn
It's a tiger
Jesus Christ
Goddamn, a tiger
Ohhhhhhhh
The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around the boat, trying to find safety
willard follows from the jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night
What's this tiger shit
No shit
think  shot the hell out of him
You think
wasn t looking
was running
Was a big tiger -- no shit
Who stopped to measure him -- let's get the hell out of here
motherfucking tiger --  could've been killed
The   to life -- the
pulls away with great speed
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you
Mangoes
There as a fucking tiger in the woods --  could've been eaten alive
'm never going into that jungle again
gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat
They move off; swallowed by the darkness
The remain, as    a   the jungle
(
) He was right, the Chef -- never go into the jungle, unless you're ready to go all the way
: 108
- Willard, thinking, his
Suddenly, he turns around, and we  his face
(
) What was in the jungle
What was there, waiting for me
He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating his face momentarily
There is something different about him; a maturity, a cool inner peace
(
) (continuing) Kurtz was in there
Or was he; was it Kurtz
He was just a name to me now;  couldn't remember a face, a voice -- he just didn't add up to me
all his liberal bullshit about the end of savagery -- and the role of our culture, our way of life
Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat -- there is still some
They talk and drink and laugh
(
) (continuing) Our way of life --  really started to look forward to meeting Kurtz again
: 109   -   - We : -- must remember that we owe our thanks for these to the wonderful services of the
-- here's another oldie -- this one dedicated
110 by himself on the

He is barechested, wearing a hat made of a banana palm
to the fire team at An Khe from their groovy
Fred the Head -- 111 The Rolling Stones and "Satisfaction

The    -- they all dig it
Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from his file on Kurtz

Lance waterskiing to "Satisfaction
" 113 alert, at the rear of the boat -- his -16 ready, just in case
114 Willard opens a letter from the packet
We can  it is a private correspondence -- feminine writing on the envelope
(
) The dossier of  Dtachment contained letters from the families and wives of Kurtz' men There were letters from Kurtz' wife as well
115    - It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner is the return addess of Mrs
Colonel Walter Kurtz -- Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year old American Beauty
She is classically American
116    - looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the letter, straightens it
(
) Dearest Walt --  have to confess something
know how you feel about this, but  had to ask Bob to find out what he could -- just couldn't stand it anymore, not knowing where you are, whether you're alive or dead
'm sorry Walt, 'm sorry  said that
Bob didn't tell me anything -- he said he couldn't --  can't stand it anymore, Walt --  just can't stand it
Willard looks out at the jungle
Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests pass by
The Rolling Stones  on in the b
g
(
) (continuing) have to take the kids to school every morning now -- carpools just never work out
Jeff came home with a black eye on Tuesday but said he won anyway
He wouldn't tell me what the fight was about
Jeff keeps asking where you are -- he has maps of Viet Nam in his room now
He misses you very much
can't take this much longer, Walt love you and  just can't stand it
117 He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with a stenciled date on it
It is also noted that this was the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba
It is addressed to Kurtz' wife
He opens the letter -- it is written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic- ular
It reads: Sell the house Sell the car Sell the kids Find someone else Forget it 'm never coming back Forget it -- He folds up the letter
118    - He looks out at the ominous jungled mountains
: 119    -
-   - The
pulls in towards an American outpost that is being used as a forward medical evacuation center
Various helicopters pads are , but only one heli- copter -- the -34 painted with Playboy rabbits that brought the girls to Hau Fat
Several soldiers in rain- coats come out the dock as the
pulls up
120
- , Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the dreary muddy camp
Two soldiers pass
Soldier -- where' s your
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell -- Well , who's in command here
don't know -- don't have any idea -- 'm just the night man -- He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- What about you, soldier
The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling idiotically and making animal noises
He stumbles off after his friend
121
-   - He looks around disgustedly (
) (whispering) Captain -- Willard turns around looking for where the voice came from
(
) (continuing) Over here, Captain -- He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a large tent so that he won't get wet
He wears the same clothes as before, but is much dirtier
He motions Willard into the tent
122
-
- , They duck inside -- it is dark and damp
On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the pilot
The nearest one, , a blonde, picks leeches out of her feet
The other two,  and , play cards with the helicopter pilot
Willard looks over the situation
You came in on that boat, didn't you
Yeah -- Where are you headed
What's it matter
Get to the point
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of -- Yeah,  caught your show at Hau Fat
They all look over
Oh --  see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh -- Captain Willard -- go ahead
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning
Yeah
Well  mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days
Dreadful
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat,  mean real combat
Well -- We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here
We need all our fuel
He turns and starts to leave
But, Captain, think what these girls have done for the boys -- think of how they've risked -- Willard is almost out of the tent
Captain -- He turns around
(continuing) It's really rough here -- Captain -- we're just not built for it -- The Pilot laughs
That's rich -- Do us a favor -- 'd do one for you -- if  could -- Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life
'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe  like brunettes -- Take your pick -- they all like you --  can tell -- like all of them -- Good -- like  said, take your pick
said  like all of them
Now just a second -- 'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull
Willard turns to leave again
We need all our fuel anyway
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what  meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- Sit down -- we'll talk about it
Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent to do likewise
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me
My men -- What
That's what there is to talk about -- my man --  take a good care of my men -- The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening -- the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself
You're out of your skull -- We have a lot of pride in our unit -- How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think -- Esprit de corps -- No -- absolutely not -- One for all -- all for one -- You can keep your fucking fuel -- Willard gets up
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together
Get out -- Men of all races -- nationalities -- He gets up and starts out
Two drums -- Willard turns around slowly
(continuing) Two whole drums -- We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too -- don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- will --  assure you that -- You got a fifty on that -34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- 'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em -- He turns to go under the tent flap
(continuing) Have the girls freshen up a bit -- comb their hair -- put on something -- you know what  mean -- He leaves
123    -
- They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning it up in general
Mr
Clean sits in f
g
, cleaning an -16
You keep this thing in this condition an' it's gonna jam, Lance -- mark my words
Why don't you go pet the water buffaloes -- get off my back
Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes eating mud or whatever they do
They are painted jungle brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their sides the words have been stenciled in black: 1 Each -- Buffalo, Water -1A Army No
15239 Willard walks through them down to the boat
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge
All right  got a little surprise for you -- They all look up
(continuing) 've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel -- No shit
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's  think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there
don't believe you -- What're you trying to say, Captain -- You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor -- No shit -- hot damn -- 124
-
- , He has followed her into the tent awe-struck -- she casuallu starts unbuttoning her fatigue jacket and taking off her pants
he just stands there, his arms at his sides
've got every one of your pictures -- 've got the centerfold -- the Playmate's review -- the Playmate of the Year run-off -- everything, even the calender -- Well, get undressed and let's get it over with -- can't believe it -- 'd a never even got to see you if it wasn't for this war -- She lies down on the cot in only her panties
(continuing) You wouldn't mind -- uh kinda draping that jacket over you sort of the way you were in the calender, would you
Come on -- cut this crap -- gotta get back to Saigon -- Just let me look awhile --  just don't believe -- : 125
-   - , They have just finished making love
cathy looks very pleased
Lance finishes tying his boots -- she draws on his back
He gets up -- starts to leave
Well -- uh thanks -- see you around
Yeah
He leaves -- she pulls herself up and starts combing her hair -- Mr
Clean walks in
(continuing) Who are you
'm next -- She shrugs
: 126
-
- , He finishes tying on his boots -- pulls on his jacket -- his gun belt and picks up his -16
She looks up at him -- Ma'am -- 'd like to thank you for what you an' all your friends have done for us --  want you to know that me an' the men appreciate you coming all this way -- riskin' your lives -- living uncomfortably an' doing all you can to entertain us
want you to know personally, Miss, that for the past few minutes you have made me feel at home
She picks up a shoe to throw at him
he turns, exits f

(continuing) Just wanted to say that, ma'am
The   off his helmet
: 127
-   - The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the distance
Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations with
soldiers in them
There is a bright fire burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the night
(
) Two days and nights later, we approach the Do Lung Bridge
128 watching
Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the banks
The bridge is in a state of siege
Mortars and rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby jungle
Soldiers are everywhere -- scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead
Light automatic   is  occasionally
The
edges in under the span of the old bridge
Soldiers run up through the water
They are obscured in the darkness
gotta get out a here --  ll pay --  got money
Get away from this boat
Who's your
, soldier
The Soldier ducks back and runs away
Fuck you, you'll get what's coming to you
Other men approach the boat
young  steps forward
Captain Willard
That's me
Captain Willard -- we got these from Nha Thrang two days ago -- they expected you here then -- He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings, Willard takes it
(continuing) You don't know how happy that makes me, sir
Why
Now  can get out a here -- if can find a way out
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand
'd just clear out as soon as could if  were you, sir
They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again
Charlie will start throwing it in hard -- What is this bridge
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded
He points to the men getting ready to work
(continuing) Every night we build it and by 0800 they've blown it up -- it and a lot of good men -- But the generals like to say the road is open -- ha
Nobody uses that road except Charlie
He turns and splashes off into the darkness
(continuing) This is the cesspool of hell
(
) Incoming
and  into the bridge -- in the distance -- the  are thunderous
(yelling) All right -- Lance, go with the Captain an' see what you can scrounge -- Willard climbs out with Lance
(continuing; to Willard) Better make it fast, sir -- we don't really need much anyway
Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the bridge
129
- , They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road
overhead, they don't know where to run
Straight ahead, son of a bitch
They dive towards the voice
130    - They dive in, a  is crounched in f
g
holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably
You came right to it, son of a bitch -- Son of a bitch, sir
The Soldier doesn't respond
(continuing) Where's your chief supply officer
Beverly Hills -- What
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be
'mon -- There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road
Suddenly to their right an -60 from a sandbagged emplacement
(
) Get your asses down, buddy
They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement
Several  man a -60
One has a sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner
Willard and Lance edge up along the trench
Willard trips
Watch your feet, asshole -- Willard looks down
(continuing) You stepped on my face
We thought you were dead
The whole world loves a smart ass
They move ahead more carefully
The Gunner  away into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him
Finally he stops swearing to himself
What're you shooting at, soldier
Gooks
He turns and sees it's an officer
(continuing) m sorry, sir
It's all right, sergeant -- what's out there
They were tryin' to cut through the wire --  got 'em all  think
Oh yeah -- listen
There is a low moaning  from out in the wire -- it stops for aminute then continues hideously
He's trying to call his friends -- send up a flare
The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie light
The Gunner  a long
Those are all dead, stupid, he's obviously underneath 'em -- They think about this as the flare goes out
The gets more intense
Wake up the Roach
The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky  is leaned up against the trench
He kicks him hard several times
Roach wakes and just looks up
On his helmet are the words: "
" Yeah, man
Slope in the wire -- hear him
He listens, he does, he nods
(continuing) Bust him
Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool
He saunters up the machine gun dragging his -79 which has paisley designs all over it
Hear him
Sure , yeah
You need a flare -- No, it s cool
He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks the big slug into it
He snaps it closed then rests it across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the , calculating
(continuing) He's close -- real close
He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into the air
He listens again then
The off into the night
There is a sharp that cuts off the scream
Then the  of bodies or pieces of bodies coming down around them
(continuing) Muhhh Fuhhh
He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep
131    -
-  - , They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance
Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his -16 by and  in the distance
Geez,  wish they'd hurry
comes up on his way with some others to start building the bridge
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh
Yeah, it still runs
Do me a favor buddy, please
What is it
He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes
Send these out when you get back to the world
He puts them in Clean's hand
(continuing) It's to everyone  really knew -- the first girl  screwed -- my brother -- best friend --  wanted to tell 'em how much  enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years
gotta let 'em know
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow
Nobody comes in here
He points up at the mountain ridges
(continuing) The
312th -- over there the 307th -- on that hill we counted fourteen different guns in one minute -- they got rockets mortars, snipers in those trees, there's a million of those shitty little bastards out there -- we're all gonna die
He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency
(continuing) 'm gonna be dead
Clean takes the letters
(continuing) You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river
We ain't goin' down the river
The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking
(continuing) What's up river from here anyhow -- The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded
Spooky
Charlie
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back
He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and disgusted
Willard and Lance come back down the beach carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra -16's
Wow, you must a found the
, eh
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here
132    -   -
They edge through the shallows as the men light up their welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge -- then pull away and accelerate fast
133
- The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the bridge area and the  of heavy
: 134
-
-  - The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical downpour
Mr
Clean is in thef
g
, oiling and cleaning his 50-cal, his -11 and -79 -- the rest of the crew are forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas canopy
Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount
135
-   - The river is moving fast against them
all manner of de- bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the
(to Willard) can't see a fucking thing
There is a loud  , as one of the pieces of tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off
Willard climbs forward, and looks down
(continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette
Fucking plastic boat
Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole, warding off the big debris moving toward the
Clean joins him, helping
(shouting to Chief) What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down
Who knows what's up there
Can't be any worse than this
What do you think
think this river wants to take us home fast
'm practically goin' in reverse
Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary
Well, get in there
This whole area is lousy with -- We don't stand a chance
Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes
There is a really loud  against the hull
willard really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks
Get in there
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and 'm the responsible party
Get in there now or 'll bury you in this river
It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't do as he says
(finally relents, turns the helm) You're fucking crazy
You're going to get us all killed
The
navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary
: 136
-
- Rain is pouring down, but the
is slowed down to a snail's pace by Hyacinths, literally across the waterway
Willard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through them with machetes
137 having climbed to the highest point of the cockpit
It breaks through in about twenty feet
138 cutting through
he looks to Chef, who has stopped cut- ting, and is staring into the jungle
What do you see
don't know
He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark and high -- totally impenetrable
Keep cutting
They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong
139 cutting with all he's got
know it sounds stupid, but feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us
Probably is
Whatdoya think it thinks
That we're dumber than we look
Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them
It whips between them -- the   much later
Other   through and ricochet off the deck fittings
, and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon
Lance -- 'bout twenty meters starboard
Lance leaps down to his position
Willard, Clean and Chef cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free
There in the trees
Everything is confusion -- yelling --  -- the of heavy  ripping inti the
's fibreglass hull
140 Lance's twin guns return the
The Chief moves to one of the heavy guns and joins Lance in returning the
141 pushing, cutting
Bullets  and  around
Clean climbs onto the boat, and leaps onto a gun emplace- ment
142 Nobody really knows where the erratic fire is coming from
(back at the helm) Elevate Lance, in the tree
No, saw another
Thirty meters up, Lance;  saw the fucking flash
Lance grits his teeth,  -- 143 144 He  short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting it to salad
Suddenly more tracers from another direction -- Clean swings around --  smash against his shield and rip chunks from the surfboard
He  a long heavy burst at the jungle -- trees crumble
'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a- bitch, it's jammed, oh God, it's jammed
Clean is riddled by
Chief runs to Mr
Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead
He looks angrily to Willard
Willard and Chef are practically through
Willard leaps up, as Chef finishes the last strokes
He moves toward the cockpit
Throw me that ordnance
Chef throws him an -79 and several shells -- Willard opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over the edge of the cockpit
(continuing) Give me some kind a field a fire -- rip by
(exhausted) We're through
He climbs aboard and collapses
(continuing) Oh, God -- () ain't finished
ain't finished
Bring that bow ordnance into those trees
He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and  -- there is a low  and a  as the  arches into the jungle
145
- He  another burst as the   brightly
There is another  and  , another
large tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin- ning growth
We  strange  from the trees and jungle, hideous  and terror-filled
146 He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead
Willard  another  from his -79
147
The boat slams through the hyacinth growth, moving through the river,   at unseen enemy in the jungle
: 148
- The boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide, flat area in the river
149 The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded
They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be- cause they know they're too far from the banks to be shot at
They smoke pot and eat silently
Lance smokes a joint and looks at his gun
Splotches of paint have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount
The boat is a floating wreck
Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack by Chief
All of the men are silent
Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the shoulder
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks
Food's shot to hell
How much is left
Less than half -- sure is a mess down there
Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic sack
And the grass
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang
But we're running low on the other
Chief pushes Clean's body into the river
150 He notices something in the distance
151  ' light
152 Willard stands up, pointing up the river
Hey
They all look over
(continuing) That's a light down there -- Yeah, it is
What the hell is it
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light
153    -
- The
approaches the distant light -- which seems to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building
154    , straining to see; he uses field glasses
155   - Seems to be some figures standing on the dock
The figures pull back behind some drums
156 Watch it
They duck as    from the dock, stitching the water across the
's bow
The crew crouches, guns trained on the dock as the boat still approaches
(continuing) They're not Cong
(over the loud-hailer) We're Americans
Another , closer
Maybe you shouldn't say we're Americans
Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure it out
Chef, try your French
Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts: Nous sommes Americains -- Silence
(continuing) Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser
157 He looks through the glasses
158 Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums on the dock
(
) French Nationals -- they may not be too friendly, though
159 We drift closer to the dock
The Chef starts enjoying speaking French
Nous sommes Americains -- nous sommes des amis -- There is silence as the boat drifts closer
Then: (shouting out) Vous parlez Francais comme une vache espanole
(to himself) thought it was pretty good, myself
What'd he say
Said  speak French like a Spanish cow
(
) Laisser tomber vos armes -- Put the guns straight up -- stand away from the mounts
Do it
They do
(
) Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement -- Take her in slow
160    -   - The men on the dock move forward, cautiously
They are a young man, , about 25, strong and handsome, save for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left eye, which is covered by a patch
He is dressed in a tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para- troops
Also of the red beret are  LeFEVRE, a bear- ded, dark-looking man of 35, and   , a middle- aged half-breed slave
They all bear automatic weapons and suspicious in their eyes
As the boat pulls up to the dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the head man,  De , about fifty, small and deli- cate, with a strength about him
Hands on the heads
can't steer with my goddamn feet
Hey, they speak American
Who is the commanding officer
-- am -- 'm Captain
Willard
This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat
We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold
Philippe -- Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope from the deck and ties it to the dock
'll help you with -- Do not move -- Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain -- As  said, we can pay you in gold
Entirely unnecessary, Captain
He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise -- We share a common enemy -- you are our guests
(he steps back) am Gaston de marais -- this is my family's plantation
It has been such for 121 years
It will be such after  die
This is my son, Philippe -- he has fought in Algeria and held the rank of Captain
And Henry LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was at Dien Bien Phu
My personal servant, Tran Van Kac --- Then he motions to the trees
young man in a tiger suit and three women come forward from different positions -- all wear bush clothing and bear weapons
(continuing) My youngest son -- Christian -- 161    - He carries an -60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of ammunition trailing off behind him
Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie -- tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an -16
(continuing) And my youngest daughter -- Claudine
162 an attractive girl about eighteen
She wears a red paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit
She carries an -79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition
163    -
- , , They stand there, exhausted and amazed
Philippe yells in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits, heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them
They look the Americans over warily and assemble at Philippe's command
American weapons
We took them from the dead
(smiles) Now --  assume you want to rest, to shower
We'll attend to your repairs after dinner
Shower
Willard's men look at one another, dazed
We don't want to bother you any, we -- man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain
Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks up his -16 by the stock
habit of men of war, sir -- you understand
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity
The men are relieved
They pick up their weapons and follow
What about the boat
My men will keep it for you -- Yeah -- well, 'll stay with the boat
Chief
(pause) Come with us
They look at each other a moment
The Chief shrugs and follows
164    -  - , , Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc- ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire
suitable accomodation for your men, captain -- you will, of course, be quartered with us -- He indicates that the men should follow Philippe
The Chief is hesitant
Go ahead -- Philippe leads them on, muttering
Captain, this way
Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and about thirty feet deep
The bottom is filled with water and young French and Vietnamese children swim in it
On the opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns
Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride
(continuing) Magnificent, eh, Captain
Willard looks
(continuing) It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good have never seen one like it in all Indochina
was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused -- Looks like a two thousand pound to me
Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb
No, 've seen those in Normandy
This is much better
(pause) My country -- my country could never originate this
Magnificent
Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard looks between him and this big hole in the ground in amezement
165
'  - foreman's shower from the old plantation days
The Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted
Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy, caked with blood
His reaction is odd; rather than just stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened, reluctant to step in
Chef is waiting behind him
hot shower, hot damn
He pushes him forward into the water
The dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is
166
-
- battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese guard at the boat
167
'  - beautiful European room with tall ceilings
Still elegantly furnished, although old and decaying
Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet
His battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and burns
He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above which is a large mirror
There is an album on the marble top of the dresser
He turns to a page at random
168 haggard, looking down at the album
(
) wondered -- how long has this room been like this; how long has the furniture been standing in these places
169 Some old photographs of people standing around a car in the 20's in front of the plantation
Another picture shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the plantation
(
) Was it like this sixty years ago
Eighty years
But here, even eighty years is nothing
He turns the page, The plantation being built
Pictures of the framing, skeletal against the sky and jungle
170 fascinated (
) It was jungle, once; and it will be jungle, again
171 Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc- tures
Then another picture of the jungle site where it was to be built
172 He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish mirror
He barely recognizes himself
173 Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out- of-time room
174
- the long table, covered with delicious food
The
crew sits with others of the De Marais group
The table is headed by St
LeFevre
Chef's face lights up as he regards the wonderful European-style food
This food is wonderful
can't believe the chef is a slope
(turning to Clean) Some more
Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands
(continuing) Hey -- Lance
Huh
Oh
Um, wouldya
wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni, please
And then he looks to his friends for approval
Our   that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another, more elaborate table, where the De Marais family is dining with Willard
Our through the curtain and settles in a   of the group
The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room
Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair next to him
Roxanne,  hope you are feeling better
Je vais bien maintenant
May  present Captain Willard
He is of a paratroop regiment
You know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier, don't you , my dear
(smiling and taking Willard's hand) Yes, they come from the sky
She sits -- there's an uneasy silence
Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him, and the ongoing conversation on the other
He is forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne
would like to know more about the
uh, plaque
Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it
Attacks repulsed, as  was saying
(hard) This is only  for this war, Captain
Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise
(pause) Americain -- 6
Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain
Of course
-- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here
Captain
You'll get blown outta here some day
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home
Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that
The Vietnamese think it's theirs --  guess the Americans do, too
But we civilized it
place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree
always thought the French came here to get the rubber
Excuse me,  must attend to my men
He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife
May  ask where the Captain is going in his little boat
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am
Upriver
Why upriver
There is nothing there, only jungle
Do you know that jungle
When  was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt
There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man
What about an American named Kurtz
There is a pause
We have never heard of him
Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand
(continuing) Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit, Captain
Willard turns
Good night
Gaston leaves
Willard and Roxanne are left alone
The servants clear the table
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- , my husband
Gaston -- his wife and son
'm sorry to hear that
(rising) Cognac
should be checking on the boat
The war will still be here tomorrow
She walks out of the room
(thinking) guess so
He follows
175
-   - Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands
Do you miss your home, Captain
Have you someone there
No
Not really
was discharged from the army four years ago
went home, wasted some time, bought a Mustang Mach 1, drove it a week
Then re-upped for another tour
No, everything  love is here
Then you are like us
She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit
(continuing) What will you do after the war
just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones
What's a big question
Kurtz
(pause) know you've heard of him
Yes
What did you hear
That strange things
terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz
What things
Gaston would never tell me
It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain
Yes
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages
know
But Captain,  mean -- cannibals
long pause
Then she looks at the cognac she poured for him
(continuing) What a pity, you don't drink
Since my husband died, there are so many things  must do alone
She takes a sip
Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left partly open to let a breeze in
He steps onto a terrace overlooking the river
176
-
-  - machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover- ing the front of house, from the river
(from the sitting room) Are you warm, Captain
The river is beautiful
In fact, we  that he is checking the boat
177  '
The
is under guard by a couple of Gaston's Vietnamese
176
, She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes up behind him
spend hours watching that river from my bedroom window
It fascinates me
She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is kissing her
179    , One eye steals another look at the
180
Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready for the long night
181    ,  - His hands wander over her body as she clings to him
Then she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting room, and up the stairs
182
'  - It is dark
She leads him into her room and closes the door
He stands there
In the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it
The windows also have netting and barbed wire -- there is a
30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one
He look around
she goes over to the bed, and turns down the sheets
Then she slips out of her dress and stands there facing him
He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt
She lays down on the bed and watches him
have been lonely here, Captain
He moves to her, slipping into the bed
-16 is leaning against the wall in his reach
183
'  - We can  into the room, as Willard has silently slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure kneeling in final preparations for going out in the night
Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing into the darkness
184
-
- Two Vietnamese guard the
-- suddenly, feet first, the first disappears into the thicket
185 in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with a knife
Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick work of him with his knife
He even enjoys it
Silently, he drags the body out of sight
186
The dark figure boards the boat silently
He disappears into the hold
187 He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly, with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his best work alone, and at night
188
'  -   -  - He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we moving around in the room
He wakes suddenly -- Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up her blouse
She notices he is awake and smiles
will fix you breakfast
He starts to get up
'm afraid  won't have time -- gotta -- Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two -16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order
He stops -- seemingly stunned
So that's it
You may think what you wish, Captain, but  like you very much
She turns to go
What if  say no
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you
She leaves
189
-   - , He walks down onto the dock
Gaston's men are transferring ammunition boxes
Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the Chief and crew with -16's
Two of my men deserted last night
It happens from time to time
assume my daughter told you of our conditions
Your daughter
They taking half our ammo, Captain -- said it was your orders
He pauses for a second
That's right --  did
The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the engines
Willard looks hard at Gaston
guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it
Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp
all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets
(pause) Au revoir, Captain
190    -  -
Willard climbs on board and it pulls away
191
-
- , The   out across the river
The Chief looks over at Willard
They stare at each other for a moment
Next time we  get in a good fire fight -- 'd like to know how she was, Captain
Willard just smiles at the Chief
he leans over and pulls up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains the contents of all those ammo boxes
50 calibre; clips; grenades
Holy shit
What did you put in all those ammo boxes
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted
When'd you do it
While you were sleeping
He lets the board drop
Willard moves to the back of the boat
192    -
-  , The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark and deep
The trees are higher in this area and much of the river is shaded on one side
There is no undergrowth, just the tall trees and ferms
They move ahead at half speed, alert, ready for anything
(
) We moved deeper and deeper into the jungle
It was very quiet there
It was like wandering on a prehistoric planet, an unknown world
where the men thought they crawled to,  don't know
For me, we crawled toward Kurtz -- exclusively
Willard looks out ahead and points
They all turn their guns in that direction
We a small village of huts along the bank
193    -   - 194
They pass in front of the village which is rundown and completely deserted
The huts are on stilts to avoid the flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what they once were
(
) Flood
(
) No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease
(
) don't know -- there'd still be some sign -- it's just like the one this morning
: 195    -   - The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across the river filtering the sun
The forest itself has grown darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers
Strange birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge snake slips along an overheading limb
The depth of the jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting
196    -  - Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls upon the boat
It is the shadow cast by an enormous vertical tail section of a -52 bomber thrusting out from the mud
Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi- dizing in the sun
Creepers have already started to grow up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it
But once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway gateway to paradise
The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and seductive
The hills beyond are purple and lush
Strange orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way
The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there were no bottom
The sun is warm and the breeze gentle and laced with wild gardenians
It is indeed the most peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon it and has never known such a sense of peace and well- being
Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into hell
Here is all that can be had of earth
But no hand moves
The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of the clearing
hole into the jungle from which a darkness permeats
The boat follows the river into this hole
: 197    -
-  - The skull looms in the f
g
-- the
is pulled back about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on the water -- as it clears, we  another post and skulls on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet
-- All right, Lance -- Lance's   split the silence as they  into the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a tremendous  and   from the jungle as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from obviously set to cover the mound of skulls
The smoke clears
The other one -- No -- leave it -- Why -- Charlie put it there to kill -- Thta's not Charlie's work -- There is silence
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs -- Signs
Yeah -- like keep out -- Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead past the smoking mound
198
-  - The
pushed deeper into this mysterious area
Mist swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into an obscure fog
The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast
(
) Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz' base
Everything was still, the trees, the creepers, even the brush seemed like it had been changed into some kind of stone
It was unnatural, like a trance
Not a sound could be heard
began to think  was deaf -- then the fog came suddenly, and  was blind too
The boat disappears in the thick fog
199 We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close
Listen
What is it
Listen
They are silent
We can  the most ominous The ,

No, Lance
Not while you can't see

Will they attack
If they have boats
or canoes
they'd get lost in the fog
We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore
God
Sounds like hundreds of them
Shhhhhh
The    in unbearable
But it is not ahostile cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the (continuing) It doesn't sound hostile -- it sounds like they've seen us coming and it sounds like -- don't know, a funeral don't understand
203 glimpse of him, almost in tears
We then  glimpses, fog moving, of all the men on the

-
the thinning mist
The Navy craft proceeds cautiously
(
) Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp
We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river
Which way
Right or left
Who knows
Right
Looks pretty shallow
The
moves toard the right-most channel
Chef takes a long pole and begins sounding depth
205 The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from bank to bank
Chief keeps his fingers on an -16
Willard takes out the   packet he received at Do Lung
Tears it open
We    him
(reading) Upon reaching objective
Target key personnel and commence operation
Should difficulty arise from which extraction is impossible, break radio silence Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm -- indicate purgative air strike -- code -- Street Gang
(pause) Purgative air strike
Purgative
They'd kill me too
Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow
Hundreds and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the
rattling against the boat
Shit
Fucking arrows
They're shooting fucking arrows at us
206 looking toward the banks
207  ' Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes entangled in the dense jungle gloom
And hundreds of pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them
208
crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the childish assault
Steer her right
209
arrows hitting the deck
The men open up everything they've got
Lance is  the two fifties wildly
Keep going
keep going
They're just fucking sticks
Chief, stay at the helm
But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his -16 go
Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands, and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having caught him right through the ribs
Willard looks down in horror
210 laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him, bleeding onto Willard's boots
He looks up at Willard, about to say something
spear
He dies
211
The men are still crazily  into the empty jungle long after those who attacked beat their retreat
Stop it
Stop it Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief
They are absolutely soaked in blood
He is stunned -- sits down and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off
Chief's dead
Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot in his hand
(
) It was the strangest thing -- don't know that  can explain it
Two of my men dead, and all could think of was whether Kurtz was dead too
That's all wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear Kurtz
He starts to wipe the blood off the boot
(
) (continuing) Somehow, in the middle of this
carnival, Kurtz had grown into something -- a gifted officer; a great man
Somehow, he was the only light in this hopeless, hopeless darkness
And now  was too late -- he was probably gone, disappeared
by a grenade rolled into his tent -- or by some spear on the head
Christ,  felt like howling like those animals in the fog
212
- The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat
Some flashbulbs are going off
Some people are dancing to the
Willard, on the edge of the party
(
) Here they are in Los Angeles
Everything is safe
There's a supermarket around the corner, the police station around the other
It would seem ridiculous to them that  was shot to hell because  had lost the privilege of listening to the mysterious Colonel Kurtz
(pause) Of course  was wrong
He was waiting for me
Kurtz was alive and he was waiting for me
: 213
- The
moving up the river
The men are practically in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river
They don t even make an effort to touch their weapons
214 Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face paint of the most savage nature
But there is a purity about them, men and boys, standing passively watching the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red, white and blue
215
The men of the crew are not the same men who began this voyage
Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance
The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the savages that stand before them
The Chef has made a hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun
He wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth
Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the difficult journey
They start to move to their gun positions
Just stand here with me where they can see us
Do nothing
216
the fantastic human wall of feathers and war paint, standing on canoes across the river
The men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly without weapons
The natives standing across the river make no hostile gestures as they approach
They accept the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi- tability
The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little boat to penetrate
217 Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks something like atribal chieftan himself
His intuition was right
He senses that they would be allowed to pass
218 Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping pace with the
There is no hostility in these faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief
219    , They look up toward the bank
220 The temple at   , a fortified encampment, built around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization
Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze around the fortress
221 He picks up his field glasses and looks through

He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving frantically to the
The of him
223 not believing what he's just seen
224 Once again the young black man is now waving his Australian hat
225
Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter
We've been attacked
(shouting back) know,  know, it's all right
Come in this way
It's mined over there
This way
It's all right
Willard look at Chef who is at the helm
He shrugs and they do as this man says
The
moves towards the water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire
The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding them safely in
thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle
Near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub- merged in the water
Other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire
Fire literally burns from out of the ground
Chef nods at the bodies
Charlie
Looks that way
(looking at the Australian) Who's he
God knows
The boat pulls up
The Australian harlequin hops on board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat- tered with mud and blood
(continuing) Who the hell are you
Moonby
Got any Winstons
Moonby what
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force
Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted (incredulously, indicating the hundreds of natives) What is this
Oh, they're simple enough people
It's good to see you, baby
Nobody has any Winstons
Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston
This boat's a mess
Where's Kurtz
want to talk to him
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz
(he puffs, then smiles) You listen to him
God, these are good
kept these people off you, you know
It wasn't easy
Why did they attack us
Simple
They don't want him to go
You're Australian
Pre-Australian, actually
But 'd dig goin' to California
'm California dreamin'
(almost to himself) So Kurtz is alive
Kurtz
tell you, that man has enlarged my mind
He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his mind's expansion
(continuing) But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that 've come on so far
He wanted to shoot me
The first thing he said is, ''m going to shoot you because you are a deserter
'  said didn't desert from your army, deserted from my army
He said, ''m going to shoot you just the same
' Why didn't he shoot you
've asked myself that question
said to myself, why didn't he shoot me
He didn't shoot me, because  had a stash like you wouldn't believe
hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle
and Acid --  make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss
Now 'm Kurtz' own Disciple --  listen he talks
About everything
Everything
forgot there's such a thing as sleep
Everything
Of love, too
Love
Oh, no, not what you think
Cosmic love
He made me see things -- things, you know
The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress
226  '  - Men in small groups, huddled over food
Now he settles on the entrance in the temple
There are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible shrunken heads
227 Sounds like he's gone crazy
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy
Is that where he is
By the shrunken heads
Those heads, yes
Well, the rebels
(to his men) We're going ashore
Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance
What
Bring your rifles, that's all
(looking at Moonby) Take us to him
Right on -- he's been waiting for -- And shut up
Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the
willard and the men follow
228    - , As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle
They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before
They wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition
their bodies are painted in strange patterns
They carry Army -16's, Russian -47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs
Women emerge from the brush as well
they are armed and equally primitive looking
Interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of Army insignia on them
The paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre
We the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky
Willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of Captain Cook
They encounter, in the center of the group, what once appears to have been an American
he is tall, gaunt, wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a loincloth
His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke, strange camouflage patterns
His hair and beard are long, matted with mud and grease
He carries an -47 decorated with scalps and human ears
Willard approaches this beast, who seems shy and retiring
Who are you
(breaking in) His name is
'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again
Moonby shuts up
The  tries to speak, but nothing comes out
He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they are to see him
Colby
Exec
officer, -Team
Special Forces
-82 -- Col
Walter Kurtz, commanding
What happened here
What -- happened here
Charlie
regulars
They're coming again tonight
Tet -- their big -- assault
Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what to say to this man, but he understands the forces that pounded him
He takes his arm
229 looks at Willard, not understanding
230 Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical
'm taking you back
Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand
Oh, no, don t say that
Take us back
Take us back
But, the operation -- the team
Colonel Kurtz has such plans for -- the team
Take me to him, Major
Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard: had nothing to do with these operations --  did not do the planning -- none of us did
It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he was the genius
You'll see -- the genius of our Colonel
He should be made a General, don't you think
General
It's
Suddenly, frightened, he stops
Without looking Willard knows that Kurtz is standing behind him
He turns
Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is a powerful man, though obviously very ill
He slowly attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together, though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as well as his
Colonel's insignia
He is feverish, with long blonde hair and beautiful features
His eyes almost hypnotize
His midsection is bandaged from what seems to be a serious wound
232 This is not what he expected
He is quiet, and then, automatically, he comes to an attention
Colonel Kurtz,  guess
'm Kurtz
(he salutes) Captain
Willard reporting his presence, sir
233 looking at him a long time
Then he returns the salute, and simply: At ease
(pause, as he regards him) Sit down
234 There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair
But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on the ground, cross-legged
Finally, Willard sits as well
Then Kurtz does
Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from man to man, ritualistically
(slowly) Why did you come to
my province
We were attacked -- down river
We need supplies and medical help
You were not coming here, to see me
(finding it more and more difficult to go on with this lie) No -- no, sir
You came up my river -- in that small boat
So simple always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did
(pause) You are the final justice, aren't you
What do you mean, Colonel
(gently) What other reason could you have come
Captain
Ranger
Paratrooper
Graduate of the Recondo School
Am  right about these things
You know you're right
There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man
Then the Agency approached you
Maybe in a bar in Quinon or Pleiku
Simple
year's pay for one life
Perhaps a village elder, or a tax collector
Nobody's orders but your own
Exciting work
235 He remains silent
236 He smiles
You've spent tome at the Royal Tracking School of Malaysia
can tell from the way the laces on your boots are tied
understand you, Captain
We understand each other
There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other
Then Willard reaches to his holstered
45 -- withdraws it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin
Do you know me
Yes
Kurtz reaches down; takes the
45 -- and without another word or gesture, shoots and kills a man
(continuing) Do you know me He throws the
45 back on the dirt
Rises, and walks back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken heads
Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful distance behind
Even Willard is stunned
Holy shit
237
'  -   - Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like a primitive civilization
238 Willard is alone by a campfire -- his -16 leans by a wall next to him
He is exhausted
Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away
Chef approaches, crouches down
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and regulars
There's gonna be a big offense any time
know
Lance stirs; starts to wake up
What are we doing here
Kurtz
'm supposed to kill him, just like he said
Yeah,  can see that
He's fuckin nuts -- Yeah
He killed that guy without feeling anything
Not a thing
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something
Sure
(thinking) Recoil
feel the recoil of my rifle
Willard rises
Chef looks at him, confused and frightened
239    -  - ,  , Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged and dug out every so often for an -60 or a mortar emplacement
Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to Willard as he passes
This is good -- triple overlapping fields of fire -- walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces
woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker
with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires
men, women and children
Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried scalps hang from barbed wire
child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat
(continuing) 've done things, when  was alone in the jungle -- that never told anyone about
They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying
It has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire
The wreck lays on its side so that a 7
62 mini-gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags
The emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond
Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner, sit near the gun
Several Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets
This is evil -- evil, Captain
We're all gonna die here
Yeah,  know
don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him
Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here
This  Kurtz is ruining the war;  mean, this don't look good for America
(lost in his thoughts) he's an amazing officer
You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don' t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain --  don't wanna die here -- Do it quick
Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant
He sort of nods, sucking a joint
Yeah
know
He thinks
240
- -- Willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads
Chef and Lance with him
Willard steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting
241  ' An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head- quarters
Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone
We  what is left of the maps and other military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse
There are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been
Now all those things are no longer impor- tant
Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair
There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage
There are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted
" Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to Willard
He's asleep -- don't bother him
'm awake
Willard steps in closer
Kurtz looks to Moonby
(continuing) You
Get out
Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with Willard
(continuing; suddenly) said get the fuck out
(to himself) 'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow
(he shows some pain when moving his midsection) He s only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic
He knows how to use a hypodermic
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of regulars
That's right, the little gook- pricks
But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble
Because they fight with their guts, like animals
And for an idea
That's rich
We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing
But 'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight
We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow
How do you like The Doors': ''mon Baby Light My Fire
' Willard shrugs
(continuing) Do you
Yeah,  like it
love it
He rests back, grinning
You've gone crazy
(angrily) No
My thinking is clear
(calmly) But my soul has gone mad
Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his stomach wound
He groans horribly, clutching at it
He literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor
(continuing) My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut
Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the wound
242
- Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in, witnessing the proceedings inside
(muttering) Kill him -- come on, why don't you kill him 243
- ,  -    - Willard examining the wound
(in pain) Oh shit -- on the table; morphine
Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet
He takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing Kurtz and injects him with the drug
(continuing; looking up in pain) You see how stupid it would have been to blow out my brains
'm dying from the gut anyway
Willard quickly prepares another shot
Kurtz, truly frightened, holds up his hand
(continuing) No --  don't want to sleep
want to think
Water
Give me water
You can't have water after morphine
Still playing by the rules
(almost affectionately) You're a damn good kiler
(still holding the second morphine) How's the pain
How's yours
can handle it
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility
the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle
What Truth
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it
And do you know why
(looks at him) Yes, you know why
(he looks) Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it
Asshole Schmuck How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here
(coldly) Except me
He rests back
The drug is beginning to take effect
(continuing) Gimme water
No water
You know what you're doing
You are interfering with my plans He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches him impassively
(continuing) This water's got Moonby's acid in it -- He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all over
Then he throws the canteen to Willard
(continuing) Drink it -- drink it for tonight
Think of it
whole regiment of those shitty little Cong -- War
Total war -- war like you've never known it
It's beautiful -- you'll love it
Trust me
244
-
-    - We can  into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen to Willard
Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out
Lance -- the fucker's not gonna do it
Goddamn -- You've gotta dig napalm on Speed, too
It's spectacular, you'll see
Lance stands up holding his -16, looks into the cavern with Chef
245
- Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his hand
Look into the jungle
You can't -- it's too terrible
You have to smear yourself with warpaint to look at it -- you have to be a cannibal
(whispered) That's why warpaint was invented
Then it becomes your jungle
Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine
How did we get here
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie think think a lie stinks
Oh Captain, that is so true
Stinks
could never figure -- (he drinks from the canteen) could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes
Willard drinks more of the  water
(angrily) You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense
Fuck no
'll tell you what makes sense
Air strikes White Phosphorus Napalm We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want
We'll exterminate the fuckers
Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified
He draws his bayonet
Captain -- kill him
Think of it -- for years, millions of years, savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would rain down from the sky
And goddamn, we made it happen
God bless Dow Kill him
Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively, Willard  him -- then there is additional automatic Chef is being riddled by bullets
246 He has let loose with his -16 at Chef, like some sort of mindless, programmed killer
() Hot damn
Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an instant of silence, then: 247
- The  begin    , loud and overwhelming, as illuminating flares light up the blackness
248 of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of razor-sharp concertina wire
is blasted out to the enemy, poised to attack
249 Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait
Bay- onets are fixed
Men are stoned to acid, injecting speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish in water pipes
One looks up to the sky
250 rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche- delic hallucination
251 Wow
Another behind him is chanting the word  softly t himself
252 Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions around the gate
He looks like a magnificent warrior -- Genghis
All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans, even the savage men of the
crew either bow, salute or kneel before Willard
The color pulsates around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and purple
We  Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of teeth around his neck, his face painted
253    - Enemy   away at the fortress
254    - hand drops a shell and it
255    - It
around the fort, red and orange and blue and green
They hit and grow, outward like some sort of cosmic flower
256    -  - ( ) Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy
257 blasting out music
258 With the , like those people you see listening to radios in their cars
259       -  ,  , (In  ) Shells  in and  on the walls in the compound
The men behind them are setting up rocket launcher (missile)
Everywhere metal and rock and flame fly and it is beautiful to see
Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope
260   - - Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach- ing the outer perimeters
Thousands of them

When they  the  is incredibly loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn
solid stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as 7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy
The pass of the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser- geant sweeps the area
The sergeant laughs maniacally as the  resumes , right up to the moment he is blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell
263 Exhilarated, and moving with the
Napalm
Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il- luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm beautiful, like a magnificent firework
264 Claymores, claymores
The   of tremendous penetrate the track of    one after another
Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these
His face seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv- ing in front of us
The  of maimed and dismembered men almost pene- trates the    and we  Kurtz's men and  in delight
Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter
265    - through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more extreme
They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm but press relentlessly on
overhead
They chant to themselves as they advance
have reached the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up
Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce weird psychedelic light
Blared out at tremendous vol- ume over and above the    is
266    -  - The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming
Spurred by , they charge up
-16's in both hands, blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats, biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most horrible savagery
267
- standing on the wall  as bodies fall around him; he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with a foot and stabs another
From him he takes his AK47 and more as they come
268
- The  rush his position
Willard trips a claymore that most of them to shreads
More fill in
Lance opens up
Willard and Lance move down to the nest wall,  , bodies tumbling over
Lance is caught in a  and hit several times
He pulls himself up --  a final  and then falls under the enemy's feet
269 sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering madly to himself
270
-
shouting into the radio Code -- Street Gang -- Street Gang
Purgative air strike; Street Gang
He turns and runs back through the compound with the receding Montagnards
are  everywhere
The light patterns are fantastic
Men fall, Viets break over the walls and charge
They crouch and rip into them
They break the charge and continue cutting their way through the  masses like torches through metal
271    -   - Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain
Women and children rush upon him now
Kurtz flicks some switch- es and the whole north wall  in overwhelming
The gates are uprooted
The stone lions tumble, crushing men below
Kurtz cocks an -16 and walks off the bunker
272 watching this spectacle
273
-   - He rounds  the shadow wall
Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a machine gun mount
They don't see him
He braces the gun at his side and steps out
(yelling) Charles
They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one who's merely lost his weapon
Kurtz looks at him, his gun empty
He drops it and flips open the flap of his holster
The Viet soldier goes for his pistol
Kurtz beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night
He moves over to pick up the  light machine gun
Holding it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls and  into the masses
His native men see him and rush for the chance to die beside him
They are quickly encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun
The machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle
When it's empty and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club
274
-   - taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett at the Alamo
275    - The air strike hits with all its force
Balls and rain of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything
It is the biggest firework show in history
The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it
Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the air strike continues
All around us is a spectacle of and light and fire and overwhelming color
276 following Kurtz's trail in the mud
He has crawled on all fours back into the jungle to die
He stalks Kurtz into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the crawling Kurtz Go away -- hide yourself
What are you doing
Going back  - to the jungle to die
'm taking you back
You can still live
had immense plans
'm gonna get you out of here
was on threshold of great things
Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck, holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle
The spectacle continues in the b
g
277
- This wreck of a boat is still afloat
Willard crawls out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat
278 The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of Nu Mung Ba
279
- The entire temple is devastation
Vultures by the hundreds circle overhead
There are a few survivors
Everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies
Colby, a Sergeant, and some Montagnards sit near them
Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally
They stagger away from the field of slaughter
Willard looks down and sees something
Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the f
g
below is Lance, dead
Colby stumbles over
Willard holds Lance up by his hair
Who is he
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war
: 280
battered, moving slowly down the river
281 Colby is at helm
Kurtz lies feverish, delirious
Willard sits by him
As the boat moves, Montagnards, those left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks
Colby takes an automatic weapon and  it into the air
Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him
The battle is not over
Don't
Don't frighten them away
Willard looks down at him
So you understand this
Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his eyes
There is a slight smile
Do  not
282
- The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river
My river
my people
my jungle
my ideas
my country
my wife
(he looks at Willard) my death
You had immense plans
immense plans
Yes
'm taking you back
Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair
whisper at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry that is no more than a breath
The horror, the horror
We  the distant  of  approaching
The  of  in the distance
They look up, craning their eyes at the sky
Colby points
There
Over the jungle mountains the small formation of helicopters hooping toward them
(continuing) How did they know
They must have seen the fire
The helicopters are closer now but high up
Two of them breaking off, spiraling in
They're coming to rescue us
They're Medevac
283 He stares up at the sky
(to himself) They're coming to take us back
Copters directly overhead
(continuing) Yeah
Colonel Kurtz, he's dead
Yeah
He raises his -16 and  the entire clip at the ap- proaching rescue helicopter
284    - It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the sky
285    - , Yeah
Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in  at the retreating American helicopters
286  '  - The men in the boat    as we fly further into the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller
(
) Don't remember a lot about my rehabilitation
but  was sent back to the world before the fall of Saigon
287
-    - back to the pleasure boat at the Marina
Pause
Willard is very silent
never answered questions about Kurtz --  gave them a few of his unimportant papers -- but for the most part  saved everything
There were other letters, personal ones written earlier to his wife
brought them to het
watched the fall of Saigon on television in a bar in Alameda
289
- bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh- borhood
Some kids are playing in the street
Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under his arm
He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working on a motor-scooter
Willard looks at him
The boy looks back
Hi
Then the door opens, and '  is standing at the door
She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in mourning even though she doesn't wear black
There is a sense of purity about her, though she is not young
' Come in, Captain Willard
He enters
289
'  - Everything good and secure and desirable about America
She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous
' Can  get anything for you
There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many
but he is there in the various stages of his career
Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her
' (continuing) Did you know him very well
You get to know each other pretty well out there
' And you admired him
He was a remarkable man
It was impossible not to -- ' Love him
Yes, it is true
That's the hard part for me knew him better than anyone knew him best
You knew him best
' You were his friend
You must have been, if he had given you this
(the packet) If he sent you to his home
He was the best this country had -- he was -- Yes,  know
' 'll never get over it -- But 'll always remember him
Both of us
' Men looked up to him
(she loses herself in a thought) He died as he lived
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived
' Were you with him, when
Yes  was
He said his last words to me
Pause
290 little of the madness is still with him
He knows what she will ask
' What were they
291
' ' Tell me
292 remembering that incredible day moving down the river
Our ' Tell me what he said

) The horror
The horror
He spoke of you, ma'am
He sits there looking at her
